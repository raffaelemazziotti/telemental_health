### Title: **Telepsychiatry: psychiatric consultation by interactive television**
#### Authors: Dwyer T.F.
#### Abstract: The author describes an interactive television (IATV) system set up between Massachusetts General Hospital and a medical station in Boston. The system has proven to be feasible and acceptable to individuals and institutions in the community, providing psychiatric skills on a much wider scale, in a more accessible way, and faster than any other system. The author delineates the implications and future uses that appropriately placed IATV links could have, such as significantly multiplying existing manpower and more evenly distributing psychiatric care without placing greater demands on manpower.

### Title: **Telepsychiatry: Psychiatric consultation through two-way television. A controlled study**
#### Authors: Dongier M., Tempier R., Lalinec-Michaud M., Meunier D.
#### Abstract: Telepsychiatry (consultation carried out through 2-way interactive television) has been the object of a number of trials in the past twenty years, but to our knowledge there is no previous control study which compares CCTV and face-to-face intreviews. Various aspects of the interviews carried out on CCTV were rated on a 5-point scale in questionnaires filled out by: patients; consultees and; consultants. No significant difference was elicited with control interviews in respect to patients' diagnosis, age and sex. CCTV interview ratings by consultee and consultant were rated only slightly below those of the control group. Such findings should encourage a broader application of interactive CCTV, particularly as a complement to live consultations in distant areas.

### Title: **Telemedicine--clinical applications in mental health.**
#### Authors: Kavanagh S.J., Yellowlees P.M.
#### Abstract: Video conferences and the Telepsychiatry applications allow for an alternative approach to service delivery in rural areas. They rely heavily on user support and access to a suitably wide network. The ISDN transmission medium is capable of excellent audio and visual quality, but the consequence of this high grade quality is higher transmission costs. Our experiences have so far been positive. No patient has refused to use the medium, nor has any patient walked out of an interview without returning. It is possible to assess patients with a wide range of psychiatric disorders from personality disorders through to frank and severe psychosis. It is hard to see how the system could be used for formal insight oriented dynamic psychotherapy, but there is no reason why it should not be used for review type case management assessments and consultations as discussed in this paper. The interviewing techniques used on Telemedicine require further evaluation but are exciting and interesting, and can probably teach us a great deal about how we might improve our clinical interviewing style. The difficulties in providing equitable services extend beyond access to country centres. Low population densities and cultural diversity, typical for much of remote Australia, demands an alternative approach for effective service provision. While video conferences cannot solve the inequity in service delivery, they can work as a useful adjunct to current service delivery strategies.

### Title: **Telepsychiatry: 'Tele' yes, but what about the 'psychiatry'?**
#### Authors: Baigent M.F., Lloyd C.J., Kavanagh S.J., Ben-Tovim D.I., Yellowlees P.M., Kalucy R.S., Bond M.J.
#### Abstract: To investigate what is lost or gained in a psychiatric evaluation when it takes place via telepsychiatry we compared the inter-rater reliability between two psychiatrists interviewing 63 subjects in an observer/interviewer split configuration in telepsychiatry and same-room settings. The measures used were the BPRS and interviewer ratings from a semi-structured interview. Patients also rated their experience. There were some clear differences between the telepsychiatry and same-room evaluations. Despite these variations, diagnoses were as reliably made by telepsychiatry. Patient acceptance of telepsychiatry was high.

### Title: **Cost evaluation of a telepsychiatry service in northern Queensland**
#### Authors: Trott P., Blignault I.
#### Abstract: We conducted a simple comparison of the costs associated with delivering a mental health service by telepsychiatry and by conventional methods. The telepsychiatry rural outreach service was delivered to a mining town 900 km from the regional hospital in Townsville. When the telemedicine service was well established, 40 cases a month were seen for general adult psychiatry, four for child and adolescent mental health, four for psychology and two for forensic services. Costs and quality-of-life issues were considered. The savings to the health authority were estimated to be $85,380 in the first year and $112,790 in subsequent years, not allowing for maintenance and equipment upgrading. We also estimated a 40% reduction in patient transfers due to the introduction of telemedicine. Based on the previous year's figures of 27 transfers at $8920 each, this would produce an annual saving of $96,336 for the Royal Flying Doctor Service. The results of the study showed considerable savings from reduced travel by patients and health-care workers.

### Title: **Evaluation of a telepsychiatry pilot project**
#### Authors: Doze S., Simpson J., Hailey D., Jacobs P.
#### Abstract: We assessed a telepsychiatry pilot project in which a psychiatric hospital was linked with mental health clinics in five general hospitals. Information was collected through questionnaires administered to patients, service providers and psychiatric consultants, and by interviews. The technology was considered easy to use by participating health-care professionals and patients, and the quality of the sound and picture was adequate. Survey data suggested acceptance and satisfaction on the part of patients, service providers and psychiatric consultants. An economic analysis indicated that at 396 consultations per year the service cost the same as providing a travelling psychiatrist (C$610 per consultation); with more consultations, telepsychiatry was cheaper. Information gathered during the evaluation suggested that the use of videoconferencing for psychiatric consultations was a viable option for an integrated, community-based mental health service.

### Title: **A randomized, controlled trial of child psychiatric assessments conducted using videoconferencing**
#### Authors: Elford R., White H., Bowering R., Ghandi A., Maddiggan B., St John K., House M., Harnett J., West R., Battcock A.
#### Abstract: We used a PC-based videoconferencing system to conduct child psychiatry assessments. The telecommunications link was six digital lines, giving a total bandwidth of 336 kbit/s. Twenty-three patients (aged 4-16 years), accompanied by their parents, completed two psychiatric assessments, one via videoconferencing and another face to face (FTF). The order of assessments was randomized. Questionnaires were used to record the diagnosis, treatment recommendations and the psychiatrists', patients' and their parents' satisfaction with each assessment. An independent evaluator concluded that in 22 cases (96%) the diagnosis and treatment recommendations made via the videoconferencing system were the same as those made FTF. The psychiatrists stated that videoconferencing assessments were an adequate alternative to FTF assessments and did not interfere with diagnosis. However, the responses from the psychiatrist satisfaction questionnaire showed that they preferred FTF assessments. No significant difference was found in the patients' or parents' satisfaction responses after the two types of assessment. The majority of children (82%) 'liked' using the telepsychiatry system and six (26%) preferred it to a FTF assessment. Most parents (91%) indicated that they would prefer to use the videoconferencing system than to travel a long distance to see a psychiatrist in person.

### Title: **Assessing telemedicine: A systematic review of the literature**
#### Authors: Roine R., Ohinmaa A., Hailey D.
#### Abstract: Background: To clarify the current status of telemedicine, we carried out a systematic review of the literature. We identified controlled assessment studies of telemedicine that reported patient outcomes, administrative changes or economic assessments and assessed the quality of that literature. Methods: We carried out a systematic electronic search for articles published from 1966 to early 2000 using the MEDLINE (1966-April 2000), HEALTHSTAR (1975-January 2000), EMBASE (1988-February 2000) and CINALH (1982-January 2000) databases. In addition, the HSTAT database (Health Services/Technology Assessment Text, US National Library of Medicine), the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE, NHS Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, United Kingdom), the NHS Economic Evaluation Database and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register were searched. We consulted experts in the field and did a manual search of the reference lists of review articles. Results: A total of 1124 studies were identified. Based on a review of the abstracts, 133 full-text articles were obtained for closer inspection. Of these, 50 were deemed to represent assessment studies fulfilling the inclusion criteria of the review. Thirty-four of the articles assessed at least some clinical outcomes; the remaining 16 were mainly economic analyses. Most of the available literature referred only to pilot projects and short-term outcomes, and most of the studies were of low quality. Relatively convincing evidence of effectiveness was found only for teleradiology, teleneurosurgery, telepsychiatry, transmission of echocardiographic images, and the use of electronic referrals enabling email consultations and video conferencing between primary and secondary health care providers. Economic analyses suggested that teleradiology, especially transmission of CT images, can be cost-saving. Interpretation: Evidence regarding the effectiveness or cost-effectiveness of telemedicine is still limited. Based on current scientific evidence, only a few telemedicine applications can be recommended for broader use.

### Title: **Client satisfaction in a feasibility study comparing face-to-face interviews with telepsychiatry**
#### Authors: Bishop J.E., O'reilly R.L., Maddox K., Hutchinson L.J.
#### Abstract: We carried out a pilot study comparing satisfaction levels between psychiatric patients seen face to face (FTF) and those seen via videoconference. Patients who consented were randomly assigned to one of two groups. One group received services in person (FTF from the visiting psychiatrist) while the other was seen using videoconferencing at 128 kbit/s. One psychiatrist provided all the FTF and videoconferencing assessment and follow-up visits. A total of 24 subjects were recruited. Three of the subjects (13%) did not attend their appointments and two subjects in each group were lost to follow-up. Thus there were nine in the FTF group and eight in the videoconferencing group. The two groups were similar in most respects. Patient satisfaction with the services was assessed using the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8), completed four months after the initial consultation. The mean scores were 25.3 in the FTF group and 21.6 in the videoconferencing group. Although there was a trend in favour of the FTF service, the difference was not significant. Patient satisfaction is only one component of evaluation. The efficacy of telepsychiatry must also be measured relative to that of conventional, FTF care before policy makers can decide how extensively telepsychiatry should be implemented.  2002, Royal Society of Medicine Press Limited.

### Title: **The effectiveness of telepsychiatry measured using the Health of the Nation Outcome Scale and the Mental Health Inventory**
#### Authors: Kennedy C., Yellowlees P.
#### Abstract: In a telepsychiatry project in rural Queensland, data were collected from 124 patients attending hospital and general practice facilities for mental health-care and then again at follow-up one year later. Thirty-two of the patients were dealt with using telepsychiatry. Two health status scales were used to measure effectiveness: the Health of the Nation Outcome Scale (HoNOS), administered by the practitioners; and the Mental Health Inventory (MHI), which was self-administered by the patients. There was a significant difference between the initial assessment and follow-up groups on most subscales of the HoNOS, but no significant difference between the face-to-face and telepsychiatry groups. Similarly, the MHI results showed a significant difference on all subscales between the initial assessment and follow-up groups, but no significant difference between the face-to-face and telepsychiatry groups. Individuals who used and did not use telepsychiatry all had improved health outcome scores on the HoNOS and MHI during the study period. Telepsychiatry was as effective as face-to-face care.

### Title: **Treatment outcomes in depression: Comparison of remote treatment through telepsychiatry to in-person treatment**
#### Authors: Ruskin P.E., Silver-Aylaian M., Kling M.A., Reed S.A., Bradham D.D., Hebel J.R., Barrett D., Knowles III F., Hauser P.
#### Abstract: Objective: Telepsychiatry is an increasingly common method of providing psychiatric care, but randomized trials of telepsychiatric treatment compared to in-person treatment have not been done. The primary objective of this study was to compare treatment outcomes of patients with depressive disorders treated remotely by means of telepsychiatry to outcomes of depressed patients treated in person. Secondary objectives were to determine if patients' rates of adherence to and satisfaction with treatment were as high with telepsychiatric as with in-person treatment and to compare costs of telepsychiatric treatment to costs of in-person treatment. Method: In this randomized, controlled trial, 119 depressed veterans referred for outpatient treatment were randomly assigned to either remote treatment by means of telepsychiatry or in-person treatment. Psychiatric treatment lasted 6 months and consisted of psychotropic medication, psychoeducation, and brief supportive counseling. Patients' treatment outcomes, satisfaction, and adherence and the costs of treatment were compared between the two conditions. Results: Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and Beck Depression Inventory scores improved over the treatment period and did not differ between treatment groups. The two groups were equally adherent to appointments and medication treatment. No between-group differences in dropout rates or patients' ratings of satisfaction with treatment were found. Telepsychiatry was more expensive per treatment session, but this difference disappeared if the costs of psychiatrists' travel to remote clinics more than 22 miles away from the medical center were considered. Telepsychiatry did not increase the overall health care resource consumption of the patients during the study period. Conclusions: Remote treatment of depression by means of telepsychiatry and in-person treatment of depression have comparable outcomes and equivalent levels of patient adherence, patient satisfaction, and health care cost.

### Title: **Cognitive intervention for community-dwelling older persons with memory problems: Telemedicine versus face-to-face treatment**
#### Authors: Poon P., Hui E., Dai D., Kwok T., Woo J.
#### Abstract: Background: Memory complaints and decline in cognitive function are common in the elederly. Cognitive intervention has been shown to be beneficial in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, few community-based cognitive intervention programs are available in Hong Kong. The aim of this project is to examine and compare the feasibility, acceptability, and clinical outcome of a cognitive intervention program for older patients with mild cognitive impairment and mild dementia using telemedicine versus a conventional face-to-face method. Methods: Community-dwelling older subjects with mild dementia or mild cognitive impairments were recruited from a community center. A total of 12 sessions of assessment and cognitive intervention were conducted via videoconferencing or by face-to-face method. Assessment included: Cantonese version of Mini Mental State Examination (C-MMSE), Cantonese version of Rivermead Behavioural Memory test (C-RBMT) and Hierarchic Dementia Scale (HDS). Results: Twenty-two clients were recruited. There was significant and comparable cognitive improvement in clients in both treatment arms. The videoconference arm was highly accepted by the clients and the community center. Overall compliance rate of participants was above 95%. Conclusions: Telemedicine was a feasible, effective and acceptable means in providing cognitive assessment and intervention to older persons with mild cognitive deficits. Promoting such a program to other community settings would further enhance the accessibility of dementia service to the community. Copyright  2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

### Title: **The use of telemedicine in psychiatry**
#### Authors: Norman S.
#### Abstract: This paper examines the potential effects of using video-conferencing within the field of mental health in the UK. In order to assess the usefulness of telepsychiatric services, an electronic search was conducted for articles published between August 1998 and July 2006 using the MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychINFO and Telemedicine and Information Exchange (TIE) databases. The search was carried out using the following terms: telepsychiatry, videoconferencing and telepsychology. A total of 178 articles were identified and based on review of the abstracts 72 were identified as being specific to efficacy, cost-effectiveness and satisfaction with psychiatric services delivered via videoconferencing. This paper concludes that the use of video conferencing can enhance psychiatric services within the UK especially for those patients who live in rural areas. Current advances in technology make this an increasingly more reliable and cost-effective method for assessing patients. The limitations of telemedicine are discussed and it is clear that this type of care is not suitable for all patients. Further research is required to assess the types of patients that telepsychiatry is most suitable for.  2006 The Author.

### Title: **Is telepsychiatry equivalent to face-to-face psychiatry? Results from a randomized controlled equivalence trial**
#### Authors: O'Reilly R., Bishop J., Maddox K., Hutchinson L., Fisman M., Takhar J.
#### Abstract: Objective: The use of interactive videoconferencing to provide psychiatric services to geographically remote regions, often referred to as telepsychiatry, has gained wide acceptance. However, it is not known whether clinical outcomes of telepsychiatry are as good as those achieved through face-to-face contact. This study compared a variety of clinical outcomes after psychiatric consultation and, where needed, brief follow-up for outpatients referred to a psychiatric clinic in Canada who were randomly assigned to be examined face to face or by telepsychiatry. Methods: A total of 495 patients in Ontario, Canada, referred by their family physician for psychiatric consultation were randomly assigned to be examined face to face (N=254) or by telepsychiatry (N=241). The treating psychiatrists had the option of providing monthly follow-up appointments for up to four months. The study tested the equivalence of the two forms of service delivery on a variety of outcome measures. Results: Psychiatric consultation and follow-up delivered by telepsychiatry produced clinical outcomes that were equivalent to those achieved when the service was provided face to face. Patients in the two groups expressed similar levels of satisfaction with service. An analysis limited to the cost of providing the clinical service indicated that telepsychiatry was at least 10% less expensive per patient than service provided face to face. Conclusions: Psychiatric consultation and short-term follow-up can be as effective when delivered by telepsychiatry as when provided face to face. These findings do not necessarily mean that other types of mental health services, for example, various types of psychotherapy, are as effective when provided by telepsychiatry.

#### Abstract: Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) often go undetected in toddlers. The Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT) was used to screen 3,793 children aged 16-30 months from low- and high-risk sources; screen positive cases were diagnostically evaluated. Re-screening was performed on 1,416 children aged 42-54 months. Time1 Positive Predictive Value (PPV) was .36 for the initial screening and .74 for the screening plus follow-up telephone interview; values were similar for Time2 PPV. When separating referral sources, PPV was low for the low-risk sample but acceptable with the follow-up telephone interview. Children with ASD from the low-risk and high-risk samples were highly similar. Results indicate that the M-CHAT continues to be a promising instrument for the early detection of ASD.  2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

### Title: **Patients' depression treatment preferences and initiation, adherence, and outcome: A randomized primary care study**
#### Authors: Raue P.J., Schulberg H.C., Heo M., Klimstra S., Bruce M.L.
#### Abstract: Objective: The authors examined the association of treatment preferences with treatment initiation, adherence, and clinical outcome among nonsenior adult and senior primary care patients with depression. Methods: Sixty primary care participants meeting DSM-IV criteria for major depression were randomly assigned to receive treatment congruent or incongruent with their primary stated preference. Participants received either 20 weeks of escitalopram, with monitoring by a care manager, or 12 weekly sessions of interpersonal psychotherapy followed by two monthly booster sessions. Adherence to treatment and depression severity were reassessed at weeks 4, 8, 12, and 24. Results: Participants expressed stronger preferences for psychotherapy than for antidepressant medication. Preference strength was a more sensitive measure of outcome than was congruence versus incongruence of preference with the assigned treatment. Across age groups, preference strength was significantly associated with treatment initiation and 12-week adherence rate but not with depression severity or remission. Conclusions: A continuous measure of preference strength may be a more useful measure in clinical practice than preferences per se. Future research should focus on whether and how greater facilitation of the treatment decision-making process between patient and clinician influences clinical outcome.

### Title: **Internet treatment for depression: A randomized controlled trial comparing clinician vs. technician assistance**
#### Authors: Titov N., Andrews G., Davies M., Mcintyre K., Robinson E., Solley K.
#### Abstract: Background: Internet-based cognitive behavioural therapy (iCBT) for depression is effective when guided by a clinician, less so if unguided. Question: Would guidance from a technician be as effective as guidance from a clinician? Method: Randomized controlled non-inferiority trial comparing three groups: Clinician-assisted vs. technician-assisted vs. delayed treatment. Community-based volunteers applied to the VirtualClinic (www.virtualclinic.org.au) research program, and 141 participants with major depressive disorder were randomized. Participants in the clinician- and technician-assisted groups received access to an iCBT program for depression comprising 6 online lessons, weekly homework assignments, and weekly supportive contact over a treatment period of 8 weeks. Participants in the clinician-assisted group also received access to a moderated online discussion forum. The main outcome measures were the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 Item (PHQ-9). Completion rates were high, and at post-treatment, both treatment groups reduced scores on the BDI-II (p<0.001) and PHQ-9 (p<0.001) compared to the delayed treatment group but did not differ from each other. Within group effect sizes on the BDI-II were 1.27 and 1.20 for the clinician- and technician-assisted groups respectively, and on the PHQ-9, were 1.54 and 1.60 respectively. At 4-month follow-up participants in the technician group had made further improvements and had significantly lower scores on the PHQ-9 than those in the clinician group. A total of approximately 60 minutes of clinician or technician time was required per participant during the 8-week treatment program. Conclusions: Both clinician- and technician-assisted treatment resulted in large effect sizes and clinically significant improvements comparable to those associated with face-to-face treatment, while a delayed treatment control group did not improve. These results provide support for large scale trials to determine the clinical effectiveness and acceptability of technician-assisted iCBT programs for depression. This form of treatment has potential to increase the capacity of existing mental health services.

### Title: **A web-based tutorial for parents of young children with Autism: Results from a pilot study**
#### Authors: Kobak K.A., Stone W.L., Wallace E., Warren Z., Swanson A., Robson K.
#### Abstract: Objective: Early intervention can significantly improve long-term outcomes for children with autism. Unfortunately, many children do not receive early intervention services due to a critical shortage of trained professionals in this area. To bridge this gap, we evaluated a Web-based parent training tutorial (Enhancing Interactions), based on evidence-based practices and utilizing the Web-based platform to maximize learning. Methods: Twenty-three parents with a child between 18 months and 6 years with an autism spectrum disorder participated. Pre-and posttest scores of parents' knowledge were used to evaluate tutorial effectiveness. The system usability scale (SUS) evaluated technical user-friendliness and the user satisfaction questionnaire (USQ), gauged satisfaction with content. Results: The mean number of correct items on the posttest significantly increased, from 12.6 to 20.4, p<0.001. The mean SUS score was 85 (standard deviation=17), corresponding to a score of "excellent." All participants found the tutorial user friendly, well integrated, and 96% (all but one participant) thought it was easy to use, felt confident using the technical features, and would use a tutorial like this again. On the USQ, all participants found that the tutorial was well organized, clearly presented, and easy to understand; that it increased their knowledge about communicating with their child; and that they felt capable of applying these techniques with their child. Conclusions: The tutorial appears effective in increasing parents' knowledge with high user satisfaction.  2011, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

### Title: **Autism spectrum disorders and autisticlike traits: Similar etiology in the extreme end and the normal variation**
#### Authors: Lundström S., Chang Z., Råstam M., Gillberg C., Larsson H., Anckarsäter H., Lichtenstein P.
#### Abstract: Context: Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) have been suggested to represent the extreme end of a normal distribution of autisticlike traits (ALTs). However, the evidence of this notion is inconclusive. Objective: To study whether there are similar genetic and/or environmental etiologies behind ASDs and ALTs. Design: A nationwide twin study. Participants: Consenting parents of all Swedish twins aged 9 and 12 years, born between July 1, 1992, and December 31, 2001 (n=19 208), were interviewed by telephone to screen for child psychiatric conditions, including ASDs. Main Outcome Measures: Two validated cutoffs for ASDs, 2 cutoffs encompassing the normal variation, and 1 continuous measure of ALTs were used with DeFries- Fulker extreme-end analyses and standard twin study methods. Results: We discerned a strong correlation between the 4 cutoffs and the full variation of ALTs. The correlation was primarily affected by genes. We also found that the heritability for the 4 cutoffs was similar. Conclusion: We demonstrate an etiological similarity between ASDs and ALTs in the normal variation and, with results from previous studies, our data suggest that ASDs and ALTs are etiologically linked. 2012 American Medical Association.

### Title: **The effectiveness of telemental health: A 2013 review**
#### Authors: Hilty D.M., Ferrer D.C., Parish M.B., Johnston B., Callahan E.J., Yellowlees P.M.
#### Abstract: Introduction: The effectiveness of any new technology is typically measured in order to determine whether it successfully achieves equal or superior objectives over what is currently offered. Research in telemental health - in this article mainly referring to telepsychiatry and psychological services - has advanced rapidly since 2003, and a new effectiveness review is needed. Materials and Methods: The authors reviewed the published literature to synthesize information on what is and what is not effective related to telemental health. Terms for the search included, but were not limited to, telepsychiatry, effectiveness, mental health, e-health, videoconferencing, telemedicine, cost, access, and international. Results: Telemental health is effective for diagnosis and assessment across many populations (adult, child, geriatric, and ethnic) and for disorders in many settings (emergency, home health) and appears to be comparable to in-person care. In addition, this review has identified new models of care (i.e., collaborative care, asynchronous, mobile) with equally positive outcomes. Conclusions: Telemental health is effective and increases access to care. Future directions suggest the need for more research on service models, specific disorders, the issues relevant to culture and language, and cost.  2013, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

### Title: **Using technology to deliver mental health services to children and youth: A scoping review**
#### Authors: Boydell K.M., Hodgins M., Pignatiello A., Teshima J., Edwards H., Willis D.
#### Abstract: Objective: To conduct a scoping review on the use of technology to deliver mental health services to children and youth in order to identify the breadth of peer-reviewed literature, summarize findings and identify gaps. Method: A literature database search identified 126 original studies meeting criteria for review. Descriptive numerical summary and thematic analyses were conducted. Two reviewers independently extracted data. Results: Studies were characterized by diverse technologies including videoconferencing, telephone and mobile phone applications and Internet-based applications such as email, web sites and CD-ROMs. Conclusion: The use of technologies plays a major role in the delivery of mental health services and supports to children and youth in providing prevention, assessment, diagnosis, counseling and treatment programs. Strategies are growing exponentially on a global basis, thus it is critical to study the impact of these technologies on child and youth mental health service delivery. An in-depth review and synthesis of the quality of fndings of studies on effectiveness of the use of technologies in service delivery are also warranted. A full systematic review would provide that opportunity.  Canadian Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.

#### Abstract: Objective To test the effectiveness of a telehealth service delivery model for the treatment of children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) that provided pharmacological treatment and caregiver behavior training. Method The Children's ADHD Telemental Health Treatment Study (CATTS) was a randomized controlled trial with 223 children referred by 88 primary care providers (PCPs) in 7 communities. Children randomized to the experimental telehealth service model received 6 sessions over 22 weeks of combined pharmacotherapy, delivered by child psychiatrists through videoconferencing, and caregiver behavior training, provided in person by community therapists who were supervised remotely. Children randomized to the control service delivery model received treatment with their PCPs augmented with a telepsychiatry consultation. Outcomes were diagnostic criteria for ADHD and oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) and role performance on the Vanderbilt ADHD Rating Scale (VADRS) completed by caregivers (VADRS-Caregivers) and teachers (VADRS-Teachers) and impairment on the Columbia Impairment Scale-Parent Version (CIS-P). Measures were completed at 5 assessments over 25 weeks. Results Children in both service models improved. Children assigned to the telehealth service model improved significantly more than children in the augmented primary care arm for VADRS-Caregiver criteria for inattention (2[4] = 19.47, p &lt;.001), hyperactivity (2[4] = 11.91, p =.02), combined ADHD (2[4] = 14.90, p =.005), ODD (2[4] = 10.05, p =.04), and VADRS-Caregiver role performance (2 [4] = 12.40, p =.01) and CIS-P impairment (2[4] = 20.52, p &lt;.001). For the VADRS-Teacher diagnostic criteria, children in the telehealth service model had significantly more improvement in hyperactivity (2[4] = 11.28, p =.02) and combined ADHD (2[4] = 9.72, p =.045). Conclusion The CATTS trial demonstrated the effectiveness of a telehealth service model to treat ADHD in communities with limited access to specialty mental health services.

### Title: **BEHAVIORAL ACTIVATION and THERAPEUTIC EXPOSURE for POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER: A NONINFERIORITY TRIAL of TREATMENT DELIVERED in PERSON VERSUS HOME-BASED TELEHEALTH**

#### Abstract: Objective Combat veterans returning to society with impairing mental health conditions such as PTSD and major depression (MD) report significant barriers to care related to aspects of traditional psychotherapy service delivery (e.g., stigma, travel time, and cost). Hence, alternate treatment delivery methods are needed. Home-based telehealth (HBT) is one such option; however, this delivery mode has not been compared to in person, clinic-based care for PTSD in adequately powered trials. The present study was designed to compare relative noninferiority of evidence-based psychotherapies for PTSD and MD, specifically Behavioral Activation and Therapeutic Exposure (BA-TE), when delivered via HBT versus in person, in clinic delivery. Method A repeated measures (i.e., baseline, posttreatment, 3-, 6-month follow-up) randomized controlled design powered for noninferiority analyses was used to compare PTSD and MD symptom improvement in response to BA-TE delivered via HBT versus in person, in clinic conditions. Participants were 232 veterans diagnosed with full criteria or predefined subthreshold PTSD. Results PTSD and MD symptom improvement following BA-TE delivered by HBT was comparable to that of BA-TE delivered in person at posttreatment and at 3- and 12-month follow-up. Conclusion Evidence-based psychotherapy for PTSD and depression can be safely and effectively delivered via HBT with clinical outcomes paralleling those of clinic-based care delivered in person. HBT, thereby, addresses barriers to care related to both logistics and stigma.  2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

### Title: **Generic versus disorder specific cognitive behavior therapy for social anxiety disorder in youth: A randomized controlled trial using internet delivery**
#### Authors: Spence S.H., Donovan C.L., March S., Kenardy J.A., Hearn C.S.
#### Abstract: The study examined whether the efficacy of cognitive behavioral treatment for Social Anxiety Disorder for children and adolescents is increased if intervention addresses specific cognitive and behavioral factors linked to the development and maintenance of SAD in young people, over and above the traditional generic CBT approach. Participants were 125 youth, aged 817 years, with a primary diagnosis of SAD, who were randomly assigned to generic CBT (CBT-GEN), social anxiety specific CBT (CBT-SAD) or a wait list control (WLC). Intervention was delivered using a therapist-supported online program. After 12-weeks, participants who received treatment (CBT-SAD or CBT-GEN) showed significantly greater reduction in social anxiety and post-event processing, and greater improvement in global functioning than the WLC but there was no significant difference between CBT-SAD and CBT-GEN on any outcome variable at 12-weeks or 6-month follow-up. Despite significant reductions in anxiety, the majority in both treatment conditions continued to meet diagnostic criteria for SAD at 6-month follow-up. Decreases in social anxiety were associated with decreases in post-event processing. Future research should continue to investigate disorder-specific interventions for SAD in young people, drawing on evidence regarding causal or maintaining factors, in order to enhance treatment outcomes for this debilitating condition.  2016 Elsevier Ltd

### Title: **Evaluating an e-mental health program (“deprexis”) as adjunctive treatment tool in psychotherapy for depression: Results of a pragmatic randomized controlled trial**
#### Authors: Berger T., Krieger T., Sude K., Meyer B., Maercker A.
#### Abstract: Background Depressive disorders place a significant disease burden on individuals as well as on societies. Several web-based interventions for depression have shown to be effective in reducing depressive symptoms. However, it is not known whether web-based interventions, when used as adjunctive treatment tools to regular psychotherapy, have an additional effect compared to regular psychotherapy for depression. Methods Adults (N = 98) with a unipolar affective disorder were recruited in routine outpatient psychotherapy practices in Germany from therapists over the course of their initial sessions and randomized within therapists to one of two active treatment conditions: regular psychotherapy or psychotherapy plus a web-based depression program (deprexis). Primary outcome was depressive symptoms measured with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) at 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes were anxiety symptoms, somatic symptoms and quality of life at 12 weeks and six months follow-up. The study also included an assessment of the working alliance after six and 12 weeks. Results The combination of psychotherapy with the web-based program was more effective than psychotherapy alone at 12 weeks, with medium between-group effect sizes on primary depressive symptoms (Cohen's d =.51) and small to medium between-group effect sizes on secondary outcomes (Cohen's d =.07.55). Furthermore, we did not observe negative side effects in the blended format, e.g., a lower working alliance than in psychotherapy alone. Limitations The study had a smaller than planned sample size and the dropout rate at follow-up was high. Conclusions This study provides first evidence that the use of a web-based program as an adjunctive tool in regular psychotherapy could be a promising option to consider in future treatment for depression.  2017 Elsevier B.V.

### Title: **Telemedicine-delivered treatment interventions for substance use disorders: A systematic review**
#### Authors: Lin L.A., Casteel D., Shigekawa E., Weyrich M.S., Roby D.H., McMenamin S.B.
#### Abstract: With increased negative impacts from opioid and other substance use disorders in the US, it is important for treatments to not only be effective, but also accessible to patients. Treatment delivery via telemedicine, specifically, the use of videoconferencing, which allows real time communication between a patient and a clinician at a distant site, has been shown to be an effective approach for increasing reach and access to treatments for mental health disorders and other chronic illnesses. This systematic review identified and summarized studies examining the effectiveness of telemedicine interventions to deliver treatment for patients with substance use disorders. Out of 841 manuscripts that met our search criteria, 13 studies met the inclusion criteria. Studies covered interventions for nicotine, alcohol and opioid use disorders. They varied widely in size, quality, and in the comparison groups examined. Studies examined both delivery of psychotherapy and medication treatments. Most studies suggested telemedicine interventions were associated with high patient satisfaction and are an effective alternative, especially when access to treatment is otherwise limited. However, there were substantial methodological limitations to the research conducted to date. Further studies are needed, including larger scale randomized studies that examine different models of telemedicine that can be integrated into existing healthcare delivery settings, to increase the use of effective treatments for patients with substance use disorders.  2019

### Title: **COVID-19 and mental health: A review of the existing literature**
#### Authors: Rajkumar R.P.
#### Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic is a major health crisis affecting several nations, with over 720,000 cases and 33,000 confirmed deaths reported to date. Such widespread outbreaks are associated with adverse mental health consequences. Keeping this in mind, existing literature on the COVID-19 outbreak pertinent to mental health was retrieved via a literature search of the PubMed database. Published articles were classified according to their overall themes and summarized. Preliminary evidence suggests that symptoms of anxiety and depression (1628%) and self-reported stress (8%) are common psychological reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic, and may be associated with disturbed sleep. A number of individual and structural variables moderate this risk. In planning services for such populations, both the needs of the concerned people and the necessary preventive guidelines must be taken into account. The available literature has emerged from only a few of the affected countries, and may not reflect the experience of persons living in other parts of the world. In conclusion, subsyndromal mental health problems are a common response to the COVID-19 pandemic. There is a need for more representative research from other affected countries, particularly in vulnerable populations.  2020 Elsevier B.V.
