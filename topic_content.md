0. **Forensic telepsychiatry in Portugal [Telepsiquiatria forense em Portugal]**
**Forens**ic Telepsychiatry has had growing usage in countries such as the USA and England in the last decade, due to ongoing development of technologies which allow a better access to mental health care in needed populations, and improve the outcome of technicians' work, while facing a more demanding performance of Mental Health facilities. In this article we make a revision of **literatur**e concerning applications** of Fo**rensic Telepsy chiatry, analyzing its potencial ities and limits in Portugal. **The liter**ature shows positi veevidence about efficiency, cost and acceptance, to both patients and doctors. On the other hand, several authors rise issues related to technical, **ethic**al and **legal** aspects, such as restrictions to its applica**tion i**n forensics; privacy, **confidenti**ality, safety, consent, diagnostic skills and professional resp**onsibi**lity. Forensic Telepsy chiatry has shown special utility in remote rural populations with poor access to mental health care, victims of domestic violence, victims of sexual abuse, minor inpatients in correctional facilities and convicts in prisons. It may improve exchange of information with **court**s and penitentiaries, and production of evidence through quick and efficacious auditing. It has also been used** in c**ourt** to co**mmunicate forensic reports concerning mental health patients, to clarify issues related to psychiatric **evalu**ations and testify in criminal an**d civ**il courts. Besi**des the l**iterature revision, three areas o**f appl**icability for Forensic Telepsy hiatry in Portugal are discussed in this article: **teleconfer**ence for experts- psychiatrists and psychologists- te**stify**ing in court sessions; psychiatric and psychologi**cal e**valuations thro**ugh teleco**nference; expert auditions through a hotline, designed to provide special**ized **support to courts- both for urgent guidance and clarification. The reflections and proposals included in this article aim to make way to empirical studies whic**h cou**ld evaluate the applicability of a m**ore wi**despread usage of Forensic Telepsychiatry in Portugal in the near future.  2011 CELOM. eid: 2-s2.0-84856017254
1. **The use of telepsychiatry within forensic practice: a literature review on the use of videolinka ten-year follow-up**
In the last decade, telepsychiatrythe use of telecommunications technologies to deliver psychiatric services from a distancehas been increasingly utilised in many areas of mental health care. Since the review by Khalifa and colleagues in 2007 the body of **literatur**e relevant to the **forens**ic applications of telepsychiatry has grown substantially, albeit not by much in the United Kingdom. In the current review, we aim to provide an update summary of **the liter**ature published since 2007 to determine the effectiveness and feasibility of increasing telepsychiatry utilisation** in fo**rensic practi**ce. The l**iterature reviewed provides some encouraging evidence that telepsychiatry is a reliable, effective and highly acceptable method for delivering mental health **care i**n forensic settings. There are also a number of papers that indicate the use of telepsychiatry may be cost effective for health providers in the longer term. Further research is required to consider the potential **legal** and **ethic**al implications of using teleps**ychiat**ry in forensic settings.  2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group. eid: 2-s2.0-85032664265
2. **Forensic Assessment via Videoconferencing: Issues and Practice Considerations**
**Forens**ic assessment videoconferencing (VC) is gradually gaining popularity am**ong fo**rensic mental health practitioners. Given the profound impacts of the characteristics o**f VC o**n forensic assessment destined for **court**s, knowledge of and familiarity with the salient features of the technology and its app**licati**on in forensic assessment is relevant so as to obviate any potential negative impact. The present study examines some issues as well as practice consideration**s that** may help forensic psychologists enh**ance t**he results of forensic assessments conducted with VC technology. Discussions and sugges**tions **on how to advance forensic assessment via VC are offered. Copyright  Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. eid: 2-s2.0-84930885227
3. **Teleconferencing model for forensic consultation, court testimony, and continuing education**
A medical center-based **forens**ic clinic that provides the necessary comprehensive consultation, continuing education, **court** testimony, and clinical services through an applied model of **teleconfer**encing applications is addressed. Telemedicine technology and services have gained the attention of both **legal** and clinical practitioners, examining trends and models of health care for underserved populations, and identifying where consultation with a team of professionals may benefit service providers in rural communities. The contribution offered herein provides an understanding of the history of the development of the clinic, a theoretical model that has been applied to a clini**cal fo**rensic program that employs telepsychiatry services, and the **ethic**al and malpractice liability issues confronted in us**ing teleco**nferencing services. This model is examined through a child and ado**lescen**t forensic **evalu**ation clinic. The goals of this model are offered, as are a number of applications within the broad spectrum of services utilizing telemedicine. Finally, changing patterns are addressed in clinically based health-care delivery for criminal justice, social se**rvices**, and forensic mental health.

4. **Satisfaction of forensic psychiatric patients with remote telepsychiatric evaluation**
The level of satisfaction with telepsychiatry **evalu**ations was determined in a sample of 43 **forens**ic psychiatric patient inmates in a large urban jail**. A fo**rensic psychiatrist interviewed 20 patients in person, the other 23 remotely via interactive video. Demographic characteristics, physical health status, and psychiatric symptom seventy on the Global Severity Index of the Brief Symptom Inventory were comparable in the two groups. Patient satisfaction with **the e**valuations was moderately high for patients in both groups, with no significant differences between them. eid: 2-s2.0-0033779721

0. **A resident-based telepsychiatry supervision pilot program in Liberia**
Worldwide, attention to mental disorders lags far behind the staggering morbidity attributed to them. In low-resource settings, the majority of people with serious mental illness go untreated, and a major reason for this treatment gap is the worldwide **shortag**e of mental health professionals. In Liberia, this shortfall has been addressed by training and licensing nurses, midwives, and physician assistants as mental health clinicians (MHCs) via an intensive 6-month training program. This column describes a pilot program **util**izing senior American psychiatry **resid**ents to provide remote posttraining **supervis**ion to the MHCs via live teleconferencing.  2019 American Psychiatric Association.

1. **A comparison of on-site and telepsychiatry supervision**
Telemedicine has been used in **rural** settings for more than 25 years to provide services for patients and educational opportunities for practitioners. There is little documentation in the literature about using telepsychiatry for **supervis**ing psychiatric nurse practitioners. This article discusses **the supe**rvision **experi**ences of two groups of psychiatric nurse practitioners. One group of four nurses met weekly with a psychiatrist on-site. The other group of four nurses, working in three different clinical locations in Maine, met via a two-way interactive television connection with a psychiatrist based in Boston, Massachusetts.

2. **Psychotherapy supervision conducted via videoconferencing: A qualitative study of users' experiences**
The 70 h of mandatory psychotherapy **supervis**ion for psychiatry **resid**ents in Norway is designed to develop insight into the therapeutic **relationship**. Essential in fulfilling the intentions of psychother**apy supe**rvision is, for example, the ability to openly express and **util**ize personal **experi**ences, emotions, and reactio**ns. Six **supervision pairs - six candida**tes and **two supervisors - participated in a study to evaluate the **qualit**y of th**e psycho**therapy super**vision p**rocess when supervisors and candidates communicate by means of interactive audiovisual videoconferencing (VC). Each candida**te and t**heir respective sup**ervisors** participated in 10 supervised sessions, with 5 VC-based and 5 face-to-face sessions alternating every other session weekly. The part of the study reported in this article is based** on qu**alitative interviews conducted at the conclusion of the 60 sessions. The article concludes th**at the q**uality of psychotherapy supervision can be satisfactorily maintained by using VC (384 kbit/sec) for up to 50% of** the 70 **h of required psychotherapy supervision. The prerequisite for this estimate is that the pair in question has met face-to-face and establishe**d a relation**ship characterized by mutual trust and respect. The study further indicates that the limitations imposed by VC may, paradoxically enough, stimulate the development of insights and communication abilities that contribute pos**itively ****to th**e quality of psychotherapy supervision, also in a face-to-face setting. The most obvious implications of the study are the potentials provided by new technology for implementing decentralized models for recruiting and educating psychiatrists. eid: 2-s2.0-0031751739
3. **Training psychiatric residents and fellows in a telepsychiatry clinic: A supervision model**
Objectives: The authors assess the effectiveness of a specialized telepsychiatry training and **supervis**ion training model. Methods: Fifteen **resid**ents and eight child fellows rotated through Cedars Sinai Medical Center Telepsychiatry Developmental Disability Clinic and completed questionnaires of knowledge and self-assessed skills at commencement and completion of the rotation. **The supe**rvision was on site, side-by-side, and directive. Results: Both **the r**esidents and the fellows demonstrated improvement. Increase in knowledge was equal in the study cohorts**, whi**le residents' self-assessed skills were significantly greater than the fellows'. Conclusion: A telepsychiatry clinic appears to be an appropriate setting in which to provide** direct **supervision. Exposure to such opportunities early in training may yield a greater impact.

4. **Psychotherapy supervision face-to-face and by videoconferencing: A comparative study**
A **Shortag**e in qualified psychotherapy **supervis**ors in **rural** Norway motivated a study evaluating the **qualit**y of **the supe**rvision proce**ss when **supervisors and trainees communicated by interactive audiovisual videoconferencing (VC). Six **trainee **and supervisor pairs participated in five alternating VC based and face-to-face sessions. The pairs had previously established a good face-to-face **relationship**. Self-report data of **the qu**ality of communication, the alliance and disturbing **elements** in the supervision sessions were collected from specially designed questionnaires completed after each session. Independent ratings of the videotaped sessi**ons an**d qualitative interviews conducted at the end of the study were also conducted. The only significant difference between the two conditions was that trainees scored higher on disturbing factors under VC conditions. Recommendations for use of VC are provided in light of the findings. eid: 2-s2.0-0032776019

As a pioneer of training in the field of psychology, the Veterans Affairs (VA) HealthCare **System** serves as a leader in the training in and **provis**ion of Telemental Health (TMH) services in the United States. To meet goals toward continued expansion of these services, the VA TMH training program includes both web-based didactic courses and a skills competency test at a basic level with supervision and consultation in TMH for more advanced training and is available to **staff** psychologists and psychologist trainees. Despite these efforts, barriers for training in and implementation of TMH occur at the provid**er, sy**stem, and patient level. At the national level, the VA is actively working to resolve these barriers and we share site-specific examples implemented by the VA Puget Sound Heal**th Car**e System promoting access through TMH team to further address barriers to training and implementation.  2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-85085358844
1. **An integrated telehealth system for remote administration of an adult autism assessment**
We developed a telehealth **system** to administer an autism assessment **remot**ely. **The r**emote assessm**ent sy**stem integrates videoconferencing, stimuli presentation, recording, image and video presentation, and electronic assessment scoring into an intuitive software platform. This is an advancement over existing technologies used in telemental health, which currently require several devices. The **number** of children, adolescents, and adults with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) has increased dramatically over the past 20 years and is expected to continue to increase in coming years. In **gener**al, there are not many clinicians trained in either the diagnosis or treatment of adults with ASD. Given **the nu**mber of adults with autism in **need,** a remote ass**essmen**t system can potentially provide a solution to the lack of trained clinicians. The goal is **to ma**ke the remote** asses**sment system as close to face-to-face assessment as possible, yet versatile enough to **support** deployment in underserved areas. The primary challenge to achieving this goal is that the assessment requires social interaction that appears natural and fl**uid****, so t**he remote system needs to be able** to sup**port fluid natural interaction. For this study we developed compon**ents to** support this type of interaction and integrated thes**e comp**onents into a system** capabl**e of supporting the entire autistic assessment protocol. **We the**n implemented t**he sys**tem and evaluated the system on real patients. The results suggest that we have ac**hieved** our goal in developing a system with high-quality interaction that is easy to use.  Copyright 2013, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2013. eid: 2-s2.0-84891640994
2. **Interactive television for an urban adult mental health service: The Guy's psychiatric intensive care unit telepsychiatry project**
We carried out a feasibility study of an interactive **televis**ion (IATV) **system** to enhance the **provis**ion of psychiatric intensive care services to a **remot**e adult acute psychiatric ward in the same National Health Service mental health trust. **The sy**stem used videoconferencing equipment connected by ISDN at 128 kbit**/s. Th**e system was used for patient referral, assessment and monitoring by **staff** at **the r**emote site 8 km away. eid: 2-s2.0-0033651820
3. **Integrating Interactive Television-based psychiatric consultation into an urban community mental health service**
We conducted a pilot study of urban telepsychiatry employing interactive **televis**ion (IATV) over ISDN links for psychiatric consultation to **support** a primary-care mental health team. During the six months of the pilot phase, 30 consultations were arranged by the **gener**al practitioners for 14 different patients. Of these, 24 were completed by IATV and one by telephone when the IATV link failed. The **system** was used to manage patients with complex problems, many of whom were difficult to engage in standard services. The results showed high levels of user acceptance. Various problems for the further implementation of s**uch sy**stems were also identified. eid: 2-s2.0-0032607819
4. **An Evaluation of the Use of Interactive Television in an Acute Psychiatric Service**
This study reports the results of the use of a low-cost videoconferencing **system** (LCVC) for communication in an acute psychiatric service. Qualitative research methodology was used to examine the use of the LCVC in interactions between psychiatrists, patients and nursing **staff**, including information on refusals. One hundred and five clinical interactions were studied over four months. The LCVC proved technically reliable and compatible with the performance of a wide range of clinical tasks. However, the results suggest the need for better understanding of the nature and origins of the attitudes that users bring to the use of such communications technology. A framework is presented for the classification of user responses in terms of preexisting attitudes of the users, technological limitations of **the sy**stem and the mental state of the users. The study demonstrated the potential for interactive **televis**ion to **support** many of the communication tasks necessary in a dispersed psychiatric service and for telepsychiatry to become a major method of service **provis**ion.  1995, SAGE Publications.

The author describes an interactive **televis**ion (IATV) **system** set up between Massachusetts **Gener**al Hospital and a medical station in Boston. **The sy**stem has proven to be feasible and acceptable to individuals and institutions in the community, providing psychiatric skills on a much wider scale, in a more accessible way, and faster than an**y othe**r system. The author delineates the implications and future uses that appropriately placed IATV links could have, such as significantly multiplying existing manpower and more evenly distributing psychiatric care without placing greater demands on manpower. eid: 2-s2.0-0015874955
6. **Telepsychiatry: Psychiatric consultation through two-way television. A controlled study**
Telepsychiatry (consultation carried out through 2-way interactive **televis**ion) has been the object of a **number** of trials in the past twenty years, but to our knowledge there is no previous control study which compares CCTV and face-to-face intreviews. Various aspects of the interviews carried out on CCTV were rated on a 5-point scale in questionnaires filled out by: patients; consultees and; consultants. No significant difference was elicited with control interviews in respect to patients' diagnosis, age and sex. CCTV interview ratings by consultee and consultant were rated only slightly below those of the control group. Such findings should encourage a broader application of interactive CCTV, particularly as a complement to live consultations in distant areas. eid: 2-s2.0-0022618461

0. **Videoconferencing in a mental health service in The Netherlands: A randomized controlled trial on patient satisfaction and clinical outcomes for outpatients with severe mental illness**
Introduction: The goal of the study was to determinate if there was added value in the use of videoconferencing (VCF) in outpatient care for people with severe mental illness (SMI). Methods: A VCF-group was compared to a control group (care as usual) over a **period** of 18 months. Block randomization was used to assign patients to one of the two groups. The video communication was available to the patients on a 24/7 basis, so that emergency calls could also be made via VCF. The primary outcome was patient **satisfact**ion, other outcomes were: quality of life, loneliness, daily functioning (psychologically and socially), and the fulfilment of needs of care. Eventually, 93 patients signed their informed consent and participated. Results: For the primary outcome a statistically significant time by treatment interaction effect was found, where higher degree** of satis**faction was associated with the patients in the VCF-group. The secondary outcomes revealed no differences between the two groups. Despite the participants not using the VCF units extensively during the project, they were reasonably satisfied with VCF; on average, they rated the service with a 7.5 grade (on a scale from 110). Discussion: Although the study showed a positive result for **patient s**atisfaction, overall the VCF seemed to have limited impact. So VCF might not offer much added value to care as usual. However, statistical power in this study dropped somewhat due to dropout. Furthermore, VCF usage was lower than expected. Assuming that VCF will be most effective if it is actually used, it seems likely that the actual effect-size reached in this study has been significantly lower than the anticipated effect-size. Finally, this study shows that VCF is a tool that can be used in the care for people with severe mental illness.  2016,  The Author(s) 2016. eid: 2-s2.0-85020199870
1. **Interventions Developed for Psychiatric and Behavioral Treatment in the Childrens ADHD Telemental Health Treatment Study**
Telemental health (TMH) is one approach to rectifying geographic disparity in access to evidence-based mental health treatment for ADHD. We describe a brief (6-session) intervention for the TMH delivery of medication treatment with psychoeducation and Caregiver Behavioral Training to families of children with ADHD from underserved communities. Information on family engagement, **satisfact**ion, and fidelity to intervention protocols are presented. Overall, both parts of the intervention were well-received by families who engaged with the treatment, who learned information and skills, and who indicated very high levels** of satis**faction with treatment, even though it was relatively brief in nature. **Mean** rat**ings of s**atisfaction for the combined ADHD treatment was 38 (range=2740) out of a possible **total** score of 40 on** the Clie**nt Satisfaction Questionnaire. Both telepsychiatrists and therapists were highly faithful to the intervention protocols, as demonstrated by their independently-rated fidelity. Telepsychiatrists adhered to the intervention protocol with 91.69.5% reliability, and therapists adhered to their intervention protocol with 94.3% (SD: 9.7%) reliability This brief stabilization model of intervention is particularly relevant to working with a remote population where treatment resources are scarce. This study demonstrates that it is possible to provide direct psychiatric and behavioral services through telepsychiatry and to train and supervise therapists remotely.  2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York. eid: 2-s2.0-84939889835
2. **Satisfaction with long-distance motivational interviewing for problem drinking**
OBJECTIVES: To examine the relationship between participant preference and **satisfact**ion with live interactive video, telephone, or face-to-face motivational interviewing sessions with problem drinkers. METHODS: Participants complete**d a satis**faction questionnaire after each motivational interviewing counseling session utilizing an abbreviated Likert scale. The participants were asked what mode they would have preferred**, their s**atisfaction with their counselor**, and the**ir satisfaction with overall counseling. RESULTS: When asked to choose a long-distance mode of communication, televideo was preferred more than 2:1 over telephone. Also those with televideo experience were significantly more likely to choose televideo as a preferred long-distance mode of choice. CONCLUSIONS: Findings support the acceptability of 2 forms of long-distance communication, telephone and televideo, which might reasonably be studied in the future in rural areas (with some preference for televideo) to reduce heavy drinking and alcohol-related problems.  2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-33947185640
3. **International telepsychiatry: A study of patient acceptability**
An international telepsychiatry service was established between Denmark and Sweden for cross-cultural patient groups, such as asylum seekers, refugees and migrants. Over an 18-month **period** starting in mid 2006, 30 patients were treated by telepsychiatry (21 men and 9 women). The patients received mental health care by videoconferencing from providers who spoke the patients' own language, i.e. without the assistance of interpreters. The **total** number of telepsychiatry sessions was 203 (range 1-22; average 6.8 sessions per patient). Patients completed a **satisfact**ion questionnaire at the end of treatment. Seven patients (23%) were not able to complete a questionnaire, due to illiteracy and/or a psychotic condition. The rest of the patients (n=23) reported a high level of acceptance **and satis**faction with telepsychiatry, as well as a willingness to use it again or recommend it to others. Any disadvantages of telemedicine were compensated by the fact that the doctor and patient spoke the same language and had similar cultural and/or national references. Mentally ill asylum seekers, refugees and migrants are under-served in their mother tongue and telepsychiatry can improve access to scarce health-care resources. eid: 2-s2.0-64549119584
4. **Psychiatrists' satisfaction with telepsychiatry**
The purpose of this evaluation study was to learn more about psychiatrists' **satisfact**ion with telepsychiatry. Telepsychiatry will succeed only if psychiatrists are satisfied with this service delivery method and offer it to their patients. While telepsychiatry appears to be effective and most patients report that they are satisfied with it, less information is available about factors that lead to psychiatris**ts' satis**faction. We interviewed psychiatrists who treat rural/frontier patients and asked them to describe factors that encouraged or discouraged their use of telepsychiatry. Only 4 were mostly satisfied with telepsychiatry and all offered suggestions for improving this delivery method. Most agreed that it was a hardship for many of their patients to travel 100 to 750 roundtrip miles over a 1-3 day **period** for a 20-minute consultation and that telepsychiatry could be a lifeline to many of them. Nevertheless, they identified significant technical and interpersonal barriers that discouraged their use of telepsychiatry.  Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-33847757200
5. **Client acceptability and quality of life - telepsychiatry compared to in-person consultation**
We evaluated **client** **satisfact**ion and one-month mental health outcomes for telepsychia**try cl**ients compared with those undergoing a face-to-face psychiatric consul**tation**. Clients were asked to complete an SF-12 health survey before the consultation**, a satis**faction survey after the consultation, and were contacted for a one-month follow-up SF-12 survey by telephone. Forty-eight of the 62 initial responders (77%) were available for contact by telephone after one month. Tel**epsych**iatry clients demonstrated significant improvements on pre- and post-SF-12 mental health measures (t = 3.7; P = 0.001), while there was no change for the in-person group (t = 1.0; P = 0.35).** Telep**sychiatry clients felt that they could present the same information as in person(93%), were satisfied with their session (96%), and were comfortable in their ability to talk (85%); this was simil**ar to **the in-person clients. They reflected slightly lower le**vels of s**atisfaction regarding feeling supported and encouraged** than **did the in-person c**lients**. Both telepsychiatry clients and trad**itiona**l face-to-face psychiatry clients were satisfied with their experience of mental health care service provision, and mental health improvements were evident in the telepsychiatry patients. eid: 2-s2.0-33750686738
6. **The use of telepsychiatry in the brief counselling of non-psychotic patients from an inner-London general practice**
Brief counselling of 13 non-psychotic patients was carried out using an interactive television link, in order to assess patient **satisfact**ion with this technique. Informed consent was obtained from all patients before the videoconferencing sessions, which were conducted at 128 kbit/s. Over the four-month study **period**, 11 men and two women participated in a **total** of 29 sessions**. A t**otal of 28 questionnaires were completed. After the sessions, 93% of patients agreed that they would like to use this medium for communication again, 75% stated that they were able to see everything that they needed to see and 86% agreed that they were able to hear everything they needed to hear. Overall, these findings indicate that patients were happy with the standard of care they received. eid: 2-s2.0-2842511204
7. **Client satisfaction in a feasibility study comparing face-to-face interviews with telepsychiatry**
We carried out a pilot study comparing **satisfact**ion levels between psychiatric patients seen **face to fac**e (FTF) and those seen via videoconference. Patients who consented were randomly assigned to one of two groups. One group received services in person (FTF from the visiting psychiatrist) while the other was seen using videoconferencing at 128 kbit/s. One psychiatrist provided all the FTF and videoconferencing assessment and follow-up visits. A **total** of 24 subjects were recruited. Three of the subjects (13%) did not attend their appointments and two subjects in each group were lost to follow-up. Thus there were nine in the FTF group and eight in the videoconferencing group. The two groups were similar in most respects. Pati**ent satis**faction with the services was assessed using the** **Client** S**atisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8), completed four months after the initial consultation. The **mean** scores were 25.3 in the FTF group and 21.6 in the videoconferencing group. Although there was a trend in favour of the FTF service, the difference was not significa**nt. Patie**nt satisfaction is only one component of evaluation. The efficacy of telepsychiatry must also be measured relative to that of conventional, FTF care before policy makers can decide how extensively telepsychiatry should be implemented.  2002, Royal Society of Medicine Press Limited.

8. **Disagreement in satisfaction between patients and providers in the use of videoconferences by depressed adults**
Aim: To evaluate whether there was a difference in **satisfact**ion scores between providers and patients in the use of videoconferences (VCs) by depressed adults. Method: This study was a subanalysis of the joint European project, MasterMind, and participants were recruited from 15 pilot studies in 11 different countries. The Cli**ent Satis**faction Questionnaire (CSQ)-3 was used as assessment tool, and scores were summed to give **total** scores. The questionnaire consists of three items evaluating **general s**atisfaction, fulfillment of needs in treatment, and usability. Results**: A t**otal of 362 respondents, 201 patients and 161 providers, completed the questionnaire. Providers had** a me**an total CSQ-3 score of 9.17 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 8.90-9.45), whereas patients had a **mean** of 9.70 (95% CI = 9.44-9.9**8). **Mean scores for item 1 (the extent to which VCs had met the needs of the participants): Patients 3.19, providers 2.93 (p = 0.00048); for item** 2 (gener**al satisfaction): Patients 3.22, providers 3.08 (p = 0.083); and item 3 (whether participants wanted to use VCs again): Patients 3.28 providers 3.16 (p = 0.045). Conclusion: The results sh****owed **that** total satisfaction scores were higher in patients than in providers. The differences between patients and providers were significant for items 1 and 3 (p < 0.05), but we did not find a significant difference regarding item 2.  2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-85084654748

0. **Supporting carers of people with dementia: What is effective?**
Carer stress is well documented, especially in those caring for individuals with **dementia**. A recommendation of all natio**nal deme**ntia strategies is to provide excellent support and information to informal carers of peop**le with **dementia. NICE guidance suggests that a range of tailored interventions, including psychological input, psychoeducation and training courses, should be offered to reduce caregiver burden and stress, although good-quality outcome-based evidence is lacking. On the basis of a narrative review of the literature, we describe individual and multicomponent carer support packages and discuss their evidence base, reflecting on outcomes for carers. Multicomponent interventions have the best evidence for effectiveness.  The Royal College of Psychiatrists 2017. eid: 2-s2.0-85018790738
1. **Treatment of Behavior Disturbances with Ketamine in a Patient Diagnosed with Major Neurocognitive Disorder**
A 77-year-old woman who had been previously diagnosed with a major neuro**cognit**ive disorder became highly agitated and aggressive in a long-term care facility. She did not respond to intramuscular (IM) haloperidol plus lorazepam and had to be transported to the local emergency department (ED). In the ambulance, she remained highly agitated and was given 200 mg IM ketamine. Within minutes of receiving this, she de-escalated dramatically with no apparent adverse effects and remained stable for several days. Although ketamine has been used recently in pre-hospital settings and EDs to reduce agitated **behavior**, there has been little if any investigation of its potential for reduc**ing beha**vior disturbances in patients who suffer from major n**euroco**gnitive disorders. Ketamine could potentially be a promising treatment option for this population, but more research is needed.  2018 eid: 2-s2.0-85044665275
2. **Cognitive assessment of patients with Alzheimer's disease by telemedicine: Pilot study**
Background: Approximately 46.8 million people are living with **dementia** worldwide and their number will grow in the next years. Any potential treatment should be administered as early as possible because it is important to provide an early **cognit**ive assessment and to regularly monitor the mental function of patients. Information and communication technologies can be helpful to reach and follow patients without displacing them, but there may be doubts about the reliability** of co**gnitive tests performed by telemedicine. Objective: The purpose of this study was to **evalu**ate the reliability of the Mini Mental State **Examin**ation (MMSE) and the Alzheimer's Disease Assessmen**t Scal**e cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog) tests administered in hospital by videoconference to patients with **mild** to moderate Alzheimer's disease. Methods: The tests were administered to 28 Alzheimer's disease outpatients (8 male, mean age 73.88, SD 7.45 years; 20 female mean age 76.00, SD 5.40 years) recruited and followed in the Alzheimer's Unit of the A Cardarelli National Hospital (Naples, Italy) at **baselin**e and after 6, 12, 18, and 24 months of observation. Patients w**ere e**valuated first face-to-face by a psychologist and then, after 2 weeks, by another psychologist via videoconference in hospital. Results: This study showed no differences in the MMSE and ADAS-cog scores when the tests were administered face-to-face or by videoconference, except in patients with more** prono**unced cognitive deficits (MMSE<17), in which the assessment via videoconference ov**eresti**mated the cognitive impairment (face to face, MMSE mean 13.9, SD 4.9 and ADAS-cog mean 9.0, SD 3.8; videoconference, MMSE mean 42.8, SD 12.5 and ADAS-cog mean 56.9, SD 5.5). Conclusions: We found that videoconferencing is a reliable a**pproac**h to document cognitive stability or decline, and to measure treatment effects in patients w**ith **mild to moder**ate deme**ntia. A more extended study is needed to confirm these results.  Anna Carotenuto, Raffaele Rea, Enea Traini, Giovanna Ricci, Angiola Maria Fasanaro, Francesco Amenta. eid: 2-s2.0-85047544251
3. **Program evaluation of a telepsychiatry service for older adults connecting a university-affiliated geriatric center to a rural psychogeriatric outreach service in Northwest Ontario, Canada**
ABSTRACT Background: Weekly telepsychiatry consultations have been provided since 2002 to six communities in Northwest Ontario. Staff from a single community psycho**geriatr**ic outreach service who work within these communities facilitate the referrals. Methods: The program **evalu**ation included (a) a chart review of the last 100 referrals, (b) analysis of patient and st**aff e**valuations, (c) a survey mailed to all physicians in referring communities, and (d) three focus groups of staff working in local community agencies. Results: The mean age at the time of consultation was 76.7 years. Sixty-eight percent of patients were females. The most frequent diagnoses were **dementia** (54%), **depress**ion (28%), and **mild** **cognit**ive impairment (19%). The most frequent medication recommendations were **antidep**ressants or cholinesterase inhibitors. Two hundred ninety-four patient assessments and case consultations were carried out between 2002 and 2009. Post-**sessi**on evaluation surveys rated the provision of information, whether objectives were met, and overall usefulness of recommendations. The mean scores for these questions on a 5-point scale were between 4.6 and 4.85. Referring physicians were confident and satisfied with the recommendations made for their patients. All planned to continue to use telepsychiatry as a care option for the future. The focus groups added useful information about challenges and potential barriers to utilizing the program. Conclusions: The program was rated as being highly valued across all mo**dalit**ies of evaluation. Members of the referring team believe that access t**o a ger**iatric psychiatrist has broadened the team's knowledge base, its use of assessment tools, and increased their ability to better construct their patients' treatment plans.

4. **ECHO-AGE: An Innovative Model of Geriatric Care for Long-Term Care Residents With Dementia and Behavioral Issues**
Objectives: To design, implement, and assess the pilot phase of an innovative, remote case-based video-consultation program called ECHO-AGE that links experts in the management of **behavior** disorders in patients with **dementia** to nursing home care providers. Design: Pilot study involving surveying of participating long-term care sites regarding utility of recommendations and resident outcomes. Setting: Eleven long-term care sites in Massachusetts and Maine. Participants: An interprofessional specialty team at a tertiary care center and staff from 11 long-term care sites. Intervention: Long-term care sites presented challenging cases regarding residents w**ith deme**ntia and/or delirium rela**ted beha**vioral issues to specialists via video-conferencing. Methods: **Baselin**e resident characteristics and follow-up data regarding compliance with ECHO-AGE recommendations, resident improvement, hospitalization, and mortality were collected from the long-term care sites. Results: Forty-seven residents, with a mean age of 82years, were presented during the ECHO-AGE pilot period. Eighty-three percent of residents had a his**tory of **dementia and 44% were taking antipsychotic medications. The most common reasons for presentation were agitation, intrusiveness, and pa**ranoia. **Behavioral plans were recommended in 72.3% of patients. Suggestions for medication adjustments were also frequent. ECHO-AGE recommendations were completely or partially followed in 88.6% of residents. When recommendations were followed, sites were much more likely to report clinical improvement (74% vs 20%, P<.03). Hospitalization was also less common among residents for whom recommendations were followed. Conclusions: The results suggest that a case-based video-consultation program can be successful in improving the care of **elders w**ith dementia and/or delir**ium rela**ted behavioral issues by linking specialists with long-term care providers.  2014. eid: 2-s2.0-84912534512
5. **Telepsychiatry consultations to a rural nursing facility: A 2-year experience**
This report describes the operation of a telepsychiatry consultation service provided from an academic medical center to a skilled nursing facility in a rural setting. Seventy-one consultations via low-cost ISDN videoconferencing equipment were provided over the 2-year period to 40 patients. The average duration of the consultation period was about 3 months. A wide variety of diagnostic conditions were encountered, with the majority being either **depress**ion or **dementia**-related **behavior** problems. Advantages of the program included the ability to respond promptly to rural patients' clinical needs, the flexibility to consult more frequently if clinically indicated, and more efficient use of the consultant's time, as travel time was eliminated. The program is an example of how telepsychiatry can successfully expand access to mental health services to residents of long-term care facilities. eid: 2-s2.0-0034978061
6. **Identifying undiagnosed dementia in residential care veterans: Comparing telemedicine to in-person clinical examination**
Background: **Dementia** is a common but frequently undiagnosed problem in aging. Barriers to early diagnosis include a lack of routine screening **for deme**ntia and a lack of access to specialty consultative services. We conducted a pilot study to see if telemedicine could provide reliable, accurate **geriatr**ic consultative services to **evalu**ate patie**nts for **dementia who were residing at remote sites. Methods: This was a prospective cohort study that compared the diagnostic reliability of telemedicine to an in-person exam**ination **for dementia. Eligible subjects were residents of a Washington State Veterans' Home, age 60 years or older, with no pri**or diagn**osis of dementia. Eligible subject**s were s**creened for dementia using the 7-Minute Screen. Veterans who screened positive and consented to participate in the study received an in-person neuropsychiat**ric e**valuation at **baselin**e, and then both telemedicine and in-**person e**xaminations for dementia conducted by experien**ced ger**iatric psychiatrists. The accuracy of the telemedicine diagnosis was estimated by comparing it to the diagnosis from the clinical **examin**ation**. Three** geriatric psychiatrists who were blinded to the results of the clini**cal ex**amination conducted the telemedicine and in**-perso**n examinations. We also assessed attitudes of the s**ubjects** and geriatric psychiatrists towards the telemedicine sessions. Results: Eighteen of 85 subjects s**creened **were 'positive' for dementia on the 7 Minute Screen. Of these, 16 consented to participate in the telemedicine study. Twelve of the 16 subjects w**ere subs**equently diagnosed with dementia by the t**elemed**icine examination. The telemedicine diagnoses were in 100% agreement with the diagnoses from the in-**person** clinical examinations. Moreover, the subjects reported a high degree of satisfaction with the telemedicine experience and that they would like to have further care through telemedicine in **the fut**ure. The geriatric psychiatrists reported technical difficulties with the audio-visual quality of telemedicine in the initial phases of the project that resolved as familiarity with the telemedicine equipment increased. None of these problems had an adverse impact on the diagnostic accuracy of telemedicine. Conclusions: We found that telemedicine was as accurate as an** in-pe**rson clinical examinati**on in es**tablishing the diagnosis of dementia. In addition, subjects reported a high degree of satisfaction with telemedicine and a willingness to participate in telemedicine clinical care in the future. Given the large increase in the aging population **and the** shortage of geriatric psychiatrists nationally, it appears that telemedicine may be a promising means to exp**and the** availability of geriatric psychiatric consultation to remote areas.

7. **A videophone psychosocial intervention for dementia caregivers**
Background/Objectives: Available services and intervention programs for **dementia** caregivers are often underutilized because of issues such as cost, logistics, lack of knowledge about available services, or insufficient support from others. Information technologies offer the potential of removing these barriers and facilitating the ability of caregivers to access needed support. This project **evalu**ated the feasibility and efficacy of technologybased psychosocial intervention among minority family caregivers** of deme**ntia patients. Design: A feasibility and efficacy trial. Setting: Participants' homes in the Greater Miami Community. Participants: One hundred ten (56 Hispanic American and 54 African American) caregivers of patien**ts with **dementia. Intervention: A technologybased multi-component psychosocial intervention was delivered in-home and via videophone technology over 5 months. The intervention wasmodeled after the REACH II intervention and targeted known areas of caregiver risk. Measurement: Standardized measures of **depress**ion, caregiver burden, social support, and the caregivers' perception of the caregiver's experience were administered at **baselin**e and 5 months postrandomization. Results: Overall, caregivers who received the intervention reported a decrease in burden, an increase in perceived social support and positive perceptions of the caregiving experience. No effect was observed **for dep**ression. Most participants indicated that the intervention improved their caregiving skills and found the technology to be easy to use. Conclusions: A technology-based format was feasible for delivering a multi-component intervention to mino**rity fam**ily dementia caregivers. The intervention improved caregiver outcomes for both Hispanic and African American caregivers. The results suggest that technology may help eliminate disparities in access to caregiver intervention programs.  2013 American Association for **Geriatr**ic Psychiatry. eid: 2-s2.0-84888644123
8. **Cognitive intervention for community-dwelling older persons with memory problems: Telemedicine versus face-to-face treatment**
Background: Memory complaints and decline in **cognit**ive function are common in the eleder**ly. Co**gnitive intervention has been shown to be beneficial in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, few communit**y-base**d cognitive intervention programs are available in Hong Kong. The aim of this project is to **examin**e and compare the feasibility, acceptability, and clinical o**utcome** of a cognitive intervention program for older pat**ients **with **mild** cognitive impairment **and **mild **dementia** using telemedicine versus a conventional face-to-face method. Methods: Community-dwelling older subjects with m**ild** deme******ntia** or mild cognitive impairments were recruited from a community center. A total of 12 ses**sions **of assessment and cognitive intervention were conducted via videoconferencing or by face-to-face method. Assessment included: Cantonese version of Mini Mental St**ate Ex**amination (C-MMSE), Cantonese version of Rivermead Behavioural Memory test (C-RBMT) and Hie**rarchic **Dementia Scale (HDS). Results: Twenty-two clients were recruited. There was** signi**ficant and comparable cognitive improvement in clients in both treatment arms. The videoconference arm was highly accepted by the clients and the community center. Overall compliance rate of participants was above 95%. Conclusions: Telemedicine was a feasible, effective an**d acce**ptable means in providing cognitive assessment and inte**rventi**on to older p**erso**ns with mild cognitive deficits. Promoting such a program to other community settings would further enhance the acces**sibility** of dementia service to the community. Copyright  2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. eid: 2-s2.0-15344348363

0. **Use of Reimbursed Psychology Videoconference Services in Australia After Their Introduction: An Investigation Using Administrative Data**
Background: In November 2017, the Australian government approved reimbursement for psychology consultations conducted by **videoconfer**ence under the Better Access initiative to address inequitable access of mental health services across regions in Australia. Objective: This project uses publically available activity data from the Medicare Benefits Scheme to quantify the uptake** of videoco**nference for psychology resulting from the initiative change. Methods: Data were extracted from the Medicare Benefits Schedule item reports using the item codes for **standard** consultations and the new item co**des for vid**eoconference consultations. Activity data from 2 years before and the **first** year of the change to the Better Access initiative were compared to examine th**e uptake of** videoconference for psychology. Data were stratified by allied health profession, sex, age and state jurisdiction. Results: In the 1-year period after the introductio**n of reimbu**rsed videoconference consultations, approximately 5.7 million in-person con**sultations **and 4141 videoconference consultations were funded by** Medicare i**n Australia. Videoconference consultations comprised 0.07% of the total consultations performed in that 1-year period and showed an increased trajectory. The results can guide future research into **evalu**ating the clinical outcomes of pati**ents via bo**th in-person and videoconferen**ce delivery** modes. Conclusions: Videoconference mental health services were used in **the f**irst year that they were available, although they only accounted for a small percentage of all mental health consultations provided by allied health professionals. This finding lays the foundation for future work which could examine the effectiveness of the scheme in reducing inequity and investigating the economic benefits of the expanded initiative to the government and society.  2019 ISPORThe professional society for health economics and outcomes research eid: 2-s2.0-85073756466
1. **The SAGES telephone neuropsychological battery: correlation with in-person measures**
Objective: **Neuropsycholog**ical **test** batteries are administered in person to assess cognitive function in both clinical and research settings. However, in-person administration holds a number of logistical challenges that makes it difficult to use in large or remote populations or for multiple serial assessments over time. The purpose of this descriptive study was to determine whether a telephone-administe**red neuropsych**ologi**cal **test battery correlated well with in**-per**son testing. Methods: Fifty English-speaking patients without dementia, over 70 years old, and part of a cohort of patients in a prospective cohort study examining cognitive outcomes following elective surgery were enrolled in this study. Five well-va**lidated neurop**s**ycho**logical tests were administered by telephone to each participant by a trained interviewer within 24 weeks of the most recent in-pe**rson** interview. Tests included the Hopk**ins **Verbal Learning Test-Revised, Digit Span, Category Fluency, Phonemic Flu**ency**, and Boston Naming Test. A General Cognitive Performance composite score was ca**lcul**ated from individual subtest scores as a Z-score. Results: Mean age was 74.9 years (SD = 4.1), 66% female, and 4% non-White. Mean and interquartile distributions of telephone scores were similar to in-person **scor**es. Correlation **analysi**s of test scores revealed significant correlations between telephone and in-pe**rson** results for each individual subtest, as well as for the overall composite score. A BlandAltman plot revealed **no b**ias or trends in scoring for either test administration type. Conclusions: In this descriptive study, the te**leph**one v**ersion of a ne**uropsychological test battery correlated well with the in-person version and may provide a feasible supplement in clinical and research applications.

2. **The validation of a telepresence scale for psychotherapy delivered in videoconference**
The Telepresence in **Videoconfer**ence Scale (TVS) was developed and **test**ed over several years, but its psychometric properties have not been formally documented. The aim of this study was to examine the reliability and factor structure of the TVS. A total of 157 participants completed the scale followin**g a videoco**nference session with a psychotherapist delivered over four clinical trials. The TVS was submitted to an exploratory factor **analysi**s using the Principal Components method and a Varimax rotation. Three factors were found: Physical Presence, Interaction, and Absorption. Inter-item correlations and Cronbachs alpha were conducted to measure the internal consistency of the scale. Discriminant **valid**ity and converg**ent v**alidity were assessed with the Immersive Tendencies Questionnaire and the Distance Communication Comfort Scale. The results suggest that this revised version of the Telepres**ence in Vid**eoconference Scale is a relia**ble a**nd valid tool to measure clients sense of presence during psychotherapy sessions del**ivered over** videoconference technologies. Future research could examine whether this scale may be used in different contexts and with different populations.  2018, Interactive Media Institute. All rights reserved. eid: 2-s2.0-85067878343
3. **Telepresence experienced in videoconference varies according to emotions involved in videoconference sessions.**
Previous studies have linked telepresence to the strength of the therapeutic relationship experienced during telepsychotherapy. This finding comes as a surprise for many people who have been involved in a teleconference meeting, where telepresence is often considered weak. The aim of this study is to (re)**evalu**ate the impact of emotional engagement on telepresence. Participants were randomly assigned to one of the two conditions: (a) emotionally charged verbal exchange **first** (followed by a more neutral verbal exchange), or (b) emotionally neutral verbal excha**nge f**irst (followed by an emotionally charged verbal exchange). A distraction task was performed between the two verbal exchanges in **videoconfer**ence. Results showed that verbal exchanges involving stronger emotions increase telepresence. These results may explain why telepresence is so high in telepsychotherapy. eid: 2-s2.0-80054108479

Introduction. - Delivering psychotherapy by **videoconfer**ence could considerably extend the accessibilityof empirically **valid**ated treatments.Objective. - The aim of this study was to **evalu**ate the efficacy of a cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT)for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), administered **via videoco**nference.Method. - Five participants with a primary diagnosis of GAD took part in an experimental multiple baselinecase study protocol. The efficacy of the treatment **was e**valuated using a semi-structured interview,self-report questionnaires, and daily self-monitoring diaries.Results. - The results demonstrate that overall, participants' conditions were improved following treat-ment and they no longer met the diagnostic criteria for GAD in the short-term. Participants' conditionsimproved clinically and statistically at each follow-up point, achieving a greater global level of functioningat post-**test**, as well as at 3-month and 12-month follow-up.Conclusion. - Clinical implications of this new treatment modality and directions for future research arediscussed.  2014 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS. eid: 2-s2.0-84921044648
5. **A Flexible and Integrated System for the Remote Acquisition of Neuropsychological Data in Stroke Research**
Background: **Neuropsycholog**ical **test**ing is a central aspect of stroke research because it provides critical information about the cognitive-behavioral status of stroke survivors, as well as the diagnosis and treatment of stroke-related disorders. Stand**ard neuropsych**ological methods rely upon face-to-face interactions between a patient and researcher, which creates geographic and logistical barriers that impede research progress and treatment advances. Introduction: To overcome these barriers, we created a flexible and integrated system for the remote acquisi**tion of neurop**sychological data (RAND). The system we developed has a secure architecture that permits collaborative **videoconfer**encing. The system supports shared audiovisual feeds that can provide continuous virtual interaction between a participant and researcher throughou**t a **testing session. Shared presentation and computing controls can be used to deliver auditory and** vis**ual test items adapted from **standard** face-to-face materials or execute computer-based assessments. Spoken and manual responses can be acquired, and the components of the session can be recorded for offline data **analysi**s. Materials and Methods: To **evalu**ate its feasibility, our RAND system was used to administer a spee**ch-l**anguage test battery to 16 stroke survivors with a variety of communication, sensory, and motor impairments. The sessions were initiated virtually without prior face-to-face instruction in the RAN**D te**chnology or test batter**y. Results: Ne**uropsychological data were successfully acquired from all participants, including those with limited technology experience, and those with a communication, sensory, or motor impairment. Furthermore, participants indicated a high level of satisfaction with the RAND system and the remote assessment that it permits. Conclusions: The results indicate the feasibility of using the RAND system for vir**tual home-base**d neuropsychological assessment without prior face-to-face contact between a participant and researcher. Because our RAND system architecture uses off-the-shelf technology and software, it can be duplicated without specialized expertise or equipment. In sum, our RAND system offers a readily available and promising alternat**ive to face-to**-face neuropsychological assessment in stroke research.

7. **Videoconference-based mini mental state examination: A validation study**
Background: **Neuropsycholog**ical **test**ing is a prime criterion of good practice to document cognitive deficits in a rapidly aging population. Telecommunication technologies may overcome limitations related** to **test administration. We compared performance of the Italian **videoconfer**ence-based version of the Mini Mental State Examination (VMMSE) with performance of the **standard** MMSE administered face-to-face (F2F), to **valid**ate the Italian version of the 28-item VMMSE. Materials and Methods:** To v**alidate the Italian version of the VMMSE, we compared its performance w**ith stan**dard F2F. The sample (n=342) was administered three VMMSEs within 6 weeks af**ter **F2F testing. We identified the optimal cutoff through the receiver operating characteristic curve, as well as the VMMSE consistency through inter- and intrarater reliability (Inter/RR and Intra/RR) **analysi**s. Results: We found high levels of sensitivity and specificity for the optimal VMMSE cutoff identification and an accuracy of 0.96 (95% confidence interval 0.94-0.98). Intra/RR and inter/RR were highly significant. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that VMM**SE is** a valid instrument in clinical and research screening and monitoring of subjects affected by cognitive disorders. This study shows a significant correlation betw**een videoco**nference assessment and the F2F one, providing an important impetus to expand studies and the knowledge about the usefulness of tele-assistance services.

8. **A Pilot Trial of Neuropsychological Evaluations Conducted via Telemedicine in the Veterans Health Administration**
Introduction: Many veterans live in rural areas distant from Veterans Affairs Medical Centers (VAMCs) and receive primary medical care from community-based outpatient clinics (CBOCs). These veterans often must travel great distances to the nearest VAMC for **neuropsycholog**ical **evalu**ations, resulting in poor access to care, travel reimbursement costs, fee-ba**sis e**valuations of uncontrolled quality, and driving safety concerns. Return trips for feedback compound complications. Accordingly, we initiated a pilot trial** of neuropsych**o**logic**al evaluation and feedback via telemedicine (i.e., clinical **videoconfer**encing). Subjects and Methods: Participants were veterans refer**red for neurop**s**ychol**ogical evaluation from a rural CBOC 115 miles from the regional VAMC. All veterans were given the ch**oice **to undergo evaluation at the CBOC via telemedicine or in-person at the VAMC. Telemedicine equipment allowed presentation of digitized material with simultaneous patient observation. **Test**ing materials were organized in numbered folders and given to veterans by CBOC clerks i**mmedi**ately prior to evaluation. Clerks returned completed materials via facsimile. Results: Fifteen veterans from the rural CBOC we**re seen f**or ne****uropsychological evaluatio**n. Ei**ght chose telemedic**ine e**valuation. Groups based on evaluation modality appeared similar on demographics, referral basis, resulting neuropsychiatric diagnoses, and follow-through on recommendations. No significant technical or clinical difficulties were encountered, and veterans reported satisfaction with telemedicine. All veterans requested feedback via telemedicin**e**. Con**clusions**: Neuropsychological evaluation via telemedicine is feasi**ble a**nd appears comparable to in-person evaluation. Experiences are encouraging and consistent with the broader literature on the acceptance of and satisfaction with clini**cal videoco**nferencing. Future studies will assess possible psychometric issues in clinical populations.  Copyright 2012, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2012. eid: 2-s2.0-84869001703
9. **Factors influencing mental health providers intention to use telepsychotherapy in First Nations communities**
Telemental health is the use of information and communications technologies and broadband networks to deliver mental health services and support wellness. Although numerous studies have demonstrated the efficiency and utility of telemental health, certain barriers may impede its implementation, including the attitudes of mental health service providers. The current study draws on the technology acceptance model (TAM) to understand the role of mental health service providers attitudes and perceptions of telemental health (psychotherapy delivered via **videoconfer**encing) on their intention to use this technology with their patients. A sample of 205 broadly defined mental health service providers working on 32 **First** Nations reserves in the province of Quebec completed the questionnaire adapted to assess TAM for telepsychotherapy. Confirmatory factor **analysi**s and structural equation modeling provided evidence for the factor **valid**ity and reliability of the TAM in this sample. The key predictor of the intention to use telepsychotherapy was not mental health providers attitude toward telepsychotherapy, nor how much they expected this service to be complicated to use, but essentially how useful they expect it to be for th**eir F**irst Nations patients. If telemental health **via videoco**nferencing is to be impleme**nted **in First Nations communities, it is essential to thoroughly demonstrate its utility to mental health providers. Perceived usefulness will have a positive impact on attitudes toward this technology, and perceived ease of use will positively influence perceived usefulness. Cultural issues specific to the populations receiving telemental health services may be more efficiently addressed from the angle of perceived usefulness.  2013, SAGE Publications.

10. **Teleneuropsychology: Evidence for video teleconference-based neuropsychological assessment**
The use of **videoconfer**ence technology to deliver health care diagnostics and treatment continues to grow at a rapid pace. Telepsychiatry and telepsychology applications are well-accepted by patients and providers, and both diagnostic and treatment outcomes have generally been similar to traditional face-to-face interactions. Preliminary applications** of videoco**nference-based **neuropsycholog**ical assessment (**teleneuropsych**ology) have yielded promising results in the feasibility and reliability of several **standard** **test**s, although large-scale studies are lacking. This investigation was conducted to determine the reliability of video teleconference (VTC) **- based neurop**sychological assessment using a brief battery ****of stan**dard ne**uropsychologi**cal **tests commonly used in the **evalu**ation of known or suspected de**ment**ia. Tests included the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Hopkins Verb**al L**earning Test-Revised, Digit Span forward and backward, short for**m Bo**ston Naming Test, Letter and Category Fluency,** and** Clock Drawing. Tests were administered via VTC and in-person to subjects, counterb**alan**ced using alternate test fo**rms and **standard instructions. Two hund**red **two adult subjects were tested in both rural and urban settings, including 83 with cognitive impairment and 119 healthy controls. We found highly similar results across VTC and in-person conditions, with significant intraclass correlations (mean**=.74**; range: 0.55-0.91) between test scores. Findings remained consistent in subjects with or without cognitive impairment and in persons with MMSE scores as low a**s** 15.** VTC-base**d neuropsychological testing is a **valid** and **reliabl**e alternative to traditional face-to-face assessment using selected measures. **More** VTC-based studies using additional tests in different populations are need**ed t**o fully explore the utility of this new testing medium.

11. **Cognitive behavior therapy for panic disorder with agoraphobia in videoconference: Preliminary results**
Many studies have shown the feasibility of psychiatric consultation in telehealth, and some have addressed the effectiveness of telepsychotherapy. However, outcome studies on telepsychiatry essentially amount to a few case studies, none of which have used an empirically **valid**ated psychosocial treatment to treat a specific mental disorder. This article presents the preliminary results of an outcome study on the effectiveness of telepsychotherapy for panic disorder with agoraphobia. Participants received 12 sessions of cognitive-behavior therapy, which is an empirica**lly v**alidated treatment for panic disorder with agoraphobia. The treatment was delivered via **videoconfer**ence by trained therapists according to a **standard**ized treatment manual. The remote site was located at 130 km north of the local site and both were linked by six ISDN lines. Telepsychotherapy demonstrated statistically and clinically significant improvements on measures of target symptoms (frequency, of panic attacks, panic apprehension, severity of panic disorder, perceived self-efficacy) and measures of global functioning (trait anxiety, general improvement). Of interest was the fact that a very good therapeutic alliance was built after only the **first** telepsychotherapy session. Factors that may reduce the effectiveness of telepsychotherapy are discussed. eid: 2-s2.0-0034530048
12. **Randomized clinical trial of telepsychiatry through videoconference versus face-to-face conventional psychiatric treatment**
Although telepsychiatry in the form of **videoconfer**encing has been well received in terms of increasing access to care and user satisfaction, few data on treatment outcomes and efficacy from telepsychiatry applications are available at the present time. This paper **evalu**ates the efficacy of telepsychiatry thro**ugh videoco**nference in the treatment of mental disorders by comparing to face-to-face conventional (F2FC) treatment. We carried out a randomized clinical trial where 140 psychiatric outpatients were randomized to either F2FC treat**ment or vid**eoconference telepsychiatry (VCTP) treatment. Patients were diagnosed according to International Classification of Diseases, 10th edition (ICD-10) criteria using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Treatment involves eight consultations lasting 30 minutes over the 24-week study period. Patients received pertinent psychotropic medication plus cognitive-behavioral therapy during sessions. The same psychiatrist diagnosed and treated all the patients that were recruited from the Community Mental Health Centre of San Sebastian de la Gomera, in the Canary Islands. Change in psychiatric **test** scores served as the primary efficacy criterion. Efficacy was determined by comparing baseline (visit 1) Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness (CGI-S) and -Improvement (CGI-I) scales as well as Global Indexes (GSI, PSDI, and PST) from SCL-90R with scores obtained at the end of the study period (week 24). Response was defined as a CGI-I score of 1 or 2. **Reliabl**e Change Indexes were computed in SCL-90R Global Indexes scores. Of 140 patients randomized, 130 completed 24 weeks of treatment. Only 4 patients dropped out prematurely from the study in VCTP and 6 in F2FC. The study involves 534 teleconsultations, 522 F2FC consultations, and more than 500 hours of clinical practice. Significant improvements were found on the CGI and SCL-90-R Global Indexes scores of both treatment groups, showing clear clinical state improvement. No statistically significant differences were observed when the efficacy of VCTP treatment was compared to F2FC psychiatric treatment efficacy. This study demonstrated that telepsychiatry treatm**ent through** videoconference has equivalent efficacy to F2FC psychiatric treatment. Telepsychiatry showed to be an effective mean of delivering mental health services to psychiatric outpatients living in remote areas with limited resources.

13. **Assessing presence in videoconference telepsychotherapies: A complementary qualitative study on breaks in telepresence and intersubjectivity co-construction processes**
Assessing the efficacy of online psychotherapies is an important issue in eHealth. In the present research, we used an innovative approach to focus on the characteristics of breaks in interactions that impact the acceptance of the psychotherapy setting of a telepsychotherapy delivered in **videoconfer**ence. We also tried to build a method to assess if the level of telepresence in online interactions would be influenced by the acceptance of the psychotherapy setting. Sessions of psychotherapy delivered** in videoco**nference to two adults receiving CBT and two others receiving psychodynamic psychotherapy were analyzed to **test** the method. In this paper, we describe the methodology and illustrate preliminary results. An interactional grid was used to analyze verbal and non-verbal interactions, physical and social presence, and breaks in acceptance of the telepsychotherapy setting. This led to observe the interactional process of construction of enonciative co-presence, fundamental to allow people to experience intersubjectivity. This study is the **first** step towards a better understanding of the level of acceptance of the technological setting by patients and its influence on the interactions between them and psychologists.  2018, Interactive Media Institute.

0. **Self-management intervention for head and neck cancer couples: Results of a randomized pilot trial**
Background: Patients with head and neck **cancer** (HNC) **experi**ence significant physical and psychological morbidity during radiotherapy (RT) that contributes to treatment interruptions and a poor quality of **life**. Although spouses/partners can help by encouraging patient self-management (eg, self-care) during RT, they of**ten ex**perience high psychological **distress** rates, lack basic health care knowledge and skills, and report increased marital conflict regarding patient self-management. The current pilot study examined the feasibility and acceptability of a 6-session **telephon**e-based intervention called Spouses coping with the Head And neck Ra**diatio**n Experience (SHARE), which teaches self-management, communication, and coping skills to patients with HNC and their spouses. The treatment effects of SHARE compared with usual medical care (UMC) in controlling patient physical symptoms and improving patient/spouse psychological and marital functioning also were examined. Methods: Thirty patients who initiated RT and their spouses (60 participants; 40% of whom were racial/ethnic minorities) were randomized to SHARE or UMC, and preintervention and postintervention assessments were completed. Results: Solid recruitment (70%) and low attrition rates (7%) demonstrated feasibility. Strong program evaluations and homework completion rates (72%) **support**ed acceptability. Significant treatment effects (medium in magnitude) were observed for SHARE compared with UMC with regard to HNC-specific physical symptom burden (Cohens d, -0.89) and symptom interference (Cohens d, -0.86). Medium to large effects favoring SHARE also were found for patient and spouse **depress**ive symptoms (Cohens d, -0.84) **and ca**ncer-speci**fic dist**ress (Cohens d, -1.05). Conclusions: The findings of the current st**udy sup**port the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of SHARE. They also suggest that programs that empower HNC couples with the necessary skills to coordinate care and manage the challenges of RT together hold great promise for controlling a patients physical symptoms and improving the psychological functioning of both partners.  2018 A**merica**n Cancer Society eid: 2-s2.0-85058017264
1. **Reducing disparity in outcomes for immigrants with cancer: A qualitative assessment of the feasibility and acceptability of a culturally targeted telephone-based supportive care intervention**
Purpose: Australia has one of the most culturally diverse populations in the world. Immigrant **cancer** patients' poorer outcomes compared to English-speaking patients confirm the need for culturally sensitive **support**ive care interventions. The aims of this study were (1) to identify cultural sensitivities that are important to the acceptability of a **telephon**e-ba**sed sup**portive care intervention and (2) to identify cultural barriers and facilitators to intervention participation. Methods: Patients and carers attending Chinese or Ara**bic c**a**ncer** support groups were recruited. Two focus groups comprising 12 patients and 4 carers, and **two tele**phone interviews were conducted in the participants' own language. A semi-structured interview format was utilised to determine potential cultural sensitivities that may influence the intervention delivery format as well as patients' willingness to participate in tele**phone-b**ased supportive care interventions. Content analysis confirmed similar themes across groups. Results: The intervention was viewed favourably as a means of providing **informa**tion and support in the patient's language. Cultural considerations included assurances of confidential**ity, a**s cancer is not openly discussed within communities. An initial face-to-face contact was highlighted as the most important factor facilitating participation. Participants also recommended the inclusion of patient-initiated calls as part of the intervention. Conclusions: This study provides cultural insights relevant to the development of a culturally sensit**ive tel**ephone-based supportive care intervention for Arabic- and Chine**se-spe**aking **cancer pati**ents. Participants highlighted the need for face-to-face contact and inclusion of patient-initiated calls as important methodological considerations.  2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. eid: 2-s2.0-84879963882
2. **Tailored online cognitive behavioural therapy with or without therapist support calls to target psychological distress in adults receiving haemodialysis: A feasibility randomised controlled trial**
Background Psychological **distress** is prevalent in haemodialysis (HD) patients yet access to psychotherapy remains limited. This study assessed the feasibility and acceptability of online cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) tailored for HD patients, with or without therapist **support**, for managing psychologi**cal dist**ress. Methods This feasibility randomised controlled trial recruited patients from a UK HD centre. Following psycho**logical **distress screens, patients with mild-moderate ps**ychologi**cal distress (Patient Health Questionnaire PHQ-9; score: 519 and/or Generalised Anxiety Disorder; GAD-7 score: 514) who met remaining inclusion criteria were approached for consent. Consenters were individually randomised (1:1) to online-CBT or online-CBT plus three therap**ist sup**port calls. Outcomes included recruitment, retention, and adherence rates. Exploratory change analyses were performed for**: psycho**logical distress, quality of **life** (QoL), illness perceptions, and costs. The statistician was blinded to allocation. Results 182 (44%) out of 410 patients approached comp**leted ps**ychological distress screens. 26% found screening unacceptable; a further 30% found it un**feasible**. Psychological distress was detected in 101 (55%) patients, 60 of these met remaining inclusion criteria. The primary reason for ineligibility was poor computer literacy (N = 17, 53%). Twenty-five patients were randomised** to the** supported (N** = 18) **or unsupported arm (N = 7); 92% were retained at follow-up. No d**ifferenc**es in psychological distress or cost-effectiveness were observed. No trial adverse events occurred. Conclusion Online CBT appears feasible but only for computer literate patients who identi**fy with **the label psychological distress. A definitive trial using th**e curren**t methods for psychological distress screening and online care delivery is unfeasible.

3. **A new Australian online and phone mental health support service for Young People Living With Cancer**
Objective: The purpose of CanTeen's E-Mental Health Service for Young People Living With **Cancer** (YPLWC) is to meet the unique psychosocial needs of young people (12-24 years) in Australia impacted** by ca**ncer (either as a patient or family member of someo**ne wit**h cancer). Conclusions: This online platform will provide the primary site where all YPLWC can find information, connect with others going through a similar **experi**ence, express their feelings, utilise tools for **support** and access professional psychosoc**ial sup**port services that will meet their individual needs. The overall outcome of the service will be to ensure that the YPLWC visiting the s**ite ex**perience optimal psychological wellbeing. Ultimately, the service's value will be in improving the lives of young people who engage with it and the follow-on effect that this will have on their families and communities in the long-term.

4. **Ethical and Clinical Challenges Delivering Group-based Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy to Adolescents and Young Adults with Cancer Using Videoconferencing Technology**
Objective: Adolescents and young adults with **cancer** have poorer psychological outcomes relative to both younger and older patients. Their **distress** often peaks at the completion** of ca**ncer treatment, as they return to their normal lives while hospital-based **support** is reduced. Telepsychology has the potential to reduce help-seeking barriers in this group; nevertheless, other challenges remain. This article discusses the Recapture **Life** randomised controlled trial, which involved online, videoconferencing-based delivery of group-based cognitive-behavioural therapy to adolescents and young adults aged 15-25 years in the first year post-treatment. Methods: A case series (n=11, 53% females, mean age=21.1 years) is presented to illustrate ethical and clinical considerations in delivering cognitive-behavioural therapy in the online environment. Results: Across the study trajectory, ethical/clinical issues were documented among between 3.0-14.3% of participants. Almost half of the incidents (45%) were identified through routine safeguards built into the intake protocol. Challenges described include: (a) managing mental health risks without face-to-face contact; (b) facilitating discussion about potentially dist**ressin**g cancer-related **experi**ences in a group setting; (c) responding appropriately to participants' health cha**nges (**e.g., cancer relapse) during the trial; and (d) the need to be mindful of a range of 'survivorsh**ip' ex**periences and outlooks. Conclusions: We conclude by reflecting on the clinical 'trade-offs' that exist when the provision of therapy reliant on human interaction is transferred to an electronic realm. Despite the potential challenges, we argue that telepsychology is critical to broadening access to timely, evidence-based therapy among vulnerable groups, such as yo**ung pe**ople with cancer.  2015 The Australian Psychological Society. eid: 2-s2.0-84937551251
5. **Feasibility of brief psychological distress screening by a community-based telephone helpline for cancer patients and carers**
Background: Up to one-third of people affected by **cancer** **experi**ence ongoing psychological **distress** and would benefit from screening followed by an appropriate level of psychological intervention. This rarely occurs in routine clinical practice due to barriers such as lack of time **and ex**perience. This study investigated the feasibility of community-based **telephon**e helpline operators screening callers affected** by ca**ncer for their level** of dist**ress using a brief screenin**g tool (**Distress Thermometer), and triaging to the appropriate level of care using a tiered model.Methods: Cons**ecutiv**e **cancer pati**ents and carers who contacted the helpline from September-December 2006 (n = 341) were invited to participate. Routine screening and triage was conducted by helpline operators at this time. Additional socio-demographic and psychosocial adjustment data were collected** by tele**phone interview by research staff following the initial call.R**esults: **The Distress Thermometer had good overall accuracy in detecting general psychosocial morbidity (Hospital Anxiety and **Depress**ion Scale cut-off sco**re  15**) **for cancer **patients (AUC = 0.73) and carers (AUC = 0.70). We found 73% of parti**cipants **met the Distress Ther**mometer **cut-off for distress caseness according to the Hospital Anxiety **and Dep**ression Scale (a score  4), and optimal sensitivity (83%, 77%) and specificity (51%, 48%) were obtained with cut-offs of  4 and  6 in the patient and car**er group**s respectively. Distress was significantly associated with the Hospital Anxi**ety and** Depression Scale scores (total, as well as **anxiety** and depression subscales) and l**evel o**f **care in can**cer patients, as well as with the Hospi**tal Anx**iety and Depression Scale anxiety subscale for carers. There **was a tr**end for more highly distressed callers to be triaged to more int**ensive c**are, with patients with distress scores  4 more likely to receive extended or specialist care.Conclusions: Our data suggest that it was feasible **for co**mmunity-based cancer helpl**ine oper**ators to screen callers for dis**tress us**ing a brief screening tool, the Distress Thermometer, and to triage callers to an appropri**ate leve**l of care using a tiered model. The Distress Thermometer is a rapid and non-invasive alternative to longer psychometric instruments, a**nd may p**rovide part of the solution in ensuring distressed patients** and c**arers affected by cancer are identified and **support**ed appropriately.  2010 Hawkes et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd. eid: 2-s2.0-77349102059
6. **The Utility of Videoconferencing to Provide Innovative Delivery of Psychological Treatment for Rural Cancer Patients: Results of a Pilot Study**
The unmet psychological needs of rural **cancer** patients are numerous. Telepsychology is a novel and feasible option that may provide cost-savings and help overcome inequalities in access to specialists. This is the first known study of psychological treatment for people w**ith ca**ncer delivered entirely via videoconferencing. We hypothesized that a telepsychology service would improv**e rura**l **cancer pati**ents' anxiety and **depress**ion levels and quality of **life**, and would be an acceptable, satisfactory, and practical mode of service delivery. **Twenty**-f**ive cancer **patients attended an average of three sessions with a clinical psychologist providing brief cognitive-behavioral therapy. Questionnaires were completed at pre-, post-, and 1-month follow-up. Patients benefited in terms of anxiety (P = 0.01) and quality** of **life (P = 0.04). The service was both practical and acceptable. These preliminary positive results provide a firm basis to conduct a randomized controlled trial of face-to-face interaction vs. videoconferenc**ing.  **2006 U.S. Cancer Pain Relief Committee. eid: 2-s2.0-33750504036

0. **Rural Status, Suicide Ideation, and Telemental Health: Risk Assessment in a Clinical Sample**
Objective: Individuals living in rural areas die by **suicid**e at higher rates than those living in metropolitan areas. Telemental health interventions provide rural residing individuals with access to needed care. Identifying telemental health clients at **risk** **for su**icide is an important task for clinicians and policymakers. This study evaluated to what degree rural status and other demographic variables pr**edicte**d suicide **ideat**ion in clients seeking services at a telemental health clinic. Methods: Study participants included 457 low-income clients residing in the medically underserved, geographically diverse Brazos Valley region of Texas. Clients completed the patient health questionnaire during their initial counseling appointment, which assessed **depress**ion s**everit**y and suic**ide i**deation in the 2 weeks prior to asses**sment.** Results: **Suici**de ideation was common among telemental health clients, with approximately 40% of clients in all demographic groups reporting some** recen**t though**ts of **suicide. Rates** of s**uicide ideation did not significantly differ by geographic designation (ie, rural/metropolitan status), gender, or race/ethnicity. Howev**er, dep**ression was a** stron**g predictor of** rece**nt suicide ideation. Conclusions: Telemental health programs can effectively connect clinicians with rural residing clients who are otherwise isolated from health care services. However, clinicians working in high-need, historically underserved areas should be prepared to** encou**nter a high pr**evale**nce of suicide ideat**ion and** depression. In these regions, clinical and diagnostic f**eature**s may be bette**r ind**icators of suicide ideation than demographic variables.  2018 National Rural Health Association eid: 2-s2.0-85063445623
1. **Telepsychiatric assessment of a mariner expressing suicidal ideation**
This **case report** highlights the successful use of telepsychiatric consultation by secure video chat to remotely assess a mariner expressing **suicid**al **ideat**ion. As a result of this intervention, telemedicine providers initiated psychiatric stabilisation while the mariner was still aboard the vessel, determined that he was safe for repatriation under the care of qualified medical escorts, and facilitated admission to a psychiatric facility near his home in the United States. Mental health emergencies are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality among mariners. Telepsychiatry is a validated method of establishing a psychiatric diagnosis and disposition as well as assessing **risk**** of su**icidality and the potential for violent decompensation. It has the potential to be a valuable adjunct to any traditional maritime telemedicine service. eid: 2-s2.0-84949728257
2. **Novel Use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) to Predict Suicidal Ideation and Psychiatric Symptoms in a Text-Based Mental Health Intervention in Madrid**
Natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning were used to predict **suicid**al **ideat**ion and heightened psychiatric symptoms among adults recently discharged from psychiatric inpatient or emergency room settings in Madrid, Spain. Participants responded to structured mental and physical health instruments at multiple follow-up points. Outcome variables of interest w**ere su**ici**dal i**deation and psychiatric symptoms (GHQ-12). Predictor variables included structured items (e.g., relating to sleep and well-being) and responses to one unstructured question, "how do you feel today?" We compared NLP-based models using the unstructured question with logistic regression prediction models using structured data. The PPV, sensitivity, and specificity for NLP-based mo**dels o**f **suicidal id**eation were 0.61, 0.56, and 0.57, respectively, compared to 0.73, 0.76, and 0.62 of structured data-based models. The PPV, sensitivity, and specificity for NLP-based models of heightened psychiatric symptoms (GHQ-12  4) were 0.56, 0.59, and 0.60, respectively, compared to 0.79, 0.79, and 0.85 in structured models. NLP-based models were able to generate relatively high predictive values based solely on responses to a simple general mood question. These models have promise for rapidly identifying persons** at ri**sk of suicide or psychological distress and could provide a low-cost screening alternative in settings where lengthy structured item surveys are not feasible.  2016 Benjamin L.

3. **Staying well after depression: Trial design and protocol**
Background: **Depress**ion is often a chronic relapsing condition, with relapse rates of 50-80% in those who have b**een dep**ressed before. This is particularly problematic for those who become **suicid****al when** depressed since habitual recurrence** of su**icidal thoughts increases likelihood of furthe**r acut**e suicidal episodes. Therefore the question how to prevent relapse is of particular urgency in this group.Methods/Design: This trial compares Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT), a novel form of treatment combining mindfulness meditation and cognitive **therapy** for depression, with both Cognitive Psycho-Education (CPE), an equally plausible cognitive treatment but without meditation, and treatment as usual (TAU). It will test whether MBCT reduces the **risk** of relapse** in rec**urrently depressed patients and the i**nciden**ce of suicidal symptoms in those wi**th a h**istory of suicidality who do relapse. It recruits participants, screens them by telephone for main inclusion and exclusion criteria and, if they are eligible, invites them to a pre-treatment session to assess eligibility in more detail. This trial allocates eligible participants at random between MBCT and TAU, CPE and TAU, and TAU alone in a ratio of 2:2:1, strati**fied b**y presence of **suicidal id**eation or behavio**ur and **current anti-depressant use. We aim to recruit sufficient participants to allow for retention of 300 following attrition. We deliver both active treatments in groups meeting for two hours every week for eight weeks. We shall estimate effects **on rat**es of relapse and suicidal symptoms over 12 months following treatment and assess clinical status immediately after treatment, and three, six, nine and twelve months thereafter.Discussion: This will be the first trial of MBCT to investigate whether MCBT is effective i**n preve**nting relapse to depression when compared with a control psychological treatment of equal plausibility; and to explore the use of MBCT fo**r the m**ost severe recurrent depression **- that** in **people **who become suicidal when depressed.Trial Registration: Current Controlled Trials: ISRCTN97185214.  2010 Williams et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd. eid: 2-s2.0-77952283373
4. **Safety of telemental healthcare delivered to clinically unsupervised settings: A systematic review**
The safety of telemental healthcare delivered to clinically unsupervised settings, such as a personal residence, must be established to inform policy and further the dissemination of telemental health programs. The aim of this article is to provide an overview of safety issues associated with telemental healthcare and, through a systematic literature review, evaluate the safety of telemental healthcare delivered to unsupervised settings. The review resulted in a total of nine studies that specifically evaluated the delivery of telemental healthcare to unsupervised settings. Six of the nine studies reviewed explicitly described safety plans or specific precautions that could be used if necessary. Two of the nine studies reported events that required the researchers to use safety procedures to effectively respond to concerns they had regarding participant safety. In both of these studies, the issues were resolved with prescribed safety procedures. Recommendations and future directions for the development and evaluation of safety protocols are discussed.  2010, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-77956136277

Physicians and psychologists are often the front-line professionals who examine and treat individuals who are in **suicid**al crisis. Murphy comments "the clinical conditions that predispose** to su**icide frequently occasion visits to physicians, mostly nonpsychiatrists**." Whe**n suicide appears imminent, physicians and psychologists take the necessary steps to hospitalize the patient to ensure their safety.

We describe our safety protocol and how it was adapted from current recommended best practices, published guidelines, and local requirements for managing patient safety during home-based telepractice. We conclude with discussion of other key safety issues associated with telepractice.

0. **Telepsychotherapy for trichotillomania: A randomized controlled trial of ACT enhanced behavior therapy**
Despite its prevalence, quality treatment for trichotillomania is often difficult to find. The use of telepsychology has been an effective method for disseminating treatment services for a variety of mental health conditions. However, no research has examined the use of telepsychology to treat trichotillomania. This randomized controlled trial used Acceptance and **Commit**ment Therapy Enhanced Behavior Therapy delivered by way of telepsychology to treat trichotillomania in adults. The study compared an **act**ive treatment condition (n = 12) to a delayed treatment waitlist control condition (n = 10). Results showed significant reductions in hair pulling severity from pre- to post-treatment compared to the waitlist condition. The 22 participants all received treatment and were combined to examine overall treatment effects from pre-treatment to a 12-week follow-up. The effect of treatment on hair pulling severity remained significant at follow-up. Measures of psychological flexibility and perceived shame also saw significant improvement. Quality of **life**, however, did not improve over the course of treatment. The findings demonstrate that telepsychology is a viable option to disseminate treatment for trichotillomania.  2018 Elsevier Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-85046370384

Objective: This study evaluated a 4-week web-based Acceptance and **Commit**ment Therapy (**ACT**) mental health promotion intervention for **univers**ity students. Method: Participants were randomized to intervention (n = 596) or waitlist control (n = 566). Assessment of primary outcomes (depression, anxiety, stress, well-being, self-compassion, **life** sa**tis**faction, and academic performan**ce)** and ACT processes (acceptance, cognitive fusion, education values, valued living, and present moment awareness) occurred at pre- and post-intervention and 12-week follow-up for intervention participants, and the same prepost interval for waitlist control participants. Results: Analyses showed significant improvements from pre- to post-intervention compared with waitlist control on all primary o**utc**omes and ACT processes. All intervention gains were maintained at follow-up. Improvements on all primary outcomes were mediated b**y t**hree or more ACT processes in both **sampl**es.

Objective: This study evaluated a 4-week web-based acceptance and **commit**ment therapy (**ACT**) mental health promotion program called YOLO (You Only Live Once) for **univers**ity students. Method: A total of 130 participants were randomized to one of three intervention groups investigating varied program delivery methods. Primary outcomes assessed: depression, anxiety, stress, well-being, self-compassion, alcohol use, and **life** sa**tis**f**act**ion. ACT processes assessed: acceptance, cognitive fusion, education values, valued living, and mindfulness. Results: Improvement on the primary o**utc**omes and ACT processes did not differ among the three intervention groups.

All ACT processes mediated changes on one or more primary outcomes in the intent-to-treat **sampl**e. Intervention effects were consistent on mo**st **primary outcomes and ACT processes across th**ree s**ample groupings.

3. **Web-Based Self-Help for Preventing Mental Health Problems in Universities: Comparing Acceptance and Commitment Training to Mental Health Education**
Objective: This study sought to test the feasibility of a web-based Acceptance and **Commit**ment Training (**ACT**) prototype prevention program cal**led** ACT on Colleg**e L**ife (ACT-CL). Method: A **sampl**e of 234 **univers**ity students was randomized to** ei**ther the ACT-CL website or a mental health education (MHE) website. Results: Findings indicated a lower level of user engag**eme**nt and satisfaction ratings wi**th **the prototype of ACT-CL than the MHE website. There were no significant differences between conditions on outcome measures at post or follow-up. However, statistical trends sugg**est**ed the MHE condition actually led to greater remission **of **severe symptoms than the ACT-CL condition among those with severe symptoms at baseline. There were no di**ffe**rences between conditions on ACT process of change measures. Changes in psychological flexibility were predictive of changes in mental health across conditions, but relations dissipated over time. Furthermore, great**er **engagement in some components of ACT-CL predicted improvements in psychological flexibility, though not on mental health ou**tco**mes. Conclusions: The effects of the A**CT-**CL program on mental health outcomes and ACT process measures were largely equivalent to those of an education website, although the**re **was a lower level of program engagement with ACT-CL. Findings are discussed in the context of feasibility issues and lessons learned for program revisions.  2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-84958680658
4. **Guided and unguided Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for social anxiety disorder and/or panic disorder provided via the Internet and a smartphone application: A randomized controlled trial**
Acceptance and **Commit**ment Therapy (**ACT**) can be effective in treating anxiety disorders, yet there has been no study on Internet-delive**red** ACT for social anxiety disorder (SAD) and panic disorder (PD), nor any study investigating whether therapist guidance is superior to unguided self-help when supplemented with a smartphone application. In the current trial, n = 152 participants diagnosed with SAD and/or PD were randomized to therapist-guided or unguided treatment, or a waiting-list control group. Both treatment groups used an Internet-de**liv**ered ACT-based treatment program and a smartphone application. Outcome measures were self-rated general and social anxiety and panic symptoms. Treatment groups saw reduced general (d = 0.39) and social anxiety (d = 0.70), but not panic symptoms (d = 0.05) compared to the waiting-list group, yet no differences in outcomes were observed between guided and unguided interventions. We conclude that Interne**t-d**elivered ACT is appropriate for treating SAD and potentially PD. Smartphone applications may partially compensate for lack of therapist support.  2016 eid: 2-s2.0-84991059235
5. **Rural Assertive Community Treatment and Telepsychiatry**
Assertive community treatment (**ACT**) is an evidence-based treatment for patients with severe and persistent mental illne**ss.** ACT has been shown to reduce inpatient hospitalization and is increasingly being used as a mainstay of evidence-based psychi**atr**ic practice for these clinical populations. The increasing implementation of evide**nce**-based practices has led to t**he **expansion of ACT in rural areas. Variability i**n t**he adaptation of ACT in rural areas has included accommodation by teams to multiple barriers. One way to increase psychiatric professional efficiency in rural areas is with telepsychiatry **and** possibly with rural ACT, but with unknown effects on fidelity and outcomes. Telepsychiatry has been considered a means of expanding** th**e reach of and access to ACT. Concerns abo**ut **the use of telepsychiatry by ACT teams include the psychiatrist's ability to develop a relationship with patients and staff and difficulties observing the patient's entire living environment via telemedicine. The Piedmont Community Services Board (CSB) Program **for** Assertive Community Treatment (PACT) serves patients in southwestern Virginia in collaboration with the Virginia Tech Carilio**n S**chool of Medicine. The Piedmont CSB PACT uses telemedicine to expan**d t**he **tre**ating psychiatrist's reach and contact with PACT patient**s, **increasing the efficiency of the psychiatrist's PACT time. Telemedicine is used for crisis intervention and augmentation of regular ongoing visits. The goals of this project were to mea**sur**e patient, staff, and psychiatrist** co**mfort and satisfaction with the use of telepsychiatry in ACT in addition to monitoring routine outcome measures.  2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

0. **Telephone-adapted Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction (tMBSR) for patients awaiting kidney transplantation**
Background Patients with progressive kidney disease experience increasing physiologic and psychosocial **stress**ors and declining health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Methods We conducted a randomized, active-controlled, open-label trial to test whether a **Mind**fulness-ba**sed St**ress ****Reduc**t**ion (MBSR) program delivered in a **novel** workshop-teleconference format wo**uld r**educe symptoms and improve HRQOL in patients awaiting **kidney transplant**ation. Sixty-three transplant candidates were randomized to one of two arms: i) **telephon**e-adapted MBSR (tMBSR, an 8-week program of **medit**ation and yoga); or ii**) a tele**phone-based support group (tSupport). Participants completed self-report questionnaires at baseline, post-intervention, and after 6-months. Anxiety, measured by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) post-intervention served as the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included: depression, sleep quality, pain, fatigue, and HRQOL assessed by SF-12 Physical and Mental Component Summaries (PCS, MCS). Results 55 patients (age 54  12 yrs) attended their assigned program (tMBSR, n = 27; tSupport, n = 28). 49% of patients had elevated anxiety at baseline. Changes in anxiety were small and did not differ by treatment group post-intervention or at follow-up. However, tMBSR significantly improved mental HRQOL at follow-up: + 6.2 points on the MCS - twice the minimum clinically important difference (95% CI: 1.66 to 10.8, P = 0.01). A large percentage of tMBSR participants ( 90%) practi**ced **mindfulness and reported it help**ful fo**r stress management. Conclusions **Neit**her mindfulness training nor a support group resulted in clinically meaning**ful re**ductions in anxiety. In contrast, finding that tMBSR was more effective than tSupport for bolstering mental HRQOL during the wait fo**r a kidney transp**lant is encouraging and warrants further investigation.

1. **Telephone-adapted mindfulness-based stress reduction (tMBSR) for patients awaiting kidney transplantation: Trial design, rationale and feasibility**
**Mind**fulness-based **stress** ****reduc**t**ion (MBSR) has demonstrated benefits **for st**ress-related symptoms; however, for patients with burdensome treatment regimens, multiple co-morbidities and mobility impairment, time and travel requirements pose barriers to MBSR training. Purpose: To describe the design, rationale and feasibility results of Journeys to Wellness, a clinical trial** of **mindfulness training delivered in a **novel** workshop and teleconference format. The trial aim is** to r**educe symptoms and improve quality of life in people waiting for a **kidney transplant**. Methods: The standard 8-week MBSR program was reconfigured for delivery as two in-person workshops separated in time by six weekly teleconferences (tMBSR). A time and attention comparison condition (tSupport) was created using the workshop-**telephon**e format. Feasibility resul**ts: Kidney transp**lant candidates (N. =. 63) were randomly assigned to tMBSR or tSupport: 87% (n. =. 55) attended . 1 class, and for these, attendance was high (6.6. . 1.8 tMBSR and 7.0. . 1.4 tSupport sessions). Fidelity monitoring found that all treatment elements were delivered as planned and few technical problems occurred. Patients in both groups reported high treatment satisfaction, but more tMBSR (83%) than tSupport (43%) participants expected their intervention to be quite a bit or extremely useful for managing their health. Symptoms and quality of life outcomes collected before (baseline, 8. weeks and 6. months) an**d after kidney tr**ansplantation (2, 6 and 12. months) will be analyzed for efficacy. Conclusions: tMBSR is an accessible intervention that may be useful to people with a wide spectrum of health conditions. Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT01254214.  2015 Elsevier Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-84927592826
2. **Mindfulness training for smokers via web-based video instruction with phone support: A prospective observational study**
Background: Many smokers are unable to access effective behavioral smoking cessation therapies due to location, financial limitations, schedule, transportation issues or other reasons. We report results from a prospective observational study in which a promising **novel** behavioral intervention, **Mind**fulness Training for Smokers was provided via web-based video instruction with **telephon**e-based counseling support. Methods: Data were collected on 26 low socioeconomic status smokers. Participants were asked to watch eight video-based classes describ**ing **mindfulness skills and how to use these skills to overcome various core challenges in tobacco dependence. Participants received eight weekly phone calls from a smoking cessation coach who provided general support and answered questions about the videos. On the quit day, participants received two weeks of nicotine patches. Results: Participants were a mean of 40.5 years of age, smoked 16.31 cigarettes per day for 21.88 years, with a mean of 6.81 prior failed quit attempts. Participants completed a mean of 5.55 of 8 online video classes with a mean of 23.33 minutes per login, completed a mean of 3.19 of 8 phone coach calls, and reported a mean **medit**ation practice time of 12.17 minutes per day. Smoking abstinence was defined as self-reported abstinence on a smoking calendar with biochemical confirmation via carbon monoxide breath-test under 7 parts per million. Intent-to-treat **analysi**s demonstrated 7-day point prevalence smoking abstinence at 4 and 6-months post-quit of 23.1% and 15.4% respectively. Participants showed a significant pre- to post-intervention incr**ease** in mindfulness as measured by the **Five**-Factor Mindfulness Questionnaire, and a significant pre- to post-intervention decrease in the Anxiety Sub-scale of the Depression Anxiety and **Stress** Scale. Conclusions: Resul**ts s**uggest that Mindfulness Training for Smokers can be provided via web-based video instruction with phone support and yield reasonable participant engagement on intervention practices and that intervention efficacy and mechanism of effect deserve further study.

3. **Psychotherapy in 2022: A delphi poll on its future**
Repeating and expanding Delphi polls conducted during the past 30 years, the authors empaneled 70 psychotherapy experts to forecast psychotherapy trends in the next decade. **Mind**fulness, cognitive- behavioral, integrative, and multicultural theories were predicted to increase the most, whereas Jungian therapy, classical psycho**analysi**s, and transactio**nal ana**lysis were expected to decline the most. Technological, self-change, skill-building, and relationship-fostering interventions were judged to be in the ascendancy. Internet programs, **telephon**e therapy, and master's-level professionals were expected to flourish. Forecast scenarios with the highest likelihood centered on expansion of telepsychology, evidence-based practice, pharmacotherapy, and masters-degree practitioners flooding the job market. Four themes seem to be driving these changes: technology, economy, evidence, and ideas.  2013 American Psychological Association. eid: 2-s2.0-84887539621

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), **stress**-related chronic diseases are the main source of death in developed countries. During the last decade, e-mental health, telepsychology or telepsychiatry interventions are showing its growing potential due to the gradual global adoption of the internet and mobile phone technologies. A significant number of studies have concluded that **mind**fulness helps to **reduc**e physical and psychological symptoms** of st**ress related to various health concerns and that it is a psychological skill that can be trained. The purpose of this online research study is to gather the participants socio-demographics as **well a**s stress **and **mindfulness data during an** onl**ine mindfulness training program. Sustained attention and t**he s**tate of mindfulness experienced in single **medit**ation sessions are also tracked and stored. Correlational **analysi**s yielded to a statistically significant relationship between hig**h scor**es in stress an**d lo**w scores in mindfulness facets (p <.001) and between state a**nd t**rait aspects of mindfulness (p <.01).  2012 Interactive Media Institute. eid: 2-s2.0-85019601802

0. **A Promising New Strategy to Improve Treatment Outcomes for Patients with Depression**
Each year, ineffective medical management of patients with mental illness compromises the health and well-being of individuals, and also impacts communities and our society. A variety of interrelated factors have impeded the health system's ability to treat patients with **behavior** health conditions adequately. A key contributing factor is a lack of objective markers to help predict patient response to specific drugs that has led to patterns of "trial and error" prescribing. For many years, clinicians have sought objective data (eg, a laboratory or imaging test) to assist them in selecting appropriate treatments for individual patients. Electroencephalogram (EEG) findings coupled with medication outcomes data may provide a solution. "Crowdsourced" physician registries that reference clinical outcomes to individual patient physiology have been used successfully for cancers. These techniques are now being explored in the context** of beha**vioral health care. The Psychiatric EEG Evaluation Registry (PEER) is one such approach. PEER is a clinical phenotypic database comprising more than 11,000 baseline EEGs and more than 39,000 outcomes of medication treatment for a variety of mental health diagnoses. Collective findings from 45 studies (3130 patients) provide compelling evidence for PEER as a relatively simple, inexpensive predictor of likely patient response to specific antidepressants and likely treatment-related side effects (including suicidal ideation).

1. **Study to promote innovation in rural integrated telepsychiatry (SPIRIT): Rationale and design of a randomized comparative effectiveness trial of managing complex psychiatric disorders in rural primary care clinics**
Objective: Managing complex psychiatric disorders like PTSD and bipolar disorder is challenging in Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) delivering care to U.S residents living in underserved rural areas. This **protocol** paper describes SPIRIT, a pragmatic comparative effectiveness trial designed to compare two approaches to managing PTSD and bipolar disorder in FQHCs. Interventions: Treatment comparators are: 1) Telepsychiatry Collaborative Care, which integrates consulting telepsychiatrists into primary care teams, and 2) Telepsychiatry Enhanced Referral, where telepsychiatrists and telepsychologists treat patients directly. Methods: Because Telepsychiatry Enhanced Referral is an adaptive intervention, a Sequential, Multiple Assignment, Randomized Trial design is used. Twenty-four FQHC clinics without on-site psychiatrists or psychologists are participating in the trial. The sample is patients screening positive for PTSD and/or bipolar disorder who are not already engaged in pharmacotherapy with a mental health specialist. Intervention fidelity is measured but not controlled. Patient treatment engagement is measured but not required, and intent-to-treat analysis will be used. Survey questions measure treatment engagement and effectiveness. The Short-Form 12 Mental Health Component Summary (SF-12 MCS) is the primary outcome. Results: A third (34%) of those enrolled (n = 1004) are racial/ethnic minorities, 81% are not fully employed, 68% are Medicaid enrollees, 7% are uninsured, and 62% live in poverty. Mental health related quality of life (SF-12 MCS) is 2.5 standard deviations below the national mean. Discussion: We hypothesize that patients randomized to Telepsychiatry Collaborative Care will have better outcomes than those randomized to Telepsychiatry Enhanced Referral because a higher proportion will engage in evidence-based treatment.  2019 eid: 2-s2.0-85078769514
2. **Solving Mental Healthcare Access Problems in the Twenty-first Century**
Technology is the key to solving mental healthcare access problems in the twenty-first century. Perhaps the greatest challenge we face in harnessing the possibilities of information technology in healthcare today is to ensure that we do it in a manner that is clearly evidence-based. This means innovations must be evaluated in a variety of contexts, using designs to ensure they are feasible and acceptable to our patients, are effective in treating the symptoms and disorders for which they are applied, and ultimately are structured to have the best possible balance of increasing access, minimising costs, and maximising clinical outcomes. As a service delivery medium, telemedicine, or telepsychology, offers a viable means of delivering high quality, specialised mental health services to people with significant access-to-care barriers, such as those living in remote or rural areas, lacking in transportation, or experiencing ambulatory problems such as many elderly people do. Randomised controlled trials have demonstrated the clinical efficacy of telemedicine for specific populations with discrete psychiatric disorders. Going forward we must discover how to best integrate telemedicine with in-person care and other forms of communications technology, including the Internet, mobile technology and its "apps", social media, virtual reality, "smart homes," and wearable monitoring devices. It is also imperative that we better integrate these approaches with primary medical care so that "mental healthcare" does not continue to be viewed as independent from physical health.  2015 The Australian Psychological Society. eid: 2-s2.0-84937574068
3. **Online psycho-education to the treatment of bipolar disorder: Protocol of a randomized controlled trial**
Background: Bipolar disorder patients frequently present recurrent episodes and often experience subsyndromal symptoms, cognitive impairment and difficulties in functioning, with a low quality of life, illness relapses and recurrent hospitalization. Early diagnosis and appropriate intervention may play a role in preventing neuroprogression in this disorder. New technologies represent an opportunity to develop standardized psychological treatments using internet-based tools that overcome some of the limitations of face-to-face treatments, in that they are readily accessible and the timing of therapy can be tailored to user needs and availability. However, although many psychological programs are offered through the web and mobile devices for bipolar disorder, there is a lack of high quality evidence concerning their efficacy and effectiveness due to the great variability in measures and methodology used. Methods: This clinical trial is a simple-blind randomized trial within a European project to compare an internet-based intervention with treatment as usual. Bipolar disorder patients are to be included and randomly assigned to one of two groups: 1) the experimental group (tele-care support) and 2) the control group. Participants in both groups will be evaluated at baseline (pre-treatment) and post-treatment. Discussion: This study describes the design of a clinical trial based on psychoeducation intervention that may have a significant impact on both prognosis and treatment in bipolar disorder. Specifically, bringing different services together (service aggregation), it is hoped that the approach proposed will significantly increase the impact of information and communication technologies on access and adherence to treatment, quality of the service, patient safety, patient and professional satisfaction, and quality of life of patients.

4. **Guided Internet-Based Self-Help Intervention for Social Anxiety Disorder With Videoconferenced Therapist Support**
We describe the development of a novel, Internet-based, self-help intervention for social anxiety disorder (SAD) in adults, and report data on the preliminary efficacy of the program when administered with minimal therapist support delivered via a common videoconferencing platform. Participants (n=13) completed the intervention, which consists of 8 weekly modules and a brief weekly videoconferenced check-in with a therapist. The intervention program is derived from an acceptance-based **CBT** program that utilizes traditional **behavior**al interventions (e.g., exposure) within the context of a model emphasizing mindful awareness and psychological acceptance of distressing subjective experiences. Assessments revealed that participants experienced a significant reduction in SAD symptoms and improvements in psychosocial functioning, and that treatment gains were maintained over a 3-month follow-up period. The effect sizes for the main outcome measures were large to very large (d=0.90 to 1.47), and comparable to other Internet-based treatment programs as well as in-person trials for SAD (e.g., Feske & Chambless, 1995; Tulbure, 2011). Participants also rated the treatment program as highly acceptable. This pilot study provides preliminary evidence that an Internet-based intervention grounded in ba**sic beha**vioral and acceptance-based principles is effective for the treatment of SAD, and that videoconferenced therapist support may be useful in enhancing treatment compliance. Implications and future directions are discussed.  2016 eid: 2-s2.0-84944097655
5. **PHIT for duty, a mobile approach for psychological health intervention**
The goal of this effort is to support prevention of psychological health problems through innovation in mobile personal health assessment and self-help intervention (SHI). For the U.S. military, we are developing and evaluating a fielddeployable personalized application, PHIT for Duty, to help build resilience in healthy troops and support prevention in high-risk personnel. PHIT for Duty is delivered using any smartphone or tablet with optional nonintrusive physiological and **behavior**al sensors for health status monitoring. The application integrates a suite of health assessments with an intelligent advisor that recommends, tailors, and presents self-help advisories. PHIT for Duty is intended for secondary prevention of psychological health problems in persons who have been exposed to psychological trauma and may be showing some symptoms of distress, but have not been diagnosed with any psychological disease or disorder.  2012 Interactive Media Institute. eid: 2-s2.0-84872023701
6. **An internet-based self-help program for the treatment of fear of public speaking: A case study**
This article discusses the development of the first totally self-administered online **CBT** program for the treatment of a specific social phobia (fear of public speaking) called talk to me. The online program includes three parts. The assessment **protocol** gives the patient information about the problem, including impairment, severity, and the degree of fear and avoidance regarding the main feared situations. The structured treatm**ent prot**ocol ensures that the patient does not skip any steps in the treatment. The tr**eatment **protocol i**s a** CBT program that provides exposure to the feared situation using videos of real audiences. Finally, **the cont**rol protocol assesses treatment efficacy, not only at posttreatment, but also at every intermediate step.

7. **Predictors of dropout in face-to-face and internet-based cognitive-behavioral therapy for bulimia nervosa in a randomized controlled trial**
Objective: We sought to identify predictors and moderators of failure to engage (i.e., pretreatment attrition) and dropout in both Internet-based and traditional face-to-face cognitive-**behavior**al therapy (**CBT**) for bulimia nervosa. We also sought to determine if Internet-based treatment reduced failure to engage and dropout. Method: Participants (N=191, 98% female) were randomized to Internet-ba**sed**** **CBT (CBT4BN) or traditional face-to**-fa****c**e group CBT (CBTF2F). Sociodemographics, clinical history, eating disorder severity, comorbid psychopathology, health status and quality of life, personality and temperament, and treatment-related factors were investigated as predictors. Results: Failure to engage was associated with lower perceived treatment credibility and expectancy (odds ratio [OR]=0.91, 95% CI: 0.82, 0.97) and body mass index (BMI) (OR=1.10; 95% CI: 1.03, 1.18). Dropout was predicted by not having a college degree (hazard ratio [HR]=0.55; 95% CI: 0.37, 0.81), novelty seeking (HR=1.02; 95% CI: 1.**01,** 1.03), previous CBT experience (HR=1.77; 95% CI: 1.16, 2.71), and randomization to the individual's nonpreferred treatment format (HR=1.95, 95% CI: 1.28, 2.96). Discussion: Those most at risk of failure to engage had a higher BMI and perceived treatment as less credible and less likely to succeed. Dropout was associated with less education, higher no**vel**ty seeking, previous CBT experience, and a mismatch between preferred and assigned treatment. Contrary to e**xpe**ctations, Internet-based CBT did not reduce failure to engage or dropout.  2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.(Int J Eat Disord 2017; 50:569577).  2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-85006054976
8. **A pilot randomized controlled trial of videoconference-assisted treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder**
Evidence-based exposure and response prevention (ERP) treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is not always easily accessible. Long distances from specialist treatment and other practical or motivational difficulties can interfere with ERP access and outcome. Delivery of ERP through telepsychology can help "fill the gap". The current study included 30 patients with OCD who were randomized to 12 weeks of either videoconference-assisted ERP (VCT; N=10), self-help ERP (S-H, N=10), or a wait-list condition (W-L, N=10). The VCT format included use of tablet-based videoconferencing sessions (N=6) or studio-based videoconference (N=4), as well as telephone calls. Patients rated the VCT format as natural and reported strong working alliances with their therapists. VCT treatment produced significantly greater reductions in obsessive-compulsive symptoms compared to the two control conditions. **Treatment outcom**es were similar to that of regular face-to-face ERP and improvements in symptom scores remained stable at follow-up. The study indicated that ERP for OCD can be delivered efficiently with videoconferencing technology along with telephone calls. The use of such technology in psychological treatment is likely to become more common in the future and it holds promise as a method to make evidence-based treatment more accessible.  2014 Elsevier Ltd. eid: 2-s2.0-84909588326
9. **Telepsychology and Self-help: The Treatment of Fear of Public Speaking**
This work presents a self-help, Internet-based telepsychology program for the treatment of public speaking fears. The system is comprised of 3 parts: The assessment **protocol** gives the patient information about his or her problem (i.e., amount of interference it creates in his or her life, severity, degree of fear and avoidance). The system also includes a structured treatm**ent prot**ocol, organized into separate blocks, reflecting the patient's progress. This ensures that the patient does not skip any steps in the treatment (something quite common in traditional self-help manuals), which provides more control over the process. The tr**eatment **protocol is a cognitive-**behavior**al program that provides exposure to the feared situation using videos of real audiences. Finally, **the cont**rol protocol assesses treatment efficacy, not only at closure, but also at every intermediate step. Efficacy data from 12 social phobia patients are presented from pretreatment to posttreatment and at 1-month follow-up. These preliminary data support the efficacy of our telepsychology program for the treatment of fear of public speaking. This is a preliminary work in a promising research path that examines the possibility of using the Internet for the treatment of psychological disorders.  2006. eid: 2-s2.0-33846672733
10. **An open trial of videoconference-mediated exposure and ritual prevention for obsessive-compulsive disorder**
The gold-standard treatment for OCD is exposure and ritual prevention (ERP), yet despite its well-established efficacy, only a small percentage of OCD patients have access to this treatment. Remote treatments (e.g., videoconferencing) are becoming increasingly popular avenues for treatment delivery and show promise in increasing patient access to evidence-based mental health care. The current pilot study utilized an open trial to examine the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of videoconference-mediated, twice weekly, ERP for adults (n= 15) with OCD. Results revealed that ERP was associated with significant improvements in OCD symptoms and large within-group effect sizes. Among the 10 individuals who completed a 3-month follow-up assessment, 30% of participants no longer met DSM-IV-TR criteria for OCD and 80% of participants were rated as very much or much improved on the CGI. This study adds to the growing body of literature suggesting that videoconference-based interventions are viable alternatives to face-to-face treatment.  2014 Elsevier Ltd. eid: 2-s2.0-84901432153
11. **The STRATOB study: Design of a randomized controlled clinical trial of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Brief Strategic Therapy with telecare in patients with obesity and binge-eating disorder referred to residential nutritional rehabilitation**
Background: Overweight and obesity are linked with Binge Eating Disorder (BED). Effective interventions to significantly reduce weight, maintain weight loss and manage associated pathologies like BED are tipically combined treatment options (dietetic, nutritional, physical, **behavior**al, cognit**ive-beha**vioral, pharmacological, surgical). Significant difficulties with regard to availability, costs, treatment adherence and long-term efficacy are present. Particularly Co**gnitive **Behavioral Therapy (**CBT**) is the therapeutic approach indicated both in in-patient and in out-patient settings for BED. In recent years systemic and systemic-strategic psychotherapies have been implemented to treat patients with obesity and BED involved in familiar problems. Particularly a brief **protocol** for the systemic-strategic treatment of BED, using overall the strategic dialogue, has been recently developed. Moreover telemedicine, a new promising low cost method, has been used for obesity with BED in out-patient settings in order to avoid relapse after the in-patient step of treatment and to keep on a continuity of care with the involvement of the same clinical in-patient team.Methods: The comparison betw**een** CBT and Brief Strategic Therapy (BST) will be assessed in a two-arm randomized controlled clinical trial. Due to the novelty of the application of BST in BED treatment (no other RCTs including BST have been carried out), a pilot study will be carried out before conducting a large scale randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT**). **Both CBT and BST group will follow an in-hospital treatment (diet, physical activity, dietitian counseling, 8 psychological sessions) plus 8 out-patient telephone-based sessions of psychological support and monitoring with the same in-patient psychotherapists. Primary outcome measure of the randomized trial will be the change in the Global Index of the Outcome Questionnaire (OQ-45.2). Secondary outcome measures will be the percentage of BED patients remitted considering the number of weekly binge episodes and the weight loss. Data will be collected at baseline, at discharge from the hospital (c.a. 1 month after) and after 6-12-24 months from the end of the in-hospital treatment. Data at follow-up time points will be collected through tele-sessions.Discussion: The STRATOB (Systemic and STRATegic psychotherapy for OBesity), a comprehensive two-phase stepped down program enhanced by telepsychology for the medium-term treatment of obese people with BED seeking intervention for weight loss, will shed light about the comparison of the effectiveness of the BST with the go**ld **standard CBT and about the continuity of care at home using a low-level of telecare (mobile phones).Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01096251.  2011 Castelnuovo et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd. eid: 2-s2.0-79955686267
12. **Telepsychology and self-help: The treatment of phobias using the internet**
One of the challenges today in the research of psychological treatments based on evidence is their dissemination. **Efficaci**ous and effective psychological treatments should be available and accessible for both practitioners and consumers. However, only a small percentage of potential patients actively seek help for psychological problems that could be ameliorated by therapy. Internet-based self-help interventions may help to solve this problem by reducing the amount of actual contact between therapist and patient and by overcoming the geographical barriers that separate them. The aim of this work is to present a completely self-applied telepsychology program (Without Fear) to treat small animal phobia (spiders, cockroaches, and mice), which uses virtual reality scenarios for the exposure tasks. Preliminary data about the efficacy and effectiveness of this program in a series of 12 cases is offered. Participants showed an improvement in all clinical measures at posttreatment, and the therapeutic gains were maintained at a 3-month followup.  2008 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-57649119958
13. **The acceptability of an Internet-based self-help treatment for fear of public speaking**
Several randomised **controlled studi**es have shown the efficacy of Internet-based self-help treatments. These studies have centred their attention on axis I (efficacy) of the Guidelines for Empirically Validated Treatments, although there are a few studies that also take into account axis II (effectiveness). The aim of the present work was to test the acceptability of an Internet-based self-help program for fear of public speaking and to compare its acceptability with the same treatment administered by a therapist. Fifty-two participants suffering from social phobia were randomly selected to take part in one of these treatments. All participants reported being satisfied with the treatment received, and results did not show significant differences between both treatments. These outcomes were maintained at 12-month follow-ups.  2009 Taylor & Francis. eid: 2-s2.0-70449464721
14. **Cognitive-behavioral therapy attenuates nociceptive responding in patients with fibromyalgia: A pilot study**
Objective. To explore the possibility that cognitive - **behavior**al therapy (**CBT**) influences fibromyalgia symptoms via descending inhibition of nociception, we evaluated the effects** of** CBT on the nociceptive flexion reflex (NFR) threshold, an objective measure of spinal nociceptive transmission. Methods. Female fibromyalgia patients (n = 32) were randomized to 6 weekly sessions of telephone-de**liv**ered CBT or usual care (UC). Assessments of the NFR threshold and clinical outcomes were conducted at baseline, w**eek** 6 (post-CBT), and week 12. Results. From baseline to week 6, the NFR threshold i**ncr**eased in the CBT group and decreased in the UC group (mean  SD 4.4  13.7 mA versus -10.2  9.9 mA; P = 0.005). This difference was also apparent at week 12 (mean ** SD** 7.3  9.2 mA for CBT versus -5.4  13.5 mA for UC; P = 0.01). The groups reported similar reductions in NFR pain ratings at week 6 (m**ean**  SD -20.2  23.9 for CBT versus -14.9  16.4 for UC; P = 0.8) and week **12 **(mean  SD -8.9  25.3 for CBT versus -10.8  24.1 for UC; P = 0.4)**. C**onclusion. Compared with UC, CBT reduced nociceptive responding in fibromyalgia patients. Moreover, while the UC group exhibited longitudinal decreases in both the stimulation level and pain associated with** th**e NFR threshold, those receiving CBT required more intense stimulation to elicit the NFR as well as rated that stimulation as less painful than at baseline. These data indicate the need for a larger study to confirm that changes in nociceptive re**spo**nsivity may underlie the benefits of CBT in fibromyalgia patients.  2010, American College of Rheumatology. eid: 2-s2.0-77951724805
15. **Telemental health: A status update**
A rather large body of literature now exists on the use of telemental health services in the diagnosis and management of various psychiatric conditions. This review aims to provide an up-to-date assessment of telemental health, focusing on four main areas: computerized **CBT**** (**cCBT), Interne**t-b****as**ed CBT (iCBT), virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET), and mobile therapy (mTherapy). Four scientific databases were searched and, where possible, larger, better-designed meta-analyses and controlled trials were highlighted. Taken together, published studies support an expanded role for telepsychiatry tools, with advantages that include increased care access, enhanced efficiency, reduced stigma associated with visiting mental health clinics, and the ability to bypass diagnosis-specific obstacles to treatment, such as when social anxiety prevents a patient from leaving the house. Of technology-media**ted** t**her**apies, cCBT and iCBT possess the most efficacy evidence, with VRET and mTherapy representing promising but less researched options that have grown in parallel with virtual reality and mobile technology advances. Nonetheless, telepsychiatry remains challenging because of the need for specific computer skills, the difficulty in providing patients with a deep understanding or support, concerns about the "therapeutic alliance", privacy fears, and the well documented problem of patient attrition. Future studies should further test the efficacy, advantages and limitation**s o**f technology-enabled CBT, as well as explore the online delivery of other psychotherapeutic and psychopharmacological modalities.  2015 World Psychiatric Association. eid: 2-s2.0-84930432208
16. **Feasibility of popular m-health technologies for activity tracking among individuals with serious mental Illness**
Obesity prevalence is nearly double among individuals with serious mental illness (SMI), including schizophrenia spectrum disorders, bipolar disorder, or major depressive disorder, compared with the general population. Emerging mobile health (m-health) technologies are increasingly available and offer the potential to support lifestyle interventions targeting weight loss, yet the practical feasibility of using these technologies in this high-risk group has not been established. We evaluated the feasibility and acceptability of popular m-health technologies for activity tracking among overweight and obese individuals with SMI. We provided wearable activity monitoring devices (FitBit [San Francisco, CA] Zip or Nike Inc. [Beaverton, OR] FuelBand) and smartphones (Apple [Cupertino, CA] iPhone 4S) for accessing the smartphone application for each device to participants with SMI enrolled in a weight loss program. Feasibility of these devices was measured by the frequency of use over time. Acceptability was measured through qualitative follow-up interviews with participants. Ten participants with SMI wore the devices for a mean of 89% (standard deviation=13%) of the days in the study. Five participants wore the devices 100% of the time. Participants reported high satisfaction, stating the devices were easy to use, helpful for setting goals, motivational, and useful for self-monitoring. Several participants liked the social connectivity feature of the devices where they could see each other's progress on the smartphone application, noting that "friendly" competition increased motivation to be more physically active. This study supports using popular m-health technologies for activity tracking among individuals with SMI. These findings can inform the design of weight loss interventions targeting this vulnerable patient population.  Copyright 2015, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2015. eid: 2-s2.0-84924815083
17. **An internet-based self-help treatment for fear of public speaking: A controlled trial**
This study offers data about the efficacy of "Talk to Me," an Internet-based telepsychology program for the treatment of fear of public speaking that includes the most active components in cognitive-**behavior** therapy (**CBT**) for social phobia (exposure and **cognitive therapi**es). One hundred twenty-seven participants with social phobia were randomly assigned to three experimental conditions: (a) an Internet-based self-administered program; (b) the same program applied by a therapist; (c) a waiting-list control group. Results showed that both treatment conditions were equally **efficaci**ous. In addition, Talk to Me and the same treatment applied by a therapist were m**ore effi**cacious than the waiting-list condition. Treatment gains were maintained at 1-year follow-up. The results from this study support the utility of Internet-delive**red** CBT programs in order to reach a higher number of people who could benef**it **from CBT. Interne**t-d**elivered CBT programs could also play a valuable role in the d**iss**emination of CBT.  2010, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-77955887970
18. **Bipolar disorder and PTSD screening and telepsychiatry diagnoses in primary care**
Objective: To describe clinical diagnoses from telepsychiatrist consultation in safety net primary care settings for adult patients screening positive for bipolar disorder, PTSD, or both. Methods: Patients were administered the PTSD Checklist (PCL-6) and the Composite International Diagnostic Interview 3.0 (CIDI) for bipolar disorder. Positive screening result definitions were PCL-6 score of 14 and CIDI positive stem question responses and score of 8. Patient characteristics were assessed by survey. Psychiatrists consulted in primary care via telehealth and recorded clinical diagnoses. Results: Among 767 patients attending consultation with a telepsychiatrist, 495 (65%) screened PCL-6 positive only, 249 (32%) screened both PCL-6 and CIDI positive, and 23 (3%) screened CIDI positive. Approximately two-thirds screening PCL-6 positive were diagnosed with PTSD, and most had comorbid mood disorder diagnoses, with bipolar disorder diagnosis occurring more often in those screening CIDI positive compared to negative (42% vs. 15%). Positive predictive values were 64.9% for PCL-6 and 43.8% for CIDI. Conclusion: Most individuals screening positive for PTSD and/or bipolar disorder had two or more psychiatric diagnoses; misclassification exists for both instruments but was greater for CIDI. Psychiatrist consultation early in treatment for individuals screening positive on the PCL-6 and/or CIDI could help clarify diagnoses and improve treatment planning.  2020 The Authors eid: 2-s2.0-85084993436

0. **Are There Other Options?: Child and Adolescent Telepsychiatry Services for Rural Population**
This study compared University of Missouri **child** and **adolesc**ent telepsychiatry services patients specific zip codes** to c**hild **and ado**lescent psychiatrists practice locations to learn if telehealth was an appropriate option for this group of patients. In demographically and geographically diverse state such as Missouri, patients in **rural** areas may have limited or no access to timely, affordable and quality care. Many large urban health-care institutions have turned to telehealth as a means of providing equal access to care for all population, no matter where they choose to live. The management analyst system Cognos/Analyzer was used as a data source. Patient- and provider-specific zip codes were processed using GeoKettle software, and ArcGIS explorer was used for map visualization. While patients ut**ilizi**ng ch**ild and** adolescent telepsychiatry services come from various parts of the state, providers are mostly clustered in urban locations along the Interstate 70. This greatly limits access to specialty care **for r**ural and other vulnerable populations. Telehealth provides adequate and timel**y acc**ess t**o child** and adolescent psychiatry services for the youth that may otherwise not be able to get needed care. Barriers such as mental health crisis and access to c**are f**or rural population have been more or less successfully addressed by telehealth for several decades now. However, the shortage of specialty physicians adds an additional layer of complexity to this issue. Health-care organizations with informatics tools such as telemedicine need to focus their efforts on maximizing usage to allow more access for the underserved population.  2016 Indian Institute of Health Management Research. eid: 2-s2.0-84977570445
1. **School-Based Telepsychiatry in an Urban Setting: Efficiency and Satisfaction with Care**
Background and Introduction: Given the shortage of **child** psychiatrists in most areas, telepsychiatry may increase accessibility of psychiatric care in schools, in part by improving psychiatrists' efficiency and reach. The current study assessed consumer and provider **satisfact**ion with school-based telepsychiatry versus in-person sessions in 25 urban public schools and compared the efficiency of these service delivery models. Materials and Methods: In total, **714 satis**faction surveys were completed by parents, students, school clinicians, **and c**hild psychiatrists following initial (26.3%) and follow-up (67.2%) visits (6.4% did not indicate type of visit). Most of these surveyed visits were for medication management (69.9%) or initiation of medication (22%). Efficiency analyses compared time saved via telepsychiatry versus in-person care. Researchers also conducted focus groups with providers to clarify preferences and concerns about telepsychiatry versus in-person visits. Results: Consumers were highly satisfied with both in-person and telepsychiatry-provided school psychiatry services and showed no significant differences in preference. Providers reported both in-person and telepsychiatry were equally effective and showed a slight preference for in-person sessions, citing concerns about ease of video equipment use. Telepsychiatry services were more efficient than in-person services, as commute/setup occupied about 28 psychiatrist hours total per month. Discussion and Conclusions: Findings suggest that students, parents, and school clinicians perceive school-based telepsychiatry positively and equal to on-sit**e car**e. **Child psychiatri**sts have apprehension about using equipment, so equipment training/preparation and provision of technical support are needed. Implications of study findings for telepsychiatry training and implementation in schools are discussed.  2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2020. eid: 2-s2.0-85077861024
2. **Exploring the Telepsychiatry Experience: Primary Care Provider Perception of the Michigan Child Collaborative Care (MC3) Program**
Background: Pediatric mental healthcare is a growing component of primary care practice. However, there is a lack of access to **mental health servic**es, particularly those provided by **Child** and **Adolesc**ent Psychiatrists. The Michi**gan C**hild Collaborative Care (MC3) Program is a telepsychiatry service that offers embedded behavioral health consultants within primary care practices, telephonic consultation, video consultation and embedded care. Primary care provider (PCP) utilization of telepsychiatry services is predicated on perceiving the consultation service as user-friendly, helpful, and feasible in their practice. Objective: A survey of PCPs was conducted over a 5-year period to assess PCP attitudes and perceptions regarding MC3 consultation, including measures of efficiency, user-friendliness, and confidence in providing mental healthcare. The survey contained 4 items, (2 quantitative and 2 qualitative), and took less than 2 minutes to complete. Results: 649 responses were received out of 1475 possible responses (44% response rate). Common themes elicited from the qualitative items included perception of improved patient care for youth with mental illness (45.3%), improved comfort and confidence in caring for youth with mental illness (30.9%), greater comfort with the prescribing and monitoring of psychotropics (25.9%) and improved access to mental healthcare for youth (23.1%). PCPs strongly agreed that MC3 was user-friendly, efficient, and enhanced their confidence in managing pediatric mental health concerns. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that the MC3 Telepsychiatry Program is well accepted by PCPs with self-reported improvements in providing mental healthcare to patients. Future research should explore how PCP perception impacts PCP practice, knowledge, as well as outcomes for patients and families longitudinally.  2018 Academy of Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry eid: 2-s2.0-85051084783
3. **Telepsychiatry in a Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Service**
Objectives: To carry out a survey on the use of video conferencing equipment by a **rural** **child** psychiatric multidisciplinary team and to determine what impact the introduction of this equipment had on service provision. Method: Several aspects were studied including user **satisfact**ion and estimations of cost saving, on the basis of avoidance of travel to and from the regional base in Galway. A questionnaire was also developed to determine whether alternative contact would have been made if if this new technology were not in place. Results: The results of the initial six months following commencement were investigated. Use of the equipment was attempted 17 times during this period. Most members of **the c**hild psychiatry team participated in its use. Visual problems accounted for 66.7% of reported technical difficulty and 88.9% of users rated their level** of satis**faction with the equipment as 'Satisfied' or 'Very Satisfied'. Conclusions: Apart from the start-up cost implications of installing this equipment, it satisfied its aim of increasing contact between **the r**ural service and St** Anne**'s Children Centre in Galway. The equipment was easy to use and for the most part reliable. eid: 2-s2.0-33750492301
4. **The Childrens Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Telemental Health Treatment Study: Caregiver Outcomes**
The **Child**rens Attention-deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Telemental Health Treatment Study (CATTS) tested the hypotheses t**hat c**hildren and caregivers who received guideline-based treatment delivered through a hybrid telehealth service delivery model would experience greater improvements in outcom**es th**an children and caregivers receiving treatment via a comparison delivery model. Here, we present caregiver outcomes. 88 primary care providers (PCPs) in seven geographically underserved communities r**eferr**ed 223 children (ages 5.5  12.9years) to the randomized controlled trial**. Ove**r 22weeks, children randomized to the CATTS service delivery model received six sessions of telepsychiatry and six sessions of caregiver behavior management training provided in person by community therapists who were trained and s**uperv**ised remotely. Children randomized to the comparison Augmented Primary Care (APC) service model received management in primary care augmented by a single telepsychiatry consultation. Caregiver outcomes included changes in distress, as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Parenting Stress Index (PSI), Caregiver Strain Questionnaire (CSQ) and Family Empowerment Scale (FES). Caregivers completed five assessments. Multilevel mixed effects regression modeling tested for differences between the two service delivery models in caregiver outcomes from baseline to 25weeks. Co**mpare**d to caregivers of children in t**he AP**C model, caregivers of children in the CATTS service model showed statistically significantly greater improvements on the PHQ-9 ( = -1.41, 95% CI = [2.74, 0.08], p <.05), PSI ( = 4.59, 95% CI = [7.87,  1.31], p <.001), CSQ ( = 5.41, 95% CI = [ 8.58, 2.24], p <.001) and FES ( = 6.69, 95% CI = [2.32, **11.06**], p <.01). Improvement in child ADHD symptoms mediated improved caregiver scores** on t**he PSI and CSQ. Improvement in child ODD behaviors mediated caregiver CSQ scores. The CATTS trial supports the effectiveness of a hybrid telehealth service delivery model** for **reducing distress in caregivers of children with ADHD and suggests a mechanism through whichthe service model affected caregiver distress.  2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York. eid: 2-s2.0-85008675424
5. **Child and adolescent telepsychiatry: Reliability studies needed**
The progress of **child** and **adolesc**ent psychiatry has been greatly influenced by the development and implementation of diagnostic reliability studies. The key components of these studies have been the use of standardized structured interviews, the use of trained interviewers, and reliability designs that confirm the level of interrater reliability for a diagnosis or a **number** of diagnoses in a specific clinical environment. Despite the impact of the methodologies associated with these studies and their acceptance as standards, there are no comparable studies** in c**hild **and ado**lescent telepsychiatry that use similar research methodologies or technologies. Most** of t**he ch**ild and** adolescent telepsychiatry literature is represented by program descriptions and patient/practitioner **satisfact**ion surveys evaluating the acceptance of the technology and the care delivered via telepsychiatry. The use of standardized measures and methodologies constitute the essential components of the** scie**nce o**f child** and adolescent psychiatry. Their use validates studies for practitioners as acceptable and allows the field to grow. Their absence undermines the credibility of any study and decreases its acceptance. Without science to substantiate the enthusiasm often expressed by those implementing systems of telepsychiatry, little progress will occur. Reviewed are structured int**ervie**ws us**ed in c**hild and adolescent psychiatry research, a critique of current designs, and potential considerations for the develo**pment** of s**tudies **in child and adolescent telepsychiatry research. eid: 2-s2.0-0034527738
6. **Transforming Child and Youth Mental Health Care via Innovative Technological Solutions**
Live interactive videoconferencing and other technologies offer innovative opportunities for effective delivery of specialized **child** and **adolesc**ent **mental health servic**es. In this article, an example of a comprehensive telepsychiatry program is presented to highlight a variety of capacity-building initiatives that are responsive to community needs and cultures; these initiatives are allow**ing c**hildren, youth and caregivers to access otherwise-distant specialist services within their home communities. Committed, enthusiastic champions, adequate funding and infrastructure, creativity and a positive attitude represent key elements in the adaptation of this demonstrated user-friendly modality. eid: 2-s2.0-84880173560
7. **Parental attitudes to a telehealth parent coaching intervention for autism spectrum disorder**
Introduction: This study examined the potential feasibility of tele-delivered parent coaching in a **rural** area of Italy through a survey of parents attitudes towards this type of intervention. Methods: Parents of all **child**ren up to six years of age registered with a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder at the clinic catering for the area were invited to take part in the study. The final sample consisted of 43 parents. Results: Parents with worse Internet skills and those who reported lower levels of **satisfact**ion with currently received services were less likely to be willing to enrol. There was a trend for parents with lower self-efficacy to be less likely to enrol. Educational level, previous experience of video-calling, travel time to the clinic **and c**hilds level of ability were not associated with the choice of enrolment. Discussion: Implications for strategies to contrast barriers to adoption and strengthen implementation plans are discussed.  2016,  The Author(s) 2016. eid: 2-s2.0-85018777751
8. **Child and adolescent telepsychiatry clinics**
Now that we are in our sixth year of providing **child** telepsychiatry services, we are convinced that the psychiatric needs** of c**hildren can be safely and reliably met. Each of our clinics continues to successfully operate and grow. However, despite our successes, many questions remain to be answered. We are currently examining outcomes and cost effectiveness. We are also evaluating as to whether more intensive therapies, such as play therapy, can be conducted via telemedicine. We believe that as costs come down, quality of the equipment improves, and, most importantly, people's comfort level with telemedicine increases, the **number** and variety of telemedicine clinics will continue to expand. eid: 2-s2.0-0033450059
9. **Supporting primary care through pediatric telepsychiatry**
This paper describes a pediatric telepsychiatry program serving communities in **rural** Ontario, Canada. Since the program's inception in 2000, over 4,300 direct clinical consultations have been provided for a variety of presenting issues. Indirect consultations and educational sessions have augmented clinicians' knowledge. Participant evaluation of the program indicates that a comprehensive model of psychiatric consultation and education can be delivered effectively via live interactive videoconferencing to support primary care and to enhance capacity in remote, underserviced areas in Ontario. eid: 2-s2.0-62549160919
10. **Telepsychiatry with child welfare families referred to a family service agency**
A telepsychology and telepsychiatry service, using ISDN interactive video H.320, providing psychological consultations for the Family Resource Center in Farmington, New Mexico, was evaluated. During the first year of service, 56 individuals participated including University of New Mexico staff, Family Resource Center staff and clients. Consultations involved **child**ren from families referred by **the C**hildren, Youth and Family Department (CYFD) in New Mexico. Telemedicine was used **in so**me child abuse cases. This study investigated whether the quality and acceptance of telemedicine consultations were comparable to face-to-face interactions in a group referred** by a** state child welfare agency. Participants received formal written consultation reports after the video conferencing sessions, which included a **number** of recommendations. Participants were asked to complete an anonymous questionnaire to rate various aspects of videoconferencing. The participants rated the university staff as involved, enjoyed the Family Resource Center staff's presence, felt the procedure was useful for evaluation purposes, found the format allowed for discussions of problems, and felt that the format was useful when compared to face-to-face consultations. The participants also said they had followed up on many of the recommendations. Videoconferencing appears to be a viable approach for providing consultation for families refe**rred **by a state child welfare agency. Several participants rated the session as both educational and consultative compared to simply therapeutic. eid: 2-s2.0-15344349269
11. **Telepharmacotherapy for Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Patients**
Objective: The purpose of this study is to review and discuss the status of telepsychiatry practice, particularly as applied to treating **child**ren and **adolesc**ents with psychotropic medications, which is termed "telepharmacotherapy." Methods: The literature pertinent to telepsychiatry practice is reviewed, followed by a presentation of the challenges to implementing telepharmacotherapy, potential solutions, current controversies, and future directions, combining insights from the literature with the authors' own experiences. Results: Telepsychiatry services **for c**hildren **and ado**lescents are expanding, and provide needed pharmacotherapy for patients who are underserved by available resources. The evidence base supporting the effectiveness of telepsychiatry practice and telepharmacotherapy is still emerging, and consists mainly of feasibility and **satisfact**ion studies with limited outcome data. Although a **number** of challenges to this mode of care delivery currently exist, the authors outline potential solutions for those challenges that are consistent with existing guidelines for clinical practice. Conclusions: Telepsychiatry appears to be a feasible **and satis**factory alternative to in-person care, and a valid option for increasing access to psychopharmacother**apy f**or child**ren and** adolescents. Although the evidence base is still emerging, and practitioners may fac**e a nu**mber of challenges, solutions are presented that may help to overcome those challenges.

12. **Using telepsychology to provide a group parenting program: A preliminary evaluation of effectiveness**
Telepsychology offers the potential to reach **rural** and underserved **child**ren and families with mental health concerns. The current study evaluated the effects of using videoconferencing technology to deliver an evidence-based parenting program, the Group Triple P Positive Parenting Program (Group Triple P; Turner, Markie-Dadds, & Sanders, 2002), with families who ha**d a c**hild experiencing behavioral problems. Using a pre/post design, families (N = 13) from low socioeconomic backgrounds in Kentucky completed the Group Triple P via a videoconferencing delivery format. A benchmarking strategy (Weersing & Hamilton, 2005) indicated that treatment effect sizes for the videoconferencing format were generally comparable to treatment effect sizes for Group Triple P studies conducted in-person. Specif**icall**y, child behavior and parenting outcomes were similar across delivery formats. Implications of the study's findings and future directions for telepsychology research and practice with underserved f**amili**es and children are discussed.  2015 American Psychological Association. eid: 2-s2.0-84938206433
13. **Mental health services for Nunavut children and youth: Evaluating a telepsychiatry pilot project**
Introduction: This study examines the delivery of psychiatric consultation services using videoconferencing technology to health and mental health workers in the Nunavut territory of Canada. The research provides insights into the TeleLink Mental Health Program and the delivery of professional-to-professional program consultations and continuing education seminars. Methods: Participant observation of 12 program consultations and four continuing education sessions was conducted. Individual interviews were conducted with the consulting psychiatrist and the lead program coordinator in Nunavut. As well, a focus group was held with Nunavut workers who participated in the televideo sessions. Results: The study found a **number** of factors that facilitated or hindered the process and content of a consultation-based telepsychiatry program and its effect on building capacity among frontline staff. Four main themes emerged related to the delivery of psychiatric services via televideo: gaining access, ensuring culturally appropriate services, providing relevant continuing education, and offering stable and confidential technology. Conclusions: Live interactive videoconferencing technology is an innovative and effective way of delivering specialized **mental health servic**es to professionals working in remote areas of Nunavut. Study results provide important strategies for expanding this approach to other jurisdictions in Nunavut and other Inuit regions.  T Volpe, KM Boydell, A Pignatiello, 2014. eid: 2-s2.0-84904618501
14. **Telepsychiatry: Addressing mental health needs in Georgia**
Creation of a comprehensive mental health telecommunications system to serve isolated persons in Georgia, resulting in a more equitable distribution of mental health resources, is the goal of the telepsychiatry program at the Medical College of Georgia. Although telepsychiatric consultation is not a new idea, the 'distribution' of telepsychiatry through additional integrated telecommunications channels such as the World Wide Web is a distinctive approach. This report describes the history of the development of the MCG Telepsychiatry Program. Through the use of a multichanneled telecommunications system, a more equitable distribution of mental health resources is underway in Georgia. eid: 2-s2.0-0033816892
15. **Attracting child psychiatrists to a televideo consultation service: The telelink experience**
Objective. Identify aspects of psychiatry work that are rewarding, as well as those that are challenging, from the perspective of psychiatrists and residents participating in televideo consultation services. Method. A web-based survey was distributed to psychiatrists within the Division of **Child** Psychiatry at the University of Toronto. Also, semistructured interviews were conducted with **six c**hild psychiatrists providing services to a telepsychiatry program. Finally, a focus group interview was held with four psychiatry residents. R**esult**s. **Child psychiatri**sts are very comfortable conducting assessments via televideo. Factors identified as being important in the decision to participate in telepsychiatry include assisting underserved communities, supportive administrative staff, enhanced **rural** provider capacity, financial incentives, and convenience. The study's qualitative phase identified four themes in the decision to participate in telepsychiatry: (1) organizational, (2) shared values, (3) innovation, and (4) the consultation model. Conclusion. The success of televideo consultation programs in** attr**act**ing child psychi**atrists to provide consultation services to underresourced communities makes an important contribution to psychiatric workforce shortages. Understanding what aspects of telepsychiatry are most appreciated by consulting psychiatrists and residents offers useful strategies to telepsychiatry administrators and medical school educators seeking to attract, train, and retain psychiatry practitioners.  2013 Tiziana Volpe et al. eid: 2-s2.0-84880149736
16. **Telepsychiatry improves paediatric behavioural health care in rural communities**
In the US, **child**ren with special health care needs are underserved by both the medical and educational systems. This problem is especially serious in **rural** states. Telemedicine is a technique that can reduce these gaps in service and help connect the two systems. The technology required has become cheaper and more accessible. Progress on reimbursement for such services has also been made. For some years, we have provided telepsychiatry **for c**hildren in Washington State using videoconferencing. Interviews with families and service providers were conducted in Washington and Missouri. Some parents reported tha**t the**ir child actually preferred telepsychiatry to conventional consultation. The telepsychiatry service model was built on the existing system of outreach clinics, thus involving specialists who were familiar with the community and who were known and trusted by the community. Before starting, we ensured that all relevant service delivery agencies and providers were comfortable about using videoconferencing as a method of service delivery. In the 18-month period ending in March 2003, three providers in Seattle saw 159 patients by telepsychiatry and 210 patients face-to-face at the hospital clinic. The main barrier to further growth of the telepsychiatry service is the absence of reimbursement for telepsychiatry. eid: 2-s2.0-34548040642
17. **Weight status of children and adolescents in a telepsychiatry clinic**
The prevalence of overweight and obesity is approximately 32% among **child**ren and **adolesc**ents in the United States. Comorbid conditions associated with pediatric overweight and obesity include psychiatric conditions. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of overweight and obesity am**ong c**hildren **and ado**lescents presenting for consultation from **rural** communities to the UC Davis Telemedicine Program (UCDTP), as well as to collect preliminary data to design an integrated disease management prog**ram f**or child**ren and** adolescents with obesity and mental illness. Patients aged 21 and under seen for psychiatric consultation at the UCDTP between 2004 and 2006 were included. Retrospective medical record review was conducted to determine the major psychiatric diagnoses, height, weight, body-mass index, and weight status (underweight/at risk for underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese) for each patient. Of the 230 patients referred, a total of 121 patients had both height and weight values documented. Three patients were underweight; 51 were normal weight; 28 were overweight; 39 were obese. The most common psychiatric diagnoses in the 121 patients were attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; n=40), bipolar disorder (n=36), and depression (n=31). The most common psychiatric diagnoses in patients with available weight and height data who were overweight and obese were bipolar disorder (n=20), depression (n=18), and ADHD (n=17). Approxima**tely **55% o**f child** and adolescent patients seen for telepsychiatry consultation whose charts documented height and weight measurements were overweight or obese. Psychiatric diagnoses in overweight youngsters need to be researched further to determine whether the weight change is primary or secondary to mood and/or to treatments, such as medication. At such a high rate of comorbidity, monitoring the weight status of young psychiatric patients in this population is indicated.  2009, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-74249085171
18. **Testing effectiveness of a community-based aggression management program for children 7 to 11 years old and their families**
OBJECTIVE: There are few well-evaluated uncomplicated community-based interventions for **child**hood aggression. The authors assess the impact of a community-based anger management group** on c**hild aggressive behaviors, using a randomized, controlled trial (RCT). METHOD: Famili**es wi**th children 7 to 11 years old were recruited through advertisements and randomized (N = 123). Inclusion required parent concern about anger/aggressive behavior, RCT agreement, and a telephone behavior screen. Intervention participants were offered three parent education/skill-building group sessions**, 10 **weekly child group sessions, and three in-home family practice sessions. Nine groups ran from August 2002 to August 2004. Interviewers nave to randomization collected data on all participants pre- and postgroup. Ou**tcome**s included child-rated ang**er an**d parent-rated child aggressive behavior, externalizing behavio**r and** hostility, parent-child relationship, and parenting stress. Intent-to-treat analyses were done. RESULTS: Pre/postoutcome comparisons indicated no significant differences between intervention versus control, with small effect sizes for most outcomes (0.27-0.29). Although not significant, the magnitude of improvement favored intervention families on all parent-rated measures. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, there was no differential impact of participating in a community-based anger managem**ent g**roup versus control on child aggressive behaviors and other associated measures. The impact of regression to the mean, eff**ect, **and sample size estimates; child comorbidity; and programmatic and methodological issues are discuss**ed. 2**006 by the American Academy of Child and **Adolesc**ent Psychiatry. eid: 2-s2.0-33748434647
19. **Methodology for conducting the Children's Attention-deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Telemental Health Treatment Study in multiple underserved communities**
Background **Child**ren living in nonmetropolitan communities are underserved by evidence-based mental health care and are underrepresented in clinical trials. Purpose In this article, we describe lessons learned in conducting **the C**hildrens Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Telemental Health (TMH) Treatment Study (CATTS), a randomized controlled trial testing the effectiveness of TMH in improving outc**omes **of children with ADHD living in underserved communiti**es. M**ethods Children were referred by primary care providers (PCPs). The test intervention group received six telepsychiatry sessions with each session followed by an caregiver behavior training session delivered in-person by a local therapist. A secure website was used to support decision making by the telepsychiatrists and to facilitate real-time collaboration between the telepsychiatrists and community therapists. The control group received a single telepsychiatry consultation. Questionnaires tapping ADHD symptoms and other outcomes were administered to parents and teachers online through a secure portal from personal computers. Results A total of 88 PCPs in seven communities r**eferr**ed the 223 children who participated in the trial. Attrition in treatment sessions and research assessments was very low. Lessons learned TMH proved to be a viable means of providing evidence-based pharmaco**logic**al services to children and training to local therapists. Recruitment was enhanced by offering the control group a telepsychiatry consultation. Sitespecific strategies were needed to meet recruitment targets. Conclusions The CATTS trial used methods designed t**o opt**imize inclusion of children living in multiple dispersed and underserved areas. The study will serve as a model for other research projects aiming at reducing geographic disparities in access to quality mental health care.  2012 The Author(s). eid: 2-s2.0-84889824159
20. **E-CYMHS: An expansion of a child and youth telepsychiatry model in Queensland**
Objectives: The purpose of this study was to describe the evolution of the E-**Child** and Youth **Mental Health Servic**e (E-CYMHS), which supports regional and **rura**l** mental health se**rvices by providing access to consult**ant c**hild and **adolesc**ent psychiatrists to isolated staff in regional areas, where access to specialist psychiatric services is limited. Conclusions: E-CYMHS provides a level of parity in mental health care between metropolitan, regional and remote services through the provision of regular videoconferencing servic**es wi**th child **and ado**lescent psychiatrists and senior allied health clinicians. The three key features which underpin the success of the service are: 1. A central co-ordinator of services; 2. Provision of support outside regular videoconference times; and 3. Routine outreach visits that foster community capacity-building. E-CYMHS has been well received by the r**egional mental healt**h services it supports, and the total provision of services has more than doubled over the last three years. It is anticipated that as telepsychiatry is increasingly viewed as a credible alternative to traditional means of patient care, this trend is likely to continue.  2012 The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists. eid: 2-s2.0-84872155638

22. **Ten-year experience of a private nonprofit telepsychiatry service**
This paper reports the results of a **satisfact**ion survey of telepsychiatry patients at a **rural** community mental health clinic that had been providing psychiatric services solely via telemedicine for 10 years. The survey examined the perceived telepsychiatric session quality over a relatively long period of time with patients who had been utilizing the services for a **number** of years or over multiple sessions. Onepage optional anonymous surveys were distributed from December 1, 2006, through March 30, 2007, covering 230 telepsychiatry patients, approximately 90% of current telepsychiatry patients at the agency. Of these, 76 patients responded, a 33.0% return rate. Among the responden**ts, satis**faction was generally very high, with telemedicine services provided over a period of up to 10 years perceived to be of similar (no worse) quality than in-person services. Results were further analyzed by gender, age, **and nu**mber of telemedicine sessions experienced. Female patients appeared more accepting of the quality of medical care via telemedicine than male patients. Patients aged 20-49 had much higher acceptance rates than patients younger than 20 or older than 49. The least positive responses toward telemedicine were from patients in their 50s. Patients who had experienced 5 to 10 telemedicine sessions were more likely than patients who had experienced fewer than 5 to report that their sessions now run more smoothly than their initial sessions. Patients in their 20s and 30s reported the least need to have a clinician in the room with them to make them feel comfortable during their telemedicine sessions. Eight percent of respondents reacted negatively to the presence of a clinician in the room with them during their telemedicine sessions.

23. **The use of telepsychiatry to provide cost-efficient care during pediatric mental health emergencies**
Objective: This study evaluated a videoconference-based psychiatric emergency consultation program (telepsychiatry) at geographically dispersed emergency department (ED) sites that are part of the network of care of an academic **child**ren's hospital system. The study compared program outcomes with those of usual care involving ambulance transport to the hospital for in-person psychiatric emergency consultation prior to disposition to inpatient care or discharge home. Methods: This study compared process outcomes in a cross-sectional, pre-post design at five network-of-care sites before and after systemwide implementation of telepsychiatry consultation in 2015. Clinical records on 494 pediatric psychiatric emergencies included ED length of stay, disposition/discharge, and hospital system charges. **Satisfact**ion surveys regarding telepsychiatry consultations were completed by providers and parents or guardians. Results: Compared w**ith c**hildren who received usua**l car**e, children who received telepsychiatry consultations had significantly shorter median ED lengths of stay (5.5 hours and 8.3 hours, respectively, p<.001) and lower total patient charges ($3,493 and $8,611, p<.001). Providers and patient caregivers reported h**igh satis**faction with overall acceptability, effectiveness, and efficiency of telepsychiatry. No safety concerns were indicated based on readmissions within 72 hours in either treatment condition. Conclusions: Measured by charges and time, telepsychiatry consultations for pediatric psychiatric emergencies were cost-efficient from a hospital system perspective compared with usual care consisting of ambulance transport for in-person consul**tatio**n at a children's hospital main campus. Telepsychiatry also improved clinical and operational efficiency and patient and family experience, and it showed promise for increasing access to other specialized health care needs.

25. **The experience in Victoria with telepsychiatry for the child and adolescent mental health service**
In 1995, the Royal **Child**ren's Hospital **Mental Health Servic**e in Melbourne developed the first telepsychiatry programme** in c**hild and **adolesc****ent mental health se**rvices (CAMHS) in Australia. A survey of 25 CAMHS clinicians in five **rural** regions who had used videoconferencing showed that 64% had used the technology for more than 18 months, and 20% had used it for 7-12 months. Also, 60% had used the technology on over 30 occasions, and 24% had used it on 20-29 occasions. Respondents clearly recognized its benefits in terms of their increased knowledge and skills (96%), strengthening of relationships with colleagues (92%) and decreased sense of isolation (92%). To build on the success of telepsychiatry there are a **number** of challenges that health service managers will need to address. Telepsychiatry works most effectively as a tool to complement face-to-face contact. It cannot be promoted as the total solution to the issue of isolation from mainstream services. eid: 2-s2.0-0035232380
26. **Establishing a telepsychiatry consultation practice in rural Georgia for primary care physicians: A feasibility report**
Objective. One approach to solving mental health care disparity issues in **rural** areas is by establishing a telepsychiatry consultation practice for **child**ren, in which a psychiatrist see**s a c**hild via videoconferencing for a limited **number** of sessions and then provides a treatment plan **to th**at child's primary care physician and family. Method. The present study offered a 2-session telepsychiatry consultation clinic, consisting of a psychiatric evaluation session and a recommendation session, with patients located remotely** in r**ural Georgia. Results. Fifteen consult**ation**s with children aged 4 to 18 years (M = 9.73, SD = 3.39) with varying diagnoses were completed. Parental **satisfact**ion with the telepsychiatry consultation model was high, overall mean of 4.58 (SD = 0.63) on a 5-point scale (n = 11).

27. **From pilot to permanent service: Ten years of paediatric telepsychiatry**
The **Child** and **Adolesc**ent Psychological Telemedicine Outreach Service (CAPTOS) in Sydney has been providing telepsychiatry services in New South Wales (NSW) for ten years. Services are provided to over 40 sites in remote and **rural** NSW. There are eight telepsychiatry clinics a week, providing almost 600 consultations a year. As well as telepsychiatry, three additional services are provided: professional supervision, education and training, and Aborigi**nal c**hild **and ado**lescent mental health traineeships. The service was re-evaluated in 2004 using a semi-structured interview to obtain information about service **satisfact**ion and effectiveness from hub **and r**ural clinicians. There continues to be a high level** of satis**faction with the telepsychiatry service and with other telemedicine services, such as clinical supervision and teaching.

28. **Assessment of SUNY Upstate medical university's child telepsychiatry consultation program**
Objectives: The project assesses the **child** telepsychiatry services provided by SUNY Upstate psychiatrists to several county mental health clinics in central New York State. Method: Data for 45 patients was extracted from pre-consultation forms completed by the referring clinic and postconsultation summaries completed by the Upstate psychiatrists that occurred between July 13, 2009 and May 12, 2010. The study identified characteristics of patients for whom telepsychiatry consultations were sought, why they were sought, and reviewed recommended changes in therapy and medication provided by the telepsychiatry consultant. Results: Analysis of the data showed that there was a large variation in patient characteristics such as age (from age 3 to 17), current living situation, and psychological symptoms. In addition to a family history of mental illness (80%), the most common symptoms were physical aggression (60.0%), defiant/oppositional behavior (57.8%), and attentional problems (55.6%). The most common reason for referral was diagnostic clarification (67%). **The c**hild telepsychiatrist recommended a change in medication for most (80.8%) of the patients who were on medications, and to begin medications for most (63.2%) who were not receiving medication at the time of consult. Further, the telepsychiatrist often recommended the addition of family therapy (71.1%) and counseling at school (17.8%). Conclusi**on: T**he child telepsychiatric program at Upstate seemed effective. It reached a large** vari**ety of children with significant mental disorders. The consultants provided diagnostic clarification and recommended modification of treatment for most. However, this assessment is limited as examined as it did not include follow-up information on whether consultant recommendations were followed and, if they were, whether they were effective.  2011, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-81755188307
29. **A statewide child telepsychiatry consult system yields desired health system changes and savings**
Background: Telepsychiatry has clinical efficacy with **child**ren, but questions remain about cost-effectiveness. State agencies and health systems need to know i**f a c**hild telepsychiatry consult system can address system concerns and improve care quality while lowering costs. Materials and Methods: To assist care in a **rural** state w**ith f**ew child and **adolesc**ent psychiatrists, an academic center coordinated a consult system of (1) televideo consults for** high**-needs children with Medicaid and state Multidisciplinary Team (MDT)/foster care involvement, (2) remote medication reviews for beyond guidelines prescribing, and (3) elective community provider telephone-based consults. Consult service data were collected and analyzed with Wyoming's Medicaid and Foster Care Divisions between the program start in January 2011 until March 2013. Results: There were 229 televideo MDT/foster care consults, 125 mandatory medication reviews, and 277 elective phone consultations supporting community providers during this period. Following implementation, the num**ber o**f Medicaid children 5 years of age using psychotropic medications decreased by 42% (p<0.001)**, and** the **number** of children using psychotropic doses >150% of the Food and Drug Administration maximum decreased by 52% (p<0.001). Televideo con**sults** redirected 60% of children slated by caseworkers for a psychiatric residential treatment facility admission into alternative community treatment and placements. A financial return on investment was 1.82 to 1 for combined services. Co**nclus**ions: This coordinated child telepsychiatry consult system for a state Medicaid division reduced outlier pediatric psychiatric medication prescribing, supported local community-delivered treatments, and reduced unnecessary hospitalizations in a financially advantageous manner that was well received by the practice community.  2015, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-84936936665
30. **Improved access to mental health evaluation for patients with developmental disabilities using telepsychiatry**
The Cedars-Sinai Telepsychiatry Clinic uses a collaborative-care model to treat patients with developmental disabilities. We examined its practice in four areas: patient characteristics, clinical care, symptom severity and diagnostic outcomes to describe the care provided and the population seen in the telepsychiatry clinic. In a chart review, 45 out of 126 cases were selected and evaluated at three times: initial evaluation, year one and year three. Most of the patients (84%) had an intellectual disability, 55% had a pervasive developmental disorder and 71% spoke approximately 50 words or less. Prior to the initial assessment, none of the patients were diagnosed with anxiety or mood disorders, while almost one-third of patients received one of these diagnoses in the telepsychiatry clinic. Patients were seen six times on average in the fi{ligature}rst year and three times in the second and third years. The telepsychiatrist recommended a change in the patient's medication for 82% of patients at initial assessment, 41% at year one and 46% at year three. The review suggests that telepsychiatry evaluations can be valuable for patients with developmental disabilities, providing diagnostic clarity and specifi{ligature}c recommendations that can be implemented by the primary care physician. eid: 2-s2.0-84865826955

**Child**ren and **adolesc**ents living in **rural** areas have difficulty accessing psychological services due to a lack of psychologists and other behavioral health professionals, especially those with expertise in treating youth. Telepsychology helps bridge this access gap. This article extends evidence supporting videoconferencing for psychological assessment and treatment in adults to support telepsychological treatment for youth. In addition, the basic components needed to begin and sustain a telepsychological practice are explored. Finally, a case example of** an ado**lescent presenting with depression and disordered eating illustrates the practice of, and ethical standards needed for, telepsychology.

33. **Telepsychiatry assessments of child or adolescent behavior disorders: A review of evidence and issues**
Background: The limited **number** of mental health specialists for **child**ren has led to an increased need **for c**hild and **adolesc**ent psychiatrists to provide primary care consultations and treatment recommendations. Psychiatric assessments and treatments provided via two-way videoconferencing (telepsychiatry) have been used to increase the availabi**lity **of **child psychiatri**sts. This article reviews the literature on telepsychiatry as**sessm**ent of children **and ado**lescents. Methods: Research on telepsychiatry has focused on the comparability of telepsychiatric treatments to in-person treatment for adult patients. Relatively little research has addressed the ability of telepsychiatric assessments to facilitate favorable treatment outcomes, p**artic**ularly for c**hild or** adolescent patients. This was a literature search using Medline via Ovid. It focused on English-language material published between 1996 and 2009. A range of search terms relating to assessment, mental health**, tel**emedicine, and children was used. **Any s**tudies focusing o**n child** and adolescent psychiatric assessment were included. Results**: The** limited literature on children is usually related to project descriptions or case reports. The studies tend to find acceptance and the diagnoses and recommendations are not seen as different from in-person assessments. Practical considerations that arise in giving telepsychiatric assessments are discussed. Conclusion: Although there are significant weaknesses in the research justifying** tele**psychiatric assessments **in chil**dren and adolescents, there are no data that suggest that this process contributes to negative outcomes. Details on the setting for telepsychiatry assessments and camera view have not been studied.  2010, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-77956140102
34. **A review of the outcomes of the recommendations made during paediatric telepsychiatry consultations**
Little is known about whether the recommendations made during telepsychiatry are actually implemented. We reviewed 100 telepsychiatry consultations, chosen randomly from a paediatric telepsychiatry programme serving **rural** communities in Ontario. Treatment recommendations had been made for each case reviewed and up to nine recommendations had been made for a single case. Twenty-seven percent of recommendations revolved around monitoring (10%), changing (9%), starting (4%), continuing (3%) and stopping (1%) medication. Case managers associated with 54 of the cases were interviewed to determine whether the recommendations had been implemented and to examine the barriers and facilitators to implementation. The results indicated that cooperation of both **child** and parent, clear communication of recommendations, involvement of the school and local health providers, stability of the agencies and availability of services were key components in the successful implementation of recommendations. The matter of technology or technological difficulties acting as a barrier to telepsychiatric consultations was not mentioned by case managers, suggesting that it was not a problem. eid: 2-s2.0-40149096886
35. **Effect of a behavioural health and specialty care telemedicine programme on goal attainment for youths in juvenile detention**
We conducted a pre-post study of the effect of a telepsychiatry counselling service on youths housed in three juvenile detention facilities. In the first year of the telemedicine programme, 321 psychiatry consultations were conducted via telemedicine; in the second year of the programme, 573 psychiatry consultations were conducted. Records for 190 students were then examined by two raters. The total **number** of behavioural goals for each **adolesc**ent increased from 8.2 in the pre-telemedicine year to 8.7 in the first year of telemedicine and then to 10.0 in the second year (P < 0.05). In Year 2 of the study, subjects also had a significantly hig**her nu**mber of goals in four of the five categories: education, family, health and social skills (P < 0.05). Although other changes at the youth detention facilities or in the juvenile justice system may have been partly responsible for the effects observed, the study suggests that telemedicine may be useful for improving the rate of attainment of goals associated with family relations and personality/behaviour. eid: 2-s2.0-64549154932
36. **Cost savings of telemedicine utilization for child psychiatry in a rural Kansas community**
The costs of pediatric telemedicine services remain underreported and understudied; however, there is evidence that telepediatric services can be cost competitive with traditional ones. For 15 years, the University of Kansas Center for Telemedicine and Telehealth has been providing telemental health outreach from the University of Kansas Medical Center (KUMC). One service site is located in Crawford County, Kansas, which provides telepsychiatry services to **child**ren and **adolesc**ents. The purpose of this study was to examine the costs of operating the Crawford County site relative to accessing services at KUMC, the likely alternative service location. The cost of travel time to parents who accompanied a dependent to either location also was estimated. Patients and parents were examined over a 6-month period in 2006. One hundred thirty-two patients received 257 telemedicine psychiatric consultations during this period. Cost estimates for using the pediatric telemedicine service were assessed for all patients; however, travel and related costs were collected from a sample of 26 patient-parent dyads. The estimated costs of services were obtained using standard cost-accounting procedures. An average cost per consultation in Crawford County was $168.61. The cost savings in travel time and other expenses to parents and patients were substantial between use of the county site and KUMC. Subtracting average savings in travel costs to patients and parents produced an average cost of a telepsychiatry consult in Crawford County of only $30.99. This study was conducted over 6 months with a small **number** of observations; it should be replicated over a longer study period, with more patients, and with more data that might capture marginal costs of services.

38. **A web-based tutorial for parents of young children with Autism: Results from a pilot study**
Objective: Early intervention can significantly improve long-term outcomes for **child**ren with autism. Unfortunately, m**any c**hildren do not receive early intervention services due to a critical shortage of trained professionals in this area. To bridge this gap, we evaluated a Web-based parent training tutorial (Enhancing Interactions), based on evidence-based practices and utilizing the Web-based platform to maximize learning. Methods: Twenty-three parents** with** a child between 18 months and 6 years with an autism spectrum disorder participated. Pre-and posttest scores of parents' knowledge were used to evaluate tutorial effectiveness. The system usability scale (SUS) evaluated technical user-friendliness and the user **satisfact**ion questionnaire (USQ), gau**ged satis**faction with content. Results: The mean **number** of correct items on the posttest significantly increased, from 12.6 to 20.4, p<0.001. The mean SUS score was 85 (standard deviation=17), corresponding to a score of "excellent." All participants found the tutorial user friendly, well integrated, and 96% (all but one participant) thought it was easy to use, felt confident using the technical features, and would use a tutorial like this again. On the USQ, all participants found that the tutorial was well organized, clearly presented, and easy to understand; that it increased their knowledge about communicating** with** their child; and that they felt capable of applying these techni**ques **with their child. Conclusions: The tutorial appears effective in increasing parents' knowledge with hi**gh user s**atisfaction.  2011, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-82455179552
39. **Telepsychiatry with children and adolescents: Are patients comparable to those evaluated in usual outpatient care?**
Several studies have described successful applications of telepsychiatry with **child**ren and **adolesc**ents. However, there has been little examination of the populations served by telepsychiatry and the ability to evaluate youth accurately through this medium. In this article, we examined whether telepsychiatry patients are representative of those in usual outpatient care. Participants included 369 patients 3-19 years old evaluated at two clinics. A new telepsychiatry clinic (TPC) developed to provide services to under-served communities, an**d a c**hild **and ado**lescent psychiatric outpatient clinic (CAPOC) that served youth from predominantly metropolitan areas were included in the study. The telepsychiatry sites were linked using ISDN lines at 384KB/sec. We examined these two samples regarding demographics, payor status, and diagnostic profiles. Results indicated that youth evaluated through the TPC were broadly comparable to youth evaluated in the CAPOC. Therefore, telepsychiatry appears to serve youth that are representative of those seeking psychiatric care, and it is not restricted to youth with no medical insurance or with selected diagnoses. The similarity of diagnoses further suggests that telepsychiatry provides adequate technical resolution and doctor-patient rapport to detect psychopathology of youths. These findings suggest the need for further systematic investigation of telepsychiatry as a tool for providing psychiatric care to young people. eid: 2-s2.0-4744374907
40. **A child and adolescent psychiatric outreach service for rural New South Wales: A telemedicine pilot study**
Objective: To examine the feasibility of a tertiary outreach service in **child** and **adolesc**ent psychiatry to two **rural** health centres in New South Wales, Australia. Methods: Following a site visit to Dubbo Hospital and Bourke Hospital, telemedical videoconferencing was provided for 2 h/week for 32 weeks. Details of referrers, patients' diagnosis and outcome, and **satisfact**ion with the service were obtained. Results: Cases were triaged by a nominated ru**ral ado**lescent mental health worker. The service provided detailed assessment and management of severe, complex, mental and neuropsychiatric disorders. Fifty-four young people were assessed and 72 joint consultative videoconferencing interviews were undertaken, including 26 initial consultations. Twenty-three initial consultations were undertaken on the visit to **the r**ural centres. Clinical descriptions illustrate the flexibility and sensitivity of the service. Conclusion: Telepsychiatry provides access to a flexible, effective tertiary service for those with special, complex needs, including the disadvantaged or isolated. It makes a valuable, economic contribution to supporting and ed**ucati**ng rural health professionals, thereb**y enr**iching rural **mental health servic**es. eid: 2-s2.0-0032702251
41. **The child and adolescent telepsychiatry consultation: Can it be a more effective clinical process for certain patients than conventional practice?**
The literature on the efficacy of telepsychiatry for assessing and treating **child**ren and **adolesc**ents with mental health problems is still developing, but there is evidence that telepsychiatry is diagnostically valid, and that there is high patient and provider **satisfact**ion. Outcome studies are awaited, with the assumption that telepsychiatry has to demonstrate at least as good outcomes and reliability as face-to-face psychiatric care. In this article we suggest, by reviewing the process of telepsychiatry w**ith c**hildren, and illustrating relevant issues with five case studies of patients we have seen, that there is a valid case for arguing that in **certa**in children **and ado**lescents, telepsychiatry, as a consultation process, might actually be a superior method of psychiatric assessment to face-to-face consultation. Four factors stand out supporting this view. These are the novelty of the consultation, the capacity to provide direction, the extra distance involved (both psychological and physical), and the authenticity of the interaction. More **resea**rch in ch**ild and** adolescent telepsychiatry is indicated.  2010, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-77952403959
42. **Evaluating satisfaction with a child and adolescent psychological telemedicine outreach service**
A **child** and **adolesc**ent telepsychiatry service in **rural** New South Wales was evaluated. Part of the evaluation was to assess whet**her r**ural mental health workers and patients were satisfied with the videoconferencing services provided** by c**hild psychiatrists f**rom t**he Children's Hospital at Westmead. During a 12-month study, information was collected using questionnaires on a total of 136 new patients who had been interviewed via videoconferencing. **Satisfact**ion questionnaires were completed** by 1**00 rural mental health workers, and 82 patients and their families/carers. Questionnaires ab**out satis**faction with the technology were compl**eted **by 136 child psychia**trist**s, 101 rural mental health workers and 79 patients. Patients and their families/car**ers, **as well as rural clinicians, expressed high **overall s**atisfaction with the telepsychiatry service. The evaluation suggested that videoconferencing is a good meth**od of** providing child **and ado**lescent psychiatry ser**vices** to remote and rural communities. eid: 2-s2.0-0043263814
43. **Diffusion of efficacious interventions for children and adolescents with mental health problems**
Background: **Child** and **adolesc**ent mental health problems are prevalent and require adequate interventions. Despite several evidence-based interventions for these problems described in the literature, few studies addressed strategies to diffuse efficacious interventions **for c**hild mental disorders especially in developing countries. Methods: An extensive but not systematic review of the literature was performed aiming to identify evidence-based interventi**ons f**or children **and ado**lescents with mental disorders, professionals to target in disseminating these interventions, and the available strategies to diffuse information. Results: Substantial evidence-based information is available to guide preventive, psychosocial and psychopharmacological interventions. The effectiveness of treatments in real-world settings and the cost-effectiveness of interventions are rarely tested. Professionals at different levels (teachers, school counselors, social workers, general practitioners, ped**iatri**cians, child psychologists and psychiatrists) should be targeted in diffusing efficacious in**terve**ntions for child mental health problems worldwide. Telepsychiatry and the internet seem to be the most promising strategies to diffuse knowledge with lower costs. Conclusions: Medical and allied professiona**ls mu**st incorporate ch**ild and** adolescent mental health issues in their under- and postgraduate curricula, and be better prepared to critically evaluate available information. Professionals need to disseminate evidence-based programs to guide parents and teachers in developing** coun**tries to deal wit**h child** and adolescent difficulties. Countries need to explore internet solutions for dissemination of medical information.  2007 The Authors. eid: 2-s2.0-40449105030
44. **Child and adolescent telepsychiatry: Variations in utilization, referral patterns and practice trends**
Seattle **Child**ren's Hospital is a tertiary referral hospital that has provided telepsychiatry to seven partner sites in the north-west since 2001. Service utilization data, patient demographics and diagnoses were collected for the period from the service inception in October 2001 until November 2007. During the study period, 701 patients were treated with a mean of 2.8 appointments per patient (SD 1.9). Five psychiatrists and four psychologists provided care. Utilization varied across referring sites and was largely dependent upon the availability of telepsychiatrists, although the degree of support from administration and stakeholders also contributed to the success of the service. A total of 190 primary care practitioners referred patients to telepsychiatry, including 106 family physicians and 71 paediatricians. Paediatricians referred to the service more frequently than family physicians (t 1/4 2.8, P, 0.05). Overall, telepsychiatry with young people is feasible, acceptable and increases access to mental health care. There appear to be four core components necessary to a successful telepsychiatry programme: psychiatrists who are interested in exploring new ways to reach underserved young people; clearly identified stakeholders who can collaborate with one another to make good use of the telepsychiatry service**; a c**hildren's mental health 'champion' who represents these stakeholders and wants services for their community; and a stable administration that perceives telepsychiatry as valuable for their patients and their doctors. eid: 2-s2.0-77951001593
45. **Children's experiences with chat support and telephone support**
Background: In line with the wider trend of offering support via the Internet, many counseling and referral services for **child**ren have introduced online chat, often in addition to a traditional telephone service. Methods: A comparative study was conducted between the telephone service and the confidential one-on-one online chat service of the Dutch Kindertelefoon. The design included a concise pretest and a posttest (n = 902). The study also comprised a follow-up test (n = 213), which included the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Resul**ts: C**hildren experienced a higher sense of well-being and a reduced severity of their problems after consulting the Kindertelefoon. The results were slightly more favorable for the chat service than for the telephone service. The follow-up survey showed that many** of t**he children who contact the Kindertelefoon suffer from relatively severe emotional problems. Conclusions: Both the telephone and the web-based support i**mprov**ed the children's well-being and decreased their perceived burden of problem. The results of this study underline the need for closer coop**erati**on between child helplines an**d men**tal health and child welfare services**.  20**09 Association for Child and **Adolesc**ent Mental Health. eid: 2-s2.0-70349564761
46. **Pediatric telepsychiatry in Ontario: Caregiver and service provider perspectives**
Families in **rural** areas face significant geographic and economic obstacles to obtaining pediatric **mental health servic**es. Telepsychiatry promises the possibility of extending specialized expertise into areas that have no resident psychiatrists. In this study, user perspectives and experiences of a pediatric telepsychiatry program serv**ing r**ural communities in Ontario, Canada, were explored. Qualitative, exploratory methods were utilized because of the complex nature** of mental health se**rvices needs and provi**sion **in rural communities. Focus **group**s wit**h rural mental healt**h service providers and interviews with family caregivers of **child**ren receiving a telepsychiatry consultation were conducted. The purpose of this research was to evaluate the benefits and limitations of providing pediatric psychiatric services via video-technology to inform future program development and health policy. Whereas participants in the study indicated that their experiences with the telepsychiatry service had been positive, the need for additional local services to support treatment recommendations was emphasized.  2006 National Council for Community Behavioral Healthcare. eid: 2-s2.0-33744504216
47. **Experience with a rural telepsychiatry clinic for children and adolescents**
Access to **child** and **adolesc**ent psychiatric services in many **rural** areas is limited by lack of physicians and long travel times**. A c**hild **and ado**lescent telepsychiatry clinic that is part of the University of Kansas Medical Center's telemedicine program addresses this problem by linking the medical center with a county mental health center** in r**ural Pittsburg, Kansas. The clinic receives ten to 18 visits a week and has been able to serve severely di**sturb**ed c**hildr**en and children in crisis. The quality of clinical interactions in the telepsychiatry clinic appears comparable to that in face- to-face meetings. eid: 2-s2.0-0032907876
48. **A retrospective analysis of a child and adolescent eMental health program**
OBJECTIVE: New models of psychiatric intervention are needed to improve the accessibility of mental health care in the primary care setting, particularly in **rural** areas of the United States and especially for **child**ren and **adolesc**ents. The aim of this study was to examine the diagnostic characteristics and outcomes **for c**hildren referred for eMental Health consultations at UC Davis (videoconferencing, telephone, and secure e-mail) from 10 primary care clinics** in r**ural northern California. METHOD: A retrospective analysis was conducted on the diagnostic and clinical outcomes of 139 r**eferr**ed children who received a full psychiatric diagnostic evaluation via videoconferencing. Within the group, a convenience sample of 58 initial and 41 three-mont**h fol**low-up Child Behavior Checklists (CBCLs) was collected. RESULTS: Comprehensive eMental Health programs appear to be effective for psychiatric diagnosis an**d ass**essment of children. Attention deficit (36.2%) and mood (28.1%) disorders were the most common diagnostic grou**pings** overall. Most children were seen only once, but a statistically significant improvement between initial evaluation and 3-month follow-up in the convenience sample was seen in the Affect and Oppositional domains of the CBCL for girls and boys, respectively.

49. **Telepsychiatry with incarcerated youth**
Purpose: Incarcerated **adolesc**ents have a high prevalence of psychiatric disorders but lack psychiatrists to provide ongoing care. Telepsychiatry may provide one solution to treating this underserved population. Methods: Interactive video conferencing was used to connect a minimum security correctional facility with a regional telemedicine program. Clinical records were reviewed to examine utilization, demographics, diagnoses, pharmacotherapy, and patient **satisfact**ion. Results: During the 29-month study period, 115 youth were treated using 275 telepsychiatry visits. Substance-use, behavioral, and emotional disorders were highly prevalent. Eighty percent (80%) of the youth were successfully prescribed medications. Youth expressed confidence with the psychiatrist's recommendations but expressed concerns about privacy. Conclusions: Telepsychiatry can successfully deliver services to incarcera**ted ado**lescents with a wide range of psychiatric needs. A patient-centered approach that directly a**ssesses** adolescen**ts' satis**faction is recommended to ensure youths' optimal involvement in needed services.  2006 **Society** for Adolescent Medicine. eid: 2-s2.0-33646766442
50. **Evolution of telepsychiatry to rural sites: changes over time in types of referral and in primary care providers' knowledge, skills and satisfaction**
Introduction: **Rural** populations remain underserved in terms of psychiatric services. This study assesses changes over time in the utilization of telepsychiatric services by individual primary care providers (PCPs) and clinics** in r**ural areas, specifically: (a) types of referrals for telepsychiatry service; (b) PCPs' knowledge and skills related to medication dosing; and (c) PCPs' **satisfact**ion with telepsychiatry. Methods: Data with regard to patient demographics, diagnoses, reason for consultation, medication dosing **and satis**faction were prospectively collected on the first 200 and the subsequent 200 telepsychiatric initial consultations. A **number** of educational interventions were implemented during the project. Results: Adult patients were primarily referred for mood and anxiety disorders, particularly for diagnosis and medication treatment planning. Over time, PCPs significantly improved medication dosing and asked for more treatment planning help**. PCPs' s**atisfaction also improved over time. Discussion: Telepsychiatric consultation, in combination with specific educational interventions, appears to facilitate the enhancement of skills and knowledge of PCPs. "Developmental" steps in provider and clinic evolution, along with interventions specific to a given provider's and a given site's needs, ought to be further elucidated.  2006 Elsevier Inc.

51. **Effectiveness of a telehealth service delivery model for treating attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: A community-based randomized controlled trial**
Objective To test the effectiveness of a telehealth service delivery model for the treatment of **child**ren with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) that provided pharmacological treatment and caregiver behavior training. Method **The C**hildren's ADHD Telemental Health Treatment Study (CATTS) was a randomized controlled trial w**ith 2**23 children referred by 88 primary care providers (PCPs) in 7 c**ommun**ities. Children randomized to the experimental telehealth service model received 6 sessions over 22 weeks of combined pharmacotherap**y, de**livered by **child psychiatri**sts through videoconferencing, and caregiver behavior training, provided in person by community therapists who were s**uperv**ised remotely. Children randomized to the control service delivery model received treatment with their PCPs augmented with a telepsychiatry consultation. Outcomes were diagnostic criteria for ADHD and oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) and role performance on the Vanderbilt ADHD Rating Scale (VADRS) completed by caregivers (VADRS-Caregivers) and teachers (VADRS-Teachers) and impairment on the Columbia Impairment Scale-Parent Version (CIS-P). Measures were completed at 5 assessments** over** 25 weeks. Results Children in bo**th se**rvice models improved. Children assigned to the telehealth service model i**mprov**ed significantly more than children in the augmented primary care arm for VADRS-Caregiver criteria for inattention (2[4] = 19.47, p &lt;.001), hyperactivity (2[4] = 11.91, p =.02), combined ADHD (2[4] = 14.90, p =.005), ODD (2[4] = 10.05, p =.04), and VADRS-Caregiver role performance (2 [4] = 12.40, p =.01) and CIS-P impairment (2[4] = 20.52, p &lt;.001). For the** VADR**S-Teacher diagnostic criteria, children in the telehealth service model had significantly more improvement in hyperactivity (2[4] = 11.28, p =.02) and combined ADHD (2[4] = 9.72, p =.045). Conclusion The CATTS trial demonstrated the effectiveness of a telehealth service model to treat ADHD in communities with limited access to specialty **mental health servic**es.

52. **Child and adolescent telepsychiatry: Utilization and satisfaction**
Access to psychiatric care for **child**ren and **adolesc**ents is limited outside of urban areas. Telepsychiatry provides one mechanism to bring needed services to youth. This investigation examines whether telepsychiatry could be successful in providing needed services. Using interactive video teleconferencing at 384 kilobits per second, psychiatrists based at a regio**nal c**hildren's hospital provided consultation and management services to patients at 4 sites across Washington State located 75-150 miles f**rom t**he children's hospital. Twelve-month review of billing records provided utilization data. Surveys of parents' **satisfact**ion over 12 months examined whether parents would accept and be satisfied with the care render**ed to** their children. Over the study year, 387 telepsychiatry visits were provided to 172 youth 2-21 years old with a mean of 2.25 visits per patient. The demographic and diagnostic profile of this sample was consistent with usual outpatient mental health samples. Parents endorsed high satisfac**tion **with their children's telepsychiatric care, with an indication of increas**ing satis**faction upon return appointments. Parents demonstrated some diffe**rential s**atisfaction, tendin**g to high**er satisfaction wit**h the**ir school-aged children's** care and** lower satisfaction with th**eir ado**lescents' care. Telepsychiatry off**ered **through a regional children's hospital was well utilized and parents were **highl**y satisfied with their children's care. The stage is now set for integrating telepsychiatry into a system of care that meets youths' overall needs and for controlled studies demonstrating the efficacy of telepsychiatry with youth.

53. **Using technology to deliver mental health services to children and youth: A scoping review**
Objective: To conduct a scoping review on the use of technology to deliver **mental health servic**es to **child**ren and youth in order to identify the breadth of peer-reviewed literature, summarize findings and identify gaps. Method: A literature database search identified 126 original studies meeting criteria for review. Descriptive numerical summary and thematic analyses were conducted. Two reviewers independently extracted data. Results: Studies were characterized by diverse technologies including videoconferencing, telephone and mobile phone applications and Internet-based applications such as email, web sites and CD-ROMs. Conclusion: The use of technologies plays a major role in the delivery** of mental health se**rvices and supports** to c**hildren and youth in providing prevention, assessment, diagnosis, counseling and treatment programs. Strategies are growing exponentially on a global basis, thus it is critical to study the impact of these technolo**gies **on child an**d youth mental healt**h service delivery. An in-depth review and synthesis of the quality of fndings of studies on effectiveness of the use of technologies in service delivery are also warranted. A full systematic review would provide that opportunity.  Canadian** Acad**emy of Child and **Adolesc**ent Psychiatry. eid: 2-s2.0-84900805289
54. **Cost evaluation of a telepsychiatry service in northern Queensland**
We conducted a simple comparison of the costs associated with delivering a **mental health servic**e by telepsychiatry and by conventional methods. The telepsychiatry **rural** outreach service was delivered to a mining town 900 km from the regional hospital in Townsville. When the telemedicine service was well established, 40 cases a month were seen for general adult psychiatry, four for **child** and **adolesc**ent mental health, four for psychology and two for forensic services. Costs and quality-of-life issues were considered. The savings to the health authority were estimated to be $85,380 in the first year and $112,790 in subsequent years, not allowing for maintenance and equipment upgrading. We also estimated a 40% reduction in patient transfers due to the introduction of telemedicine. Based on the previous year's figures of 27 transfers at $8920 each, this would produce an annual saving of $96,336 for the Royal Flying Doctor Service. The results of the study showed considerable savings from reduced travel by patients and health-care workers. eid: 2-s2.0-0031614471
55. **A prospective satisfaction study and cost analysis of a pilot child telepsychiatry service in Newfoundland**
We evaluated user **satisfact**ion with a PC-based videoconferencing system used for **child** psychiatry assessments and performed a cost analysis. Thirty patients (aged 5-16 years), accompanied by a parent, completed a psychiatric assessment using the videoconferencing system. One of f**ive c**hild psychiatrists was randomly assigned to each assessme**nt. Satis**faction questionnaires were completed after each assessment by the psychiatrist, patient and parent. Parents also completed a cost questionnaire. The telecommunications bandwidth was 336 kbit/s. The psychiatrists stated that they were either 'very satisfied' or 'satisfied' with the telepsychiatry assessments. On a five-point Likert scale (1 = lowest, 5 = highest), 28 of the 30 parents (93%) rate**d their s**atisfaction level as 5; the other two rated it 4. All 30 parents (100%) stated that they 'liked' the telepsychiatry assessment and would use the system again. Twenty-nine parents (97%) indicated that they would prefer to use the telepsychiatry system to travelling t**o see** a **child psychiatri**st in per**son. **Eleven children (aged 5-12) participated and all (100%) said they 'liked' using the telepsychiatry system. F**ive o**ut of nine children (56%) stated they liked the 'television doctor' better than the 'real' doctor; four said they had no preference. Nineteen **adolesc**ents (aged 13-16 years) participated and most were very satisfied or satisfied with the system. Seventeen of the** 19 ado**lescents (89%) said they would prefer to see the psychiatrist on the videoconferencing system to travelling for an assessment, and the same **number** said that they would use telepsychiatry again. The estimated total travel cost for the 30 patients was $12,849, an average of $428 per patient. The total cost of the telepsychiatry service for the three-month pilot was $12,575, or $419 per patient. eid: 2-s2.0-0035235133
56. **Practice parameter for telepsychiatry with children and adolescents**
This practice parameter discusses the use of telepsychiatry to provide services to **child**ren and **adolesc**ents. The parameter defines terms and reviews the status of telepsychiatry as a mode of health service delivery. Because many of the issues addressed are unique to telepsychiatry, the parameter presents principles for establishing a telepsychiatry service and optimizing clinical practice within that service. The principles presented are based on existing scientific evidence and clinical consensus. Telepsychiatry is still evolving, and this parameter represents a first approach to determining "best practices."

57. **A randomized, controlled trial of child psychiatric assessments conducted using videoconferencing**
We used a PC-based videoconferencing system to conduct **child** psychiatry assessments. The telecommunications link was six digital lines, giving a total bandwidth of 336 kbit/s. Twenty-three patients (aged 4-16 years), accompanied by their parents, completed two psychiatric assessments, one via videoconferencing and another face to face (FTF). The order of assessments was randomized. Questionnaires were used to record the diagnosis, treatment recommendations and the psychiatrists', patients' and their parents' **satisfact**ion with each assessment. An independent evaluator concluded that in 22 cases (96%) the diagnosis and treatment recommendations made via the videoconferencing system were the same as those made FTF. The psychiatrists stated that videoconferencing assessments were an adequate alternative to FTF assessments and did not interfere with diagnosis. However, the responses from the psychiatr**ist satis**faction questionnaire showed that they preferred FTF assessments. No significant difference was found in the patients' or p**arents' s**atisfaction responses after the two types of assessment. The majority** of c**hildren (82%) 'liked' using the telepsychiatry system and six (26%) preferred it to a FTF assessment. Most parents (91%) indicated that they would prefer to use the videoconferencing system than to travel a long distance to see a psychiatrist in person. eid: 2-s2.0-19244381817
58. **Lessons learned in a physician referral to pediatric telemental health services program**
Background: This study explores the physician referral and engagement process of a pediatric telemental health program based in a large urban teaching **child**rens hospital, and identifies the processes, strengths and challenges from the perspectives of Primary Care Physicians (PCPs) and telepsychiatrist consultants. Methods: A mixed methods approach was used. This included an online survey completed by 43 PCPs in Ontario **rural** communities who had referred patients to the telemental health program. Qualitative interviews were conducted with** 11 c**hild/**adolesc**ent telepsychiatrists who provide consultations via teleconferencing. Results: The majority of PCPs (61%) reported somewhat to moderate **satisfact**ion with referral experiences. Challenges identified by physicians were related to communication and administration issues including: lack of timely follow-up appointments and continuity of care; lengthy referral forms; and recommendations for **mental health servic**es not accessible in their communities. Similarly, psychiatrist consultants expressed frustration with the sparse information they received from referring physicians and most significantly, the absence of appropriate service providers/professionals during the consultation to provide collateral information and ensure uptake of recommendations. Conclusion: Telemental health programs provide a valuable service to PCPs an**d the**ir child and youth clients that could be significantly enhanced with a different consultation model. Such models of service delivery require protocols to educate PCPs, improve communication and information sharing and establish clear expectations between PCPs and telepsychiatry consultants.  2019, Canadian** Acad**emy of Child **and Ado**lescent Psychiatry.

59. **Clinician perspectives delivering telehealth interventions to children/families impacted by pediatric traumatic brain injury**
Purpose: Technological advances have made the delivery of psychological interventions via web-based platforms increasingly feasible. In recent years, there has been growth in the delivery of psychological interventions through web-based modalities, that is, telepsychology. Although there is evidence supporting the usability and feasibility of telepsychology for a range of populations, there is limited literature on clinician perceptions delivering telepsychology, particularly to pediatric rehabilitation populations. In this mixedmethods study, we report on clinician perspectives and experiences delivering telepsychology to **child**ren/ families impacted by pediatric traumatic brain injury. Method: Seventeen clinicians (psychologists and advanced psychology doctoral students) who delivered telepsychology interventions** to c**hildren/families impacted by pediatric brain injuries completed surveys and interviews. Results: Overall, clinicians reported that telepsychology was equivalent to face-to-face treatment in many regards (e.g., therapeutic alliance, weekly pr**ogres**s, child/family engagement, and establishing rapport). Clinicians reported a **number** of advantages of telepsychology over face-to-face interventions for this pediatric population including greater ease of scheduling, increased understanding of the family and home environments, and less caregiver stigma of behavioral health care. Disadvantages of telepsychology included difficulties reading nonverbal cues, logistical/technological issues, and greater disruptions during sessions. Conclusions: Findings provide an important foundation for future investigations examining the merits of telepsychology versus traditional treatment for both pediatric rehabilitation populations.  2019 American Psychological Association. eid: 2-s2.0-85062274795
60. **Study protocol: A randomised controlled trial of a telephone delivered social wellbeing and engaged living (SWEL) psychological intervention for disengaged youth**
Background: Internationally, from 12.2-23.4% of youth (aged 16-24 years) are not in employment, education or training (NEET). These disengaged youth are more likely to experience social exclusion, increased psychological distress and poor quality of life. Youth at risk of disengagement are less likely to access traditional support services, requiring development of innovative interventions. Methods: The trial is a single blind, three arm, randomised controlled trial evaluating the effectiveness of a telephone delivered psychological intervention for disengaged youth (12-25 years). Participants will be randomised to receive either (i) SWEL, (ii) Befriending, or (iii) Single Session Psycho-Education. Therapy will be over an 8 week period with a minimum of four and maximum of eight sessions for the SWEL or Befriending conditions, or a single session for the Psycho-Education condition. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline and at 2, 8 and 14-month follow-up with the primary outcome being re-engagement in education, training or employment. Discussion: This large, multi-site, randomised controlled trial will inform the delivery of services for young people at risk of disengaging from education or training. The provision of psychological therapy by telephone increases access by youth - especially those in **rural** and remote areas - both to the trial and the treatment, if adopted by services. The outcomes of this trial could have meaningful societal impact for a vulnerable population. It is expected that recruitment, intervention and retention will present challenges for the trial given the focus on disengaged youth. Trial registration: ANZCTR, ACTRN12614001212640, Registered 18 Nov 2014. Retrospectively registered. Ethics and dissemination: Ethics approval has been obtained from the participating institutions. Results of the trial will be submitted for publication in peer reviewed journals and findings presented at scientific conferences and to key service providers and policy makers.  2019 The Author(s). eid: 2-s2.0-85065641912

2. **Risperidone for post-traumatic combat nightmares: A report of four cases**
OBJECTIVE: To report the response to low-dose risperidone in individuals with **combat**-related post-traumatic **stress** disorder (PT**SD) co**mbat nightmares. DESIGN: **Case** series. SETTING: Veterans Affairs Medical Center Mental Health Clinic and collaborative VA-U.S. Army Fort Bragg Warrior Transition Telepsychiatry Clinic. PRACTICE DESCRIPTION: Veterans at the VA; **soldier**s that have severe medical and mental health problems in the Warrior Transition Telepsychiatry Clinic. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): No response: no change in frequency and/or severity of nightmares; **partial** response: decrease in frequency and/or severity of nightmares; full response: total cessation of recall of nightmares. RESULTS: The four individuals included one active d**uty sol**dier and three veterans, ranging from 40 to 76 years of age. All served in the infantry, each in a di**fferen**t combat theater. Two participants had a reduction in the frequency and severity of nightmares at risperidone 1 mg at night. One veteran with blood alcohol levels greater than 300 mg/mL ha**d a par**tial response with risperidone 3 mg at night. Without active substance abuse, the four individuals had a total cessation of nightmares the first night at a risperidone dose of 2 mg at night. The total cessation of nightmares with risperidone continued despite changes in concurrent antidepressants, anxiolytics, and hypnotics. No medication side effects were reported. CONCLUSION: The use of low-dose risperidone (1-3 mg) at night can reduce the severity and frequency or stop the rec**all of** PTSD combat nightmares in some veterans and acti**ve duty** soldiers. Risperidone may be an effective** medic**ation for combat nightmares of PTSD and merits additional exploration.  2011 American Society of Consultant Pharmacists, Inc.

3. **Utilizing telehealth to support treatment of acute stress disorder in a theater of war: Prolonged exposure via clinical videoconferencing**
Background: Posttraumatic **stress** disorder (PTSD) and ac**ute st**ress disorder are prevalent mental health diagnoses associated with the military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan and are especially significant in service members returning from **combat**. Prolonged **exposur**e (PE) therapy is a highly effective behavioral treatment for these symptoms, and providing this treatment as soon as possible, even in the midst of a soldie**r's co**mbat deployment, has strong potential benefits. Materials and Methods: In the current **case** study, telehealth technology was used to support the delivery of PE therapy to treat a service member diagnosed wit**h **acut****e stress disorder in a war zone. PE was conducted face-to-face on the relatively secure Forward Operating Base for the first half of therapy and via clinical videoconferencing (CV) to the service member's** remot**e combat outpost during the later stages of therapy. The service member exhibited marked improvements in symptoms over 10 sessions. Results: Results are consistent with previous empirical findings and highlight the potential benefits of using telehealth to deliver evidenced-based treatment fo**r trau**matic stress disorders in a war zone. T**his **case study provides a preliminary working model for deliver**ing PE** in a combat environment using multiple delivery systems. Conclusions: Benefits and clinical utility of CV-delive**red exp**osure therapy are discussed, particularly for providers pending future operational deployments (e.g., including members of the military, independent government agencies, and first responders) and for those treating patients in remote locations.

4. **Pilot Assessment and Survey of Syrian Refugees' Psychological Stress and Openness to Referral for Telepsychiatry (PASSPORT Study)**
Background: Given the scarcity of mental health resources available for refugees in areas of conflict, it is imperative to investigate interventions that would be accepted by the refugees. Materials and Methods: In this study we surveyed 354 Syrian refugees using the HAD**Stress** screening tool and asked about their **open**ness to referral to psychiatry and telepsychiatry. Results: Of the surveyed sample, 41.8% had scores on** HADSt**ress that correlate to posttr**aumati**c stress disorder. However, only 34% of the whole sample reported a perceived need to see a psychiatrist, and of those only 45% w**ere **open to telepsychiatry. Conclusions: Women, those who were bilingual, and those with **positi**ve HADStress status were less likely to accept telepsychiatry; however, this finding did not reach statistical significance. This study reports a **partial** acceptance of Syrian refugees for telepsychiatric services despite the high prevalence o**f psyc**hological stress.

0. **Information Technologies: An Augmentation to Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Treatment among Trauma Survivors**
This review article presents existing research describing how information technologies can be used to improve mental health services for trauma survivors, either by enhancing existing treatment approaches or as a stand-alone means of delivering trauma-relevant interventions. The potential ways in which technology aids in overcoming barriers to care are first addressed in terms of providing mental health treatment. The use of technologies enables shifting the locus of care from the traditional provider's office to mobile, online, and virtual environments which are less threatening for patients with post-traumatic **stress** disorder (**PTSD**), helping to overcome the core nature of the illness which includes avoidance and increased personal isolation. We then outline how different technological tools can be used for key therapeutic tasks and conclude by discussing key emergent issues that are shaping current and future use of electronic technologies as part of the continuum of care for trauma-related disorders such** as **PTSD.

1. **EPA guidance on eMental health interventions in the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)**
The aim of this EPA guidance was to develop recommendations on eMental health interventions in the treatment of **posttraumat**ic **stress** disorder (**PTSD**). A systematic literature search was performed and 40 articles were retrieved and assessed with regard to study characteristics, applied technologies, therapeutic approaches, diagnostic ascertainment, efficacy, sustainability of clinical effects, practicability and acceptance, attrition rates, safety, clinician-supported vs. non-supported interventions and active vs. waiting-list controls. The reviewed studies showed a great heterogeneity concerning study type, study samples, interventions and outcome measures. Based on these findings, five graded recommendations dealing with symptom reduction, acceptability, type of administration, clinician support, self-efficacy and coping were developed.  2017 Elsevier Masson SAS eid: 2-s2.0-85013750745
2. **RCT of a brief phone-based CBT intervention to improve PTSD treatment utilization by returning service members**
Objectives: Many service members do not seek care for mental health and addiction problems, often with serious consequences for them, their families, and their communities. This study tested the effectiveness of a brief, telephone-based, cognitive-behavioral intervention designed to improve treatment engagement among returning service members who screened positive for **posttraumat**ic **stress** disorder (**PTSD**). Methods: Service members who had served in Operation Enduring Freedom or Operation Iraqi Freedom who screened positive **for **PTSD but had not eng**aged** in PTSD treatment were recruited (N=300), randomly assigned to either control or intervention conditions, and administered a baseline interview. Intervention participants received a brief cognitive-behavioral therapy intervention; participants in the control condition had access to usual services. All participants received follow-up phone calls at months 1, 3, and 6 to assess symptoms and service utilization. Results: Participants in both conditions had comparable rates of treatment eng**agem**ent and PTSD symptom reduction over the course of the six-month trial, but receiving the telephonebased intervention accelerated service utilization (treatment engagement and number o**f se**ssions) and PTSD symptom reduction. Conclusions: A one-time brief telephone intervention can engage** ser**vice members in PTSD treatment earlier than conventional methods and can lead to immediate symptom reduction. There were no differences at longer-term follow-up, suggesting the need for additional intervention to build upon initial gains.  2014, American Psychiatric Association.

3. **Posttraumatic stress disorder treatment for operation enduring freedom/operation iraqi freedom combat veterans through a civilian community-based telemedicine network**
Background: Telemedicine holds great potential to improve access to care and to reduce barriers to treatment for military populations with **posttraumat**ic **stress** disorder (**PTSD**). This study sought to integrate the use of telemedicine mental health treatment services by a community healthcare provider to military populations residing in a rural location and to compare the equivalency of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) administered via telemedicine and traditional face-to-face therapy. Subjects and Methods: Study subjects were men or women 18 years of age or older who had served in Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and/or Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and were diagnosed w**ith **PTSD. The 18 study subjects were randomized and provided 10 weekly therapy sessions of CBT. Pre- and post-intervention assessments were conducted using the Clinician Admin**iste**red PTSD Scale (CAPS), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), Life Events Checklist, and SF-36v2 (QualityMetric, Lincoln, RI) Health Survey. Results: The CAPS, HAM-A, and MADRS each demonstrated lower scores, signifying improvement, and 69% of subjects experienced a clinically significant change in the CAPS. Patient satisfaction results indicated greater satisfaction for telemedicine as opposed to traditional face-to-face treatment. Conclusions: Findings reveal a trend expressing the equivalence of telemedicine and face-to-face therapy when treating OEF/OIF ve**tera**ns with PTSD among rural populations by a community provider. It further demonstrates the successful collaboration between a community healthcare provider and the military healthcare system. Copyright  2014, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-84900027015
4. **Relative efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy administered by videoconference for posttraumatic stress disorder: A six-month follow-up**
Until recently, only one study was published on cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) of **posttraumat**ic **stress** disorder (**PTSD**) in individual therapy via videoconference (Germain, Marchand, Bouchard, Drouin, &amp; Guay, 2009); however, it only assessed the posttreatment effect. This study presents the follow-up of Germain et al.'s (2009) study. The main goal was to compare the effectiveness after six months of CBT**for **PTSD either face-to-face (n = 24) or by videoconference (n = 12). Each participant received CBT for 16 to 25 weeks and completed various questionnaires before and after treatment and at a six-month follow-up. The two treatments had equivalent levels of symptom reduction (M**odif**ied PTSD Symptom Scale: 2 &lt; 0.01, p &gt;.05) and proportion of patients with a clinically significant change in symptoms (42% for face-to-face vs. 38% for videoconferencing, p &gt;.05). T**hus,** CBTfor PTSD via videoconference seems to be a viable alternative when adequate face-to-face treatments are less available.

5. **Telepsychology for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder: A systematic review**
The effectiveness of psychological services provided remotely, telepsychology, for the management of **Posttraumat**ic **Stress** Disorder (**PTSD**) was evaluated. Eleven studies (n = 472 participants) were identified from electronic database searches. Study quality was assessed, with studies characterised by small and underpowered samples. Effect sizes and associated confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to determine the direction and magnitude of treatment change. Short-term treatment gains were reported for internet and video-based interventions. This included significant medium to large improvements (d range = 0.663.22) in cognitive and behavioural symptoms of depression, generalised anxiety and posttrauma**tic st**ress. However, the equivalence of telepsychology and face-to-face psychotherapy could not be determined, with few comparative studies available. Both treatment gains and deterioration were noted 1 to 6 months following treatment cessation, although this was based on limited follow-up data. Further larger scale and longitudinal research will help to ascertain the minimum requirements for the management and treatment** of **PTSD in a technology-supported environment.  2015,  The Author(s) 2015. eid: 2-s2.0-84936874287
6. **Are Community Studies of Psychological Trauma's Impact Accurate? A Study Among Jews and Palestinians**
We evaluated the accuracy of **posttraumat**ic **stress** disorder (**PTSD**) and major depression (MD) diagnoses using brief assessment instruments conducted by pho**ne. **PTSD and MD were assessed by telephone interview in a randomly selected sample of Jewish and Palestinian residents of Jerusalem (N = 150) during a period of marked threat of terrorism and war. We utili**zed **the PTSD Symptom Scale Interview Format (Foa, Riggs, Dancu, & Rothbaum, 1993) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9; Kroenke, Spitzer, & Williams, 2001). We then conducted in-depth, in-person interviews within 2 weeks**, as**sessing PTSD and MD using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI; Kessler et al., 2004). Th**e pr**evalence of PTSD and MD diagnosis ascertained by the 2 assessment modalities was similar. Indices of classification accuracy for the phone interview, using the in-person interview as the standard, ranged from modest to high. Brief phone and in-depth in**-per**son measures of PTSD and MD also correlated similarly with other demograph**ic, st**ress, and coping factors, suggesting convergent validity. Brief phone interviews appear useful for estimating the prevalence of psychological disorders in mass casualty contexts and may have a critical role in both epidemiologic work and guiding public health interventions.  2011 American Psychological Association. eid: 2-s2.0-80052649535
7. **Randomized controlled equivalence trial comparing videoconference and in person delivery of cognitive processing therapy for PTSD**
Introduction: In an effort to improve access to and utilization of health care, the **Veteran**s Health Administration (VHA) continues to investigate the effectiveness of video-teleconferencing (VTC) technologies for service delivery. While previous research focused on the efficacy of VTC treatment for post-traumatic **stress** disorder (**PTSD**) in Vietnam **era vet**erans, few studies have evaluated the efficacy of this modality and treatment for the Iraq/Afghanis**tan era** veterans. The aim of this randomized clinical trial was to evaluate equivalence between in person and VTC psychotherapy **for **PTSD in this newer cohor**t. Meth**ods: Veterans of the Iraq/Afghanistan conflict from two VHA hospitals in the United States were recruited and randomized to receive cognitive processing therapy (C**PT) **for PTSD either in person (IP) or over VTC. Clinician-administered and self-report measures were collected before, during, and after treatment. Results: A trend was observed which suggested that CPT over VTC may be equivalent to the treatment delivered in person, as suggested by previous studies. Regardles**s of tr**eatment, veterans who received the intervention in both conditions reported significant decreases on post-treatment measures. Discussion: This study highlighted research and clinical challenges in providing ser**vices t**o the newest veteran generation in general as well as unique challenges with VTC. One complicating factor to the statistical power of this study was a treatment dropout rate twice the original estimate. Factors that could have influenced this high dropout rate are explored.  2015,  The Author(s) 2015. eid: 2-s2.0-84971468403
8. **Telemedicine: A cost-reducing means of delivering psychotherapy to rural combat veterans with PTSD**
Background: Although effective psychotherapies for **posttraumat**ic **stress** disorder (**PTSD**) exist, high percentages of **Veteran**s in need of services are unable to access them. One particular challenge to providing cost-effective psychological treatments** to Vet**erans w**ith **PTSD involves the difficulty and high cost of delivering in-person, specialized psychothe**rapy to** Veterans residing in geographically remote locations. The delivery of these services via clinical videoteleconferencing (CVT) has been presented as a potential solution to this access to care problem. Materials and Methods: This study is a retrospective cost analysis of a randomized controlled trial investigating telemedicine service delivery of an anger management therapy for Vetera**ns w**ith PTSD. The parent trial found that the CVT condition provided clinical results that were comparable to the in-person condition. Several cost outcomes were calculated in order to investigate the clinical and cost outcomes associated with the CVT delivery modality relative to in-person delivery. Results: The CVT condition was significantly associated with lower total costs compared with the in-person delivery condition. The delivery of mental health services via **CVT ena**bles Veterans who would not normally receive these services access to empirically based treatments. Additional studies addressing long-term healthcare system costs, indirect cost factors at the patient and societal levels, and the use of CVT in other geographic regions of the United States are needed. Conclusions: The results of this study provide evidence that CVT is a cost-reducing mode of service delivery to Ve**tera**ns with PTSD relative to in-person delivery.

9. **BEHAVIORAL ACTIVATION and THERAPEUTIC EXPOSURE for POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER: A NONINFERIORITY TRIAL of TREATMENT DELIVERED in PERSON VERSUS HOME-BASED TELEHEALTH**
Objective Combat **veteran**s returning to society with impairing mental health conditions such as **PTSD** and major depression (MD) report significant barriers to care related to aspects of traditional psychotherapy service delivery (e.g., stigma, travel time, and cost). Hence, alternate treatment delivery methods are needed. Home-based telehealth (HBT) is one such option; however, this delivery mode has not been compared to in person, clinic-based care **for **PTSD in adequately powered trials. The present study was designed to compare relative noninferiority of evidence-based psychotherap**ies **for PTSD and MD, specifically Behavioral Activation and Therapeutic Exposure (BA-TE), when delivered via HBT versus in person, in clinic delivery. Method A repeated measures (i.e., baseline, posttreatment, 3-, 6-month follow-up) randomized controlled design powered for noninferiority analyses was used** to **compare PTSD and MD symptom improvement in response to BA-TE delivered via HBT versus in person, in clinic conditions. Participants were **232 vet**erans diagnosed with full criteria or predefin**ed s**ubthre**shol**d PTSD. Results PTSD and MD symptom improvement following BA-TE delivered by HBT was comparable to that of BA-TE delivered in person at posttreatment and at 3- and 12-month follow-up. Conclusion Evidence-**base**d psychotherapy for PTSD and depression can be safely and effectively delivered via HBT with clinical outcomes paralleling those of clinic-based care delivered in person. HBT, thereby, addresses barriers to care related to both logistics and stigma.  2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-84964643214
10. **Therapist adherence and competence with manualized cognitive-behavioral therapy for PTSD delivered via videoconferencing technology**
Using secondary analyses from a randomized trial comparing the effectiveness of manualized cognitive-behavioral therapy for **posttraumat**ic **stress** disorder, we compared ratings of therapist competency and adherence between two service delivery modes: telepsychiatry (TP) and same room (SR). Patients were 38 male treatment-seeking **veteran**s recruited fro**m a vet**erans affairs medical center. Domains of therapist competence and adherence included structuring sessions, implementing session activities, providing feedback, dealing with difficulties, developing rapport, and conveying empathy. Only one difference emerged between the two treatment conditions, with more favorable ratings on this item in the TP condition. Findings suggest that therapist competence and adherence to cognitive-behavioral therapy is similar whether the treatment is delivered via TP or by traditional means, and TP does not compromise therapists' ability to effectively structure sessions or build rapport with patients. These data further support the use of TP to address shortages in access to mental health care.  2007 Sage Publications. eid: 2-s2.0-34848840294
11. **Effectiveness of cognitive behavioural therapy administered by videoconference for posttraumatic stress disorder**
Telehealth, or health care via videoconferencing, constitutes a clinical option that makes it possible to treat patients remotely. A growing number of studies have demonstrated that telehealth is a feasible and effective method for diagnostic interviews and psychiatric consultations. However, few studies have assessed the effectiveness of psychotherapy given by videoconference. This study examines the effectiveness of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) administered by videoconference for **posttraumat**ic **stress** disorder (**PTSD**). Forty-eight participants w**ith **PTSD were recruited for the study: 16 in the videoconferencing condition and 32 in a control face-to-face condition. Each participant received CBT for 16 to 25 weeks and completed various questionnaires before and after treatment. The results show a significant decline in the frequency and severity** of posttra**umatic symptoms after treatment in both conditions. A clinical improvement in overall functioning was also observed. No significant difference was observed in the effectiveness of the two therapeutic conditions. The examination of effect sizes supports these results. A number of clinical implications and certain avenues for future research are discussed. eid: 2-s2.0-61549135353
12. **A randomized trial of telepsychiatry for post-traumatic stress disorder**
We compared the efficacy of telepsychiatry and same-room treatment of combat-related post-traumatic **stress** disorder (**PTSD**) using cognitive behavioural therapy in 14 weekly, 90-min treatment sessions. Of 97 patients referred for study participation, 38 were randomized (17 into telepsychiatry, 21 into same-room), and approximately 25 (the number differed by instrument) had at least one post-baseline assessment. Measures of clinical and process outcomes were examined. No group differences were found on clinical outcomes at threemonth follow-up. Satisfaction with treatment ratings was similar in both groups, with 'strong satisfaction' indicated by **veteran**s in both modalities. Attendance and drop-out were similar in the two groups. The sameroom group reported more comfort in talking with their therapist at post-treatment and had better treatment adherence. The results provide preliminary support for the use of telepsychiatry in the treatment** of **PTSD to improve access to care. eid: 2-s2.0-34548423717
13. **Changes in Coping and Negative Cognitions as Mechanisms of Change in Online Treatment for Rape-Related Posttraumatic Stress Disorder**
Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)based interventions, including those administered via telepsychology, represent **efficaci**ous **posttraumat**ic **stress** disorder (**PTSD**) treatments. Despite demonstrated efficacy, limited research has examined mechanisms of change for CBT. We examined trauma-related cognitions and coping as treatment mechanisms among 46 women who completed a randomized clinical trial of a CBT-based, telepsychology-delivered interactive program for rape survivors. The results indicated that both the interactive program, d = 1.5, and the active control condition, a psychoeducational website, d = 1.4, resulted in large reductions in postt**est **PTSD symptoms. Analysis of residual gain scores showed that reductions in the three types of assessed trauma-related cognitions were strongly related to reduct**ions** in PTSD symptoms among women assigned to the interactive program, rs =.60.79, but only weakly related to symptom reduction among those assigned to active control, rs =.06.31. The results also suggest that increases in trauma-related approach coping were weakly related to re**duct**ions in PTSD symptoms among participants in the interactive program, rs = .16 and .17, but, conversely, decreases in trauma-related approach coping were weakly related t**o re**ductions in PTSD symptoms among those in the active control group, rs =.07 and.28. Reductions in avoidance coping were modestly relat**ed t**o reductions in PTSD symptoms among women in the interactive program, rs =.38 and.38, but **unre**lated to changes in PTSD symptoms among those assigned to the active control, rs =.03 and.05. Implications for future work examini**ng m**echanisms of change for PTSD treatments are discussed.  2019 International Society for Trauma**tic St**ress Studies eid: 2-s2.0-85075531204
14. **Telepsychiatry- based care for the treatment follow-up of iranian war veterans with post- traumatic stress disorder: A randomized controlled trial**
Background: Physical limitations, distance, and time are major obstacles to access to mental health services for **veteran**s and soldiers. This study was aimed at comparing the efficacy of telepsychiatry and face-to-face consultation as methods of treating post-traumatic **stress** disorder (**PTSD**). The comparison was based on treatment costs, access to health services, completion of therapy sessions, and patient satisfaction as variables. Methods: This research was a double blinded clinical trial supported by Tabriz University of Medical Sciences and conducted in 2015 to 2016 in Tabriz, Iran. Totally, 60 patients were included in the study. Through simple randomization, the patients were divided into experimental and control groups, both of whom were treated through face-to-face consultations for the first 3 sessions. Six follow-up sessions were then held remotely with the experimental group and face to face with the control group. Data were collected using a self-designed and reliable questionnaire and entered in SPSS, version 16. Intergroup comparisons were performed using descriptive statistical measures. Finally, the results were tested using the t test method. Results: A significant relationship was found between the use of information technology and increased patient satisfaction, completion of therapy sessions, and reduction in treatment costs; however, no significant difference was found between the groups in terms of reduction in waiting time and access to a psychiatrist. Conclusion: Telepsychiatry is an effective means of delivering mental health services to psychiatric outpatients living in remote areas with limited resources. The results provide preliminary support for the use of telepsychiatry in treat**ing **PTSD and improving access to care.  2019, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences.

15. **Early treatment withdrawal from evidence-based psychotherapy for PTSD: Telemedicine and in-person parameters**
Objective: To determine differences in reported barriers to treatment completion associated with telemedicine vs. in-person delivery of evidence-based treatment for **PTSD** in combat **veteran**s. Method: The present study was derived from two ongoing randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing in-person vs. telemedicine delivery of exposure therapy **for **PTSD. A onetime telephone assessment of participants who dropped out from the treatment phase of these two studies was conducted, with measures focusing on reported reasons for dropout, and perceived comfort and efficacy of the treatment modality. Dichotomous data were analyzed via chi-square and logistic regression; continuous data via ANOVA. Results: Forty-seven of 69 total dropouts participated. There was no difference in rate of dropout between modalities. A greater proportion of participants receiving in-person exposure therapy reported difficulties with logistical aspects of care (e.g., parking), whereas a greater proportion of participants receiving telemedicine therapy reported difficulty tolerating certain **stress**ful aspects of treatment; however, those receiving telemedicine delivered treatment completed more sessions before dropping out. Participants in both conditions reported that they liked and were confident in their therapist Conclusions: Dropout reasons varied according to type of treatment delivery. Recommendations for future research are given in terms of modification of treatment protocol according to delivery modality.  2014, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-84988260168

**Cognit**ive **behavior**al therapy (**CBT**) has burgeoned as the leader in psychosocial treatments for **anxiou**s **child**ren and **adolesc**ents. Despite the established efficacy** of** CBT for **youth** with anxiety, there is a disparity amongst individuals and families in need of services, and accessibility to qualified practitioners who can effectively deliver empirically supported treatments. Additionally, a substantial number** of c**hildren either do not respond at** al**l to CBT or do not achieve sustained improvement. As a result, recent research in the **area **of childhood anxiety disorders focuses on extending treatment **del**ivery of CBT to families who may not have direct access to trained clinicians, and expanding treatment** to y**outh with comorbid conditions and treatment non-responders. This paper provides a preferably brief overview of research on advancements in the delivery** of co**gnit**ive-beha**vioral therapy for **anxio**us youth, discusses practical considerations, and highlights the current state of intervention research in this area. Specifically, the goals of this literature review are to consider innovative** ad**aptations of CBT **for a**nxious youth in the last decade with a particular focus on: (a) computer and Internet-delivered interventions and clinician training platforms; (b) the potential of videoteleconferencing service delivery methods; (c) treatment personalization via modular interventions targeting individual strengths and addressing responsivity to treatment; and, (d) transdiagnostic** appr**oaches for youth with anxiety and comorbid disorders.

1. **Translating Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Anxious Youth to Rural-Community Settings via Tele-Psychiatry**
This study aimed to determine the feasibility of translating **cognit**ive **behavior**al therapy for **anxiou**s **youth** to rural-community settings via tele-psychiatry training. A 20-week group-supervision training program was delivered to ten different groups from different agencies within Northern Ontario. Each group consisted of four to nine clinicians with **child** therapy background not specific to **CBT** (n=78, 51% social workers, 49% other mental health disciplines). Clinicians were each required to treat an anxi**ous y**outh under supervision. Changes in clinician knowle**dge a**nd youth internalizing symptoms were measured. Northern Ontario clinicians showed significant gains on a ch**ild** CBT-related knowledge test (t<inf>(1, 52)</inf>=4.6, p<.001**). Al**though youth treated by these clinicians showed a significant decrease in anxiety symptoms, possible response bias and the lack of a comparison group mandate further studies before generalizing our findings. Nevertheless, training local therapists in anxiety-**foc**used CBT **for c**hildren via a group supervision based tele-psychiatry model appears to be a feasible and well-received approach to knowledge translation to rural settings.  2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York. eid: 2-s2.0-84941258995
2. **Generic versus disorder specific cognitive behavior therapy for socialanxiety disorder in youth: A randomized controlled trial usinginternet delivery**
The study examined whether the efficacy of **cognit**ive **behavior**al treatment for Social Anxiety Disorder for **child**ren and **adolesc**ents is increased if intervention addresses speci**fic co**gnitive **and beha**vioral factors linked to the development and maintenance of SAD in young people, over and above the traditional generic **CBT** approach. Participants were 125 **youth**, aged 817 years, with a primary diagnosis of SAD, who were randomly assigned to gene**ric**** **CBT (CBT-GEN), social anxie**ty ****s**pecific CBT (CBT-SAD) or a wait list control (WLC). Intervention was delivered using a therapist-supported online program. After 12-weeks, participants who **rec**eive**d t**reatment (CBT-SAD or CBT-GEN) showed significantly greater reduction in social anxiety and post-event processing, and greater improvement in global functioning than the WLC but there was no sig**nif**icant** di**fference between CBT-SAD and CBT-GEN on any outcome variable at 12-weeks or 6-month follow-up. Despite significant reductions in anxiety, the majority in both treatment conditions continued to meet diagnostic criteria for SAD at 6-month follow-up. Decreases in social anxiety were associated with decreases in post-event processing. Future research should continue to investigate disorder-specific interventions for SAD in young people, drawing on evidence regarding causal or maintaining factors, in order to enhance treatment outcomes for this debilitating condition.  2016 Elsevier Ltd eid: 2-s2.0-85006141751
3. **Treatment of child anxiety disorders via guided parent-delivered cognitive-behavioural therapy: Randomised controlled trial**
Background: Promising evidence has emerged of clinical gains using guided self-help **cognit**ive-behavioural therapy (**CBT**) for **child** anxiety and by involving parents in treatment; however, the efficacy of guided parent-delive**red** CBT has not been systematically evaluated in UK primary and secondary settings. Aims: To evaluate the efficacy of low-intensity guided parent-de**liv**ered CBT treatments **for c**hildren with anxiety disorders. Method: A total** of 1**94 children presenting with a current anxiety disorder, whose primary carer did not meet criteria for a current anxiety disorder, were randomly allocated to full guided paren**t-d**elivered CBT (four face-to-face and four telephone sessions) or brief guided p**are**nt-delivered CBT (two face-to-face and two telephone sessions), or a wait-list control group (trial registration: ISRCTN92977593). Presence and **sever**ity of child primary anxiety disorder (Anxiety Disorders Interview Sched**ule f**or DSM-IV, child/parent versio**ns), **improvement in child presentation of anxiety (Clinical Global Impression-Improvemen**t sca**le), and change in chi**ld an**xiety symptoms (S**pence** Children's Anxi**ety S**cale, child/parent version and Child Anxiety Impact scale, parent version) were assessed at post-treatment and for those in the two active treatment groups, 6 months posttreatment. Results: Full guid**ed **parent-delivered CBT produced superior diagnostic outcomes compared with wait-list at posttreatment, whereas brief **gui**ded parent-delivered CBT did not: at post-treatment, 25 (50%) **of **those in the full guided CBT group had recovered from their primary diagnosis, compared with 16 (25%) of those on the wait-list (relative risk (RR) 1.85, 95% CI 1.14**-2.**99); and in the brief guided CBT group, 18 participants (39%) had recovered from their primary diagnosis post-treatment (RR = 1.56, 95% CI 0.89-2.74). Level of therapist t**raini**ng and experience was unrelated to child outcome.

4. **The SmartCAT: An m-health platform for ecological momentary intervention in child anxiety treatment**
Introduction: **Cognit**ive **behavior**al therapy (**CBT**) for **child** anxiety, although **efficaci**ous, typically requires 16-20 weekly sessions with a therapist. Br**ief**** C**BT (BCBT; eight sessions) **for c**hild anxiety is promising but may have less favorable outcomes owing to reduced session time. Mobile health (m-health) has the potential **to **improve BCBT efficacy by delivering ecological momentary intervention to engage **youth** in learning** an**d practicing CBT skills in their everyday lives (in vivo). Materials and Methods: We developed an m-health platform entitled SmartCAT (Smartphone-e**nhanc**ed Child Anxiety Treatment). SmartCAT consists of (1) a smartphone application (app) that cu**e**s **y**outh to use the CBT skills taught in sessions, (2) an online portal that allows therapists to monitor skill use, to send cues and treatment-related materials, to** enga**ge youth in real-time via secure messages, and to manage rewards, and (3) a communication protocol that allows real-time bidirectional exchange between the app and the portal. A pilot stud**y wit**h nine youth (9-14 years old) examined the platform's feasib**ili**ty as an adjunct to BCBT. Results: SmartCAT was found t**o b**e capable of supporti**ng BC**BT for child anxiety and received positive feedback from both** ther**apists and youth patients. Patients rated the app as highly usable (mean=1.7 on a 1-7 scale, with 1="easy"). Patients completed 5.36 skills coach entries per session (standard deviation=1.95) and took an average of 3.14 min (standard deviation=0.98 min) to complete the entries. Conclusions: A sm**art**phone app is feasible** with**in CBT for child anxiety. Users found SmartCAT both acceptable and easy to use. Integ**rat**ing an m-health platform with**in BC**BT for **anxiou**s children may facilitate involvement in treatment and dissemination of effective procedures.

0. **Predicting post treatment client satisfaction between behavioural activation for depression delivered either in-person or via home-based telehealth**
Introduction: Treatment engagement, adherence, cancellations and other patient-centric data are important predictors of **treatment **outcom****e. But often these data are only examined retrospectively. In this investigation, we analysed data from a clinical trial focused on innovative delivery of **depress**ion treatment to identify which patients are likely to prefer either in-home or in-person treatment based on pre-treatment characteristics. Methods: Patient satisfaction was assessed in a trial of individuals w**ith dep**ression treated using identical behavioural activation therapy protocols in person or through videoconferencing to the home (N = 87 at post treatment: 42 in-person and 45 in-home participants). The Client Satisfaction Questionnaire was administered at the end of the treatment. A Tobit regression model was used to assess moderation using treatment assignment. Regression lines were generated to model treatment satisfaction as a function of treatment assignment and to identify whether and where the groups intersected. We examined the distributions of the contributing moderators to the subsets of participants above and below the intersection point to identify differences. Results: While no significant differences in patient satisfaction were observed between the two groups, or between patients receiving treatment by different providers, baseline characteristics of the sample could be used to differentiate those with a preference for traditional, in-office care from those preferring in-home care. Discussion: Participants who were more likely to prefer in-home care were characterized by larger proportions of veterans and lower-ranked enlisted service members. They also had more severe symptoms at baseline and less formal education. Understanding client reactions when selecting treatment modality may allow for a more satisfying patient experience.

1. **Enthusiasm for homework and improvement of psychological distress in subthreshold depression during behavior therapy: Secondary analysis of data from a randomized controlled trial**
Background: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) usually involves homework, the completion of which is a known predictor of a positive **outcom**e. The aim of the present study was to examine the session-by-session relationships between enthusiasm to complete the homework and the improvement of psychological distress in **depress**ed people through the course of therapy. Methods: Working people with subthresh**old dep**ression were recruited to participate in the telephone CBT (tCBT) program with demonstrated effectiveness. Their enthusiasm for homework was enhanced with motivational interviewing techniques and was measured by asking two questions: "How strongly do you feel you want to do this homework?" and "How confident do you feel you can actually accomplish this homework?" at the end of each session. **The ou**tcome was the K6 score, which was administered at the start of each session. The K6 is an index of psychological distress in**cluding** depression and anxiety. We used structural equation modeling (SEM) to elucidate the relationships between enthusiasm and the K6 scores from session to session. Results: The best fitting model suggested that, throughout the course of behavior therapy (BT), enthusiasm to complete the homework was negatively correlated with the K6 scores for the subsequent session, while the K6 score measured at the beginning of the session did not influence the enthusiasm to complete the homeworks assigned for that session. Conclusions: Empirical data now support the practitioners of BT when they try to enhance their patient's enthusiasm for homework regardless of the participant's distress, which then would lead to a reduction in distress in the subsequent week.  2015 Hayasaka et al. eid: 2-s2.0-84947976375
2. **Exploring the relationship between the acceptability of an internet-based intervention for depression in primary care and clinical outcomes: Secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial**
Background: **Depress**ion is one of the most prevalent psychological disorders worldwide. Although psychotherapy **for dep**ression is effective, there are barriers to its implementation in primary care in Spain. The use of the Internet has been shown to be a feasible solution. However, the acceptability of Internet-based interventions has not been studied sufficiently. Objective: To assess the acceptability of an Internet-based intervention (I**BI) for** depression in primary care, and explore the relationship between expectations and satisfaction and the improvement in the clinical variables in primary care patients receiving this intervention. Furthermore, it offers data about the effects of some sociodemographic characteristics on these acceptability variables and analyzes whether the expectations are related to finalizing the intervention. Methods: Data we**re base**d on depressive patients who were participants in a randomized controlled trial. In the present study, we present the data from all the participants in the Internet intervention groups (N = 198). All the participants filled out the expectation and satisfaction scales (six-item scales regarding treatment logic, satisfaction, recommending, usefulness for other disorders, usefulness for the patient, and unpleasant**ness), **the Beck Depression Inventory-II, and the secondar**y outco**me measures: depression and anxiety impairment, and positive and negative affect. Results: Results showed that participants' expectations and satisfaction with the program were both high and differences in expectations and satisfaction depended on some sociodemographic variables (age: older people have higher expectations; sex: women have greater satisfaction). A positive relationship between these variables and intervention efficacy was found: expectations related to usefulness for the patient were a statistically related predictor to the results on the BDI-II (Beta = 0.364), and the perception of how logical the treatment is (Beta = 0.528) was associated with change in the clinical variable. Furthermore, the higher the expectations, the higher the improvements exhibited by the patients in all measures evaluated during the ten intervention modules. High expectations were also directly related to finalizing the intervention. Conclusions: This is the first study in Spain to address this issue i**n the f**ield of IBIs for depression in primary care. The IBI showed high acceptance related to the intervention's efficacy and completion. Research on IBI acceptability could help to implement the treatment offered.

3. **Telephone-based cognitive behavioural therapy for female patients 1-year post-bariatric surgery: A pilot study**
Objective: Although bariatric surgery is a durable treatment for patients with severe obesity, it does not directly address behavioural and psychological factors that potentially contribute to weight regain post-surgery. Psychological interventions, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), can be challenging to access due to physical limitations and practical barriers. Telephone-based CBT (Tele-CBT) can improve eating psychopathology and psychological distress before and after surgery. Given the frequent occurrence/recurrence of problematic eating-related and psychological issues many patients face 1-year post-surgery, this open-trial pilot study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of Tele-CBT delivered 1-year post-surgery as an adjunctive treatment to the usual standard of bariatric care. Methods: Patients (n = 43) received six 1-h Tele-CBT sessions delivered weekly beginning at 1-year post-surgery. Patients completed questionnaire packages before and after the intervention to assess changes in binge eating (BES), emotional eating (EES), **depress**ion (PHQ-9), and anxiety (GAD-7). Results: Thirty-two patients completed Tele-CBT yielding a 74.4% completion rate. Participants reported significant improvements on the Binge Eating Scale (t(31) = 3.794, p = 0.001), Emotional Eating Scale (t(31) = 3.508, p = 0.001), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 Item Scale (z = 2.371, p = 0.018), and Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 Item Scale (z = 3.546, p < 0.001) immediately following Tele-CBT. Discussion: The results demonstrate that Tele-CBT delivered 1-year post-surgery may improve binge eating, emotional eati**ng, dep**ression, and anxiety. Additional research is warranted to examine whether these changes translate into long-term improvements in bariatric surgery **outcom**es.  2019 Asia Oceania Association for the Study of Obesity eid: 2-s2.0-85070292051
4. **A Two-Tiered Strategy for Preventing Complications of Bereavement in the First Thirteen Months Post-Loss: A Pilot Study Using Peer Supports with Professional Therapist Back-up**
This feasibility and acceptance pilot study for preventing complications of bereavement within the first year post loss recruited 20 adult grievers within 9 months of becoming bereft and assigned consenting subjects to peer supporters trained by a non-profit bereavement support organization for weekly or bi-weekly telephone-based peer support until month 13 post-loss. Subjects who met DSM-5 criteria for **major** **depress**ive disorder or showed an Inventory of Complicated Grief (ICG) score exceeding 19, 6 months or more post loss, were assigned to 12 to 16 weeks of interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) with an experienced therapist. Eight and six subjects completed the protocol assigned to peer support and IPT, respectively, with pre/post Patient Health Questionnaire-9 scores of 5.38 (2.45) versus 3.25 (4.13) (p = 0.266) and 16.67 (7.17) versus 8.40 (5.73) (p =0.063); and pre/post ICG scores of 12.50 (4.72) versus 5.00 (2.51) (p = 0.016) and 35.17 (5.12) versus 8.4 (5.73) (p = 0.063). Implications of this two-tiered model of early intervention for preventing complications of grief are discussed.  2017 American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry eid: 2-s2.0-85030571254
5. **Pregnancy and the Acceptability of Computer-Based Versus Traditional Mental Health Treatments**
Background: Recent recommendations urge increased **depress**ion screening in pregnant and postpartum women, potentially increasing demand for treatment. Computer-based psychotherapy treatments may address some of perinatal women's unique mental health treatment needs and barriers. Materials and Methods: We conducted a quantitative survey of pregnant women (12 weeks of gestation) on preferences regarding computer-based therapies compared with traditional therapies (psychotherapy and medication). Nonpregnant women and men served as comparison groups. Participants were provided descriptions of three computer-based therapies: Video telehealth therapy (VTT), computer-assisted therapy (CAT), and self-guided online therapy (SGO). Participants were asked to select all options that they would consider for treatment as well as first choice preference. The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) assessed curr**ent dep**ressive symptomatology, and the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) assessed psychiatric history. Results: Participants included pregnant females (n = 111), nonpregnant females (n = 147), and males (n = 54). Among pregnant women, 77.5% (n = 86) indicated that they would consider some form of computer-based therapy for mental health treatment during pregnancy; VTT was the most commonly considered, followed by CAT and SGO. When asked to select their preferred intervention, traditional talk therapy was the first choice among all three groups, controlling for treatment history and PHQ-9 score. About one-third of pregnant women chose some form of computer-based therapy as their top choice. Conclusions: While computer-based therapies were acceptable to most pregnant women in this sample, traditional talk therapy was the preferred option. Future research should consider how to tailor computer-based therapies to the unique needs of perinatal women.  2017, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-85031664085
6. **A positive psychology intervention for patients with bipolar depression: a randomized pilot trial**
Background: There are few effective treatments for bipolar **depress**ion, a common and debilitating illness. Aims: We aimed to examine the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a four-week, telephone-delivered positive psychology (PP) intervention for patients with bipo**lar dep**ression. Methods: Twenty-five patients hospitalized for **bipolar** depression were randomized to receive a PP (n = 14) or control condition (CC; n = 11) intervention. Following discharge, participants completed weekly exercises and phone calls with a study trainer. PP intervention feasibility was assessed by the number of exercises completed, and acceptability was examined on five-point Likert-type scales of ease and utility. Between-group differences on psychological constructs at 4 and 8weeks post-enrollment were assessed using mixed effects regression models. Results: Participants in the PP group completed an average of three out of four PP exercises and found PP exercises to be subjectively helpful, though neither easy nor difficult. Compared to CC, the PP intervention led to trends towards greater improvements in positive affect and optimism at follow-up, with large effect sizes (modified Cohens d = 0.951.24). PP had variable, non-significant effects on negative psychological constructs. Conclusions: Larger, randomized trials are needed to further evaluate the efficacy of this intervention in this high-risk population.  2018,  2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group. eid: 2-s2.0-85048582203
7. **Common Factors and Depressive Symptom Relief Trajectories in Group Teletherapy for Persons Ageing with HIV**
Telepsychology research has focused primarily on treatment efficacy, with far less attention devoted to how common factors relate to teletherapy **outcom**es. This research identified trajectories of **depress**ive symptom relief in 105 older people living with HIV with eleva**ted dep**ressive symptoms enrolled in a randomized clinical trial testing two 12-session group teletherapies and compared common factors (e.g., therapeutic alliance and group cohesion)** across** depressive symptom trajectory groups. Growth mixture modellin**g of we**ekly depression scores i**dentifi**ed three depressive symptom change groups: (1) early improvers (31%) who rep**orted r**eductions in depressive symptoms by Session 4; (2) delayed improvers (16%) whose symptoms improved after Session 5 and (3) non-improvers (53%). Therapeutic alliance was unrelated to **treatm**ent ou**tcom**e group. Group cohesion was greater in early improvers than non-improvers. Group cohesion was unexpectedly lower, and group member similarity was greater in delayed improvers than non-improvers. Early improvers had been living with HIV/AIDS for fewer years than non-improvers. In group teletherapy, group cohesion and group member similarity are more important than clienttherapist alliance. Copyright  2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Key Practitioner Message: In group teletherapy with older people living with HIV (OPLWHIV), three** laten**t outcome trajectory groups emerged over the 12-week treatment period: (1) non-improvers (53%); (2) early improvers (31%) and (3) delayed improvers (16%). In group teletherapy with OPLWHIV, group cohesion is **a stron**ger predictor of depressive symptom relief than is clienttherapist alliance. OPLWHIV in group teletherapy who do not respond to treatment until the latter therapy se**ssions **can still experience depressive symptom relief comparable with early responders.

8. **Effect of psychotherapy for depression via home telehealth on glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes: Subgroup analysis of a randomized clinical trial**
Objective: We evaluated the impact of telemedicine-delivered behaviour activation treatment (BAT) on glycemic control in a subgroup of older adults with diabetes who participated in a randomized controlled trial for **depress**ion. Research design and methods: We randomized older adults with ma**jor dep**ression to same-room or telemedicine BAT. Each group received eight weekly sessions. For the subgroup analysis, we identified individuals with type 2 diabetes and obtained hemoglobin A1c at baseline and 12 months follow-up. We used mixed-effects models (MEM) for repeated measures analysis to compare the longitudinal mean A1c. We estimated model-derived mean A1c values and considered an adjusted model to account for baseline health status. Results: We included 90 individuals with type 2 diabetes of the original 241 in the subgroup analysis (43 in telemedicine and 47 in same room). Treatment groups were not significantly different at baseline for demogr**aphics,** depression, anxiety or A1c levels (telemedicine 6.9 vs. same room 7.3, p = 0.19). Baseline mean A1c for the telemedicine group remained at 6.9 (55 mmol/mol) at 12 months, whereas baseline mean A1c for the same-room group increased to 7.7 (61 mmol/mol). Longitudinal trajectories of model-derived mean A1c indicated a significant main effect of treatment group on mean A1c value at study end (difference = 0.82, 95% CI 1.41, 0.24). Adjusted analyses gave comparable results. Conclusions: Telemedicine-delivered BAT was superior to same room in achieving lower mean A1c values in participants with type 2 diabetes, suggesting BAT-delivered via telemedicine is a viable treatment option for adults with diabetes.

9. **Predictors of persistence of comorbid generalized anxiety disorder among veterans with major depressive disorder**
Objective: A limited number of randomized clinical trials show that **efficaci**ous pharmacologic treatments exist for comorbid **major** **depress**ive disorder (MDD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). The aims of this effectiveness study were to describe the impact o**f a dep**ression care management intervention on the persistence of comorbid GAD symptoms in a sample of primary care patients with MDD and to identify risk factors for persistent GAD. Method: Data were collected from April 2003 to September 2005 for the Telemedicine-Enhan**ced Ant**idepressant Management (TEAM) study, a multisite, randomized effectiveness trial targeting US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) primary care pa**tients **with depression. Veterans aged 26.59-88.36 years received either the TEAM intervention or usual care in small VA community-based outpatient clinics. The TEAM care management intervention focused on** optimi**zing antidepressant therapy through patient education and activation, symptom monitoring, adherence promotion, and side-effect management. Veterans who screened positive for MDD using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (based on DSM-IV criteria) and who met the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview criteria (maintaining consistency with DSM-IV-TR) for comorbid GAD at baseline were selected for the present study (N = 168). The primary **outcom**e was persistence of GAD at 6 months and 12 months. All predictors available in the TEAM study data that were described in the literature to be associated with influencing **GAD ou**tcomes were examined. Resu**lts: Pe**rsistence of depression was the strongest predictor of persistence of comorbid GAD at both 6 months (OR = 5.75; 95% CI, 2.38-13.86; P < .05) and 12 months (OR = 15.56; 95% CI, 6.10-39.68; P < .05). Although the TEAM interventio**n signi**ficantly reduced depression symptom severity, it was not significantly associated with GAD persistence. Insomnia was a significant protective factor for persistence of GAD at 6 months (OR = 0.66; 95% CI, 0.44-0.99; P < .05). Conclusions: Early screening for presence of comorbid GAD among those with MDD may be valuable both for further research and for enhancing clinical management of GAD and MDD comorbidity.

10. **Counselling versus low-intensity cognitive behavioural therapy for persistent sub-threshold and mild depression (CLICD): A pilot/feasibility randomised controlled trial**
Background: Persistent **depress**ive symptoms below the threshold criteria for ma**jor dep**ression represent a chronic condition with high risk of progression to a diagnosis o**f **major**** depression. The evidence base for psychological treatments such as Person-Centred Counselling and Low-Intensity Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for su**b-thres**hold depressive sy**mptoms **and mild depression is limited, particularly for longer-term **outcom**es. Methods: This study aimed to test the feasibility of delivering a randomised controlled trial into the clinical and cost effectiveness of Low-Intensity Cognitive Behavioural Therapy versus Person-Centred Counselling for patients with persi**stent s**ub-threshold depre**ssive s**ymptoms and mild depression. The prim**ary ou**tcome measures for this pilot/feasibility trial were recruitment, adherence and retention rates at six months from baseline. An important se**condar**y outcome measure was recov**ery fro**m, or prevention of, depression at six months assessed via a structured clinical interview by an independent assessor blind to the participant's treatment condition. Thirty-six patients were recruited in five general practices and were randomised to either eight weekly sessions of person-centred counselling each lasting up to an hour, or up to eight weeks of cognitive-behavioural self-help resources with guided telephone support sessions lasting 20-30 minutes each. Results: Recruitment rate in relation to the number of patients approached at the general practices was 1.8 %. Patients attended an average of 5.5 sessions in both interventions. Retention rate for the 6-month follow-up assessments was 72.2 %. Of participants assessed at six months, 71.4 % of partic**ipants **with a diagnosis of mild depression at baseline had recovered, while 66.7 % with a d**iagnosi**s of persistent subthreshold depress**ion at **baseline had not develope**d **m**ajor depress**ion. There were no significant differences between treatment** groups** for both recovery and prevention of depression at six months or on** any o**f the outcome measures. Conclusions: It is feasible to recruit participants and successfully deliver both interventions in a primary care** settin**g to patients with subthreshold and mild depression; however recruiting requires significant input at the general practices. The evidence from this study suggests that short-term Person-Centred Counselling and Low-Intensity Cognitive Behaviour Therapy are potentially effective and their effectiveness should be evaluated in a larger randomised controlled study which includes a health economic evaluation.

11. **The Sleep Or Mood Novel Adjunctive therapy (SOMNA) trial: A study protocol for a randomised controlled trial evaluating an internet-delivered cognitive behavioural therapy program for insomnia on outcomes of standard treatment for depression in men**
Background: Insomnia is a significant risk factor for **depress**ion onset, can result in more disabl**ing dep**ressive illness, and is a common residual symptom following treatment cessation that can increase the risk of relapse. Internet-based cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia has demonstrated efficacy and acceptability to men who are less likely than women to seek help in standard care. We aim to evaluate whether internet delivered cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia as an adjunct to a s**tandard** depression therapeutic plan can lead to improved mood **outcom**es. Methods/Design: Male participants aged 50 years or more, meeting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders criteria for cu**rrent M**ajor Depressive Episode and/or Dysthymia and self-reported insomnia symptoms, will be screened to participate in a single-centre double-blind randomised controlled trial with two parallel groups involving adjunctive internet-delivered cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia and an internet-based control program. The trial will consist of a nine-week insomnia intervention period with a six-month follow-up period. During the insomnia intervention period participants **will ha**ve their depression management coordinated by a psychiatrist using stand**ard gui**deline-based depression treatments. The study will be conducted in urban New South Wales, Australia, where 80 participants from primary and secondary care and direct from the local community will be recruited. The prim**ary ou**tcome is ch**ange in** the severity of depressive symptoms from baseline to week 12. Discussion: This study will provide evidence on whether a widely accessible, evidence-based, internet-delivered cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia intervention can lead to greater improvements **than st**andard treatment for depression alone, in a group who traditionally do not readily access psychotherapy. The study is designed to establish effect size, feasibility and processes associated with implementing e-health solutions alongside standard clinical care, to warrant undertaking a larger more definitive clinical trial.

12. **Occupational impact of internet-delivered cognitive behaviour therapy for depression and anxiety: Reanalysis of data from five Australian randomised controlled trials**
Objective: To determine whether internet-delivered cognitive behaviour therapy (iCBT) for **depress**ion and anxiety reduces self-reported absenteeism in employed individuals.Design, participants and setting: We reanalysed data from five randomised controlled trials of iCBT: two **for dep**ression (conducted from September 2008 to February 2009 and from June 2009 to January 2010), two for generalised anxiety disorder (conducted from March 2009 to June 2009 and from July 2009 to January 2010) and one for social phobia (conducted from May 2008 to July 2008). Participants across Australia were recruited via a website. The inclusion criteria were: (i) meets criteria for the disorder of interest; (ii) aged 18 years or over; (iii) no previous history of a psychotic disorder or drug or alcohol misuse; (iv) not actively suicidal. The iCBT courses each consisted of six online lessons (to be completed within 11 weeks), homework assignments, automatic emails and resource documents.Main **outcom**e measure: The number of days absent (self-reported absenteeism) in the previous week.Results: We included 284 participants in our analysis. When data for the three disorders were combined, participants who received iCBT had significant reductions in self-reported absenteeism compared with those in the control groups (who were on a waitlist) (P = 0.03). When data for the three disorders were analysed separately, reductions in self-reported absenteeism for participants who received iCBT were not significantly different to those for participants in the control groups.Conclusion: Using data from five RCTs, we showed that iCBT was associated with reductions in self-reported absenteeism. Future research should focus on replicating these findings in other contexts, such as other disorders and other iCBT courses.  2014, Australasian Medical Publishing Co. Ltd.

13. **A Scenario-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Mobile App to Reduce Dysfunctional Beliefs in Individuals with Depression: A Randomized Controlled Trial**
Introduction: While self-administered mobile app-based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has shown efficiency and effectiveness over the past decade, attempts to address automatic and negative beliefs have been lacking. The purpose of this study was to introduce and verify a mobile app that directly intervenes in dysfunctional thoughts. This app-based treatment includes recognizing automatic and negative thoughts of the protagonist of scenarios, writing advice directly to the main character, and sharing advice provided by other participants. Materials and Methods: Thirty-four participants diagnosed with Other Specified **Depress**ive Disorder were recruited and randomly allocated to a CBT-based mobile-app program, the Todac Todac (TT group), or a daily mood chart app program (control group). Participants were asked to use the software for 3 weeks. Assessments for autonomic thoughts and clinical symptoms were administered at baseline and at a follow-up evaluation. Results: After completing the 3-week program, Dysfunctional Attitude Scale (DAS) scores in TT group were lower than they were in the control group. In clinical measures, both TT group and control group showed reduced B**eck Dep**ression Inventory-II (BDI-II) scores and situation-dependent trait version of State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-X2) at follow-up. However, TT group showed significantly reduced STAI-X2 scores compared to control group. For all participants, changes in DAS scores were correlated with BDI-II and STAI-X2 scores. Conclusions: Our preliminary findings provide promising evidence that scenario-based CBT mobile apps can be used to deliver feasible and **efficaci**ous cognitive therapy. Long-term research is needed to determine the impact and effectiveness of this new treatment format.  Copyright 2018, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2018. eid: 2-s2.0-85053678284
14. **Telephone-administered psychotherapy in combination with antidepressant medication for the acute treatment of major depressive disorder**
Background Telephone-administered psychotherapies (T-P) provided as an adjunct to anti**depress**ant medication may improve response rates in ma**jor dep**ressive disorder (MDD). The goal of this study was to compare telephone-administered social rhythm therapy (T-SRT) and telephone-administered intensive clinical management (T-ICM) as adjuncts** to ant**idepressant medication for MDD. A secondary goal was to compare T-P with Treatment as Usual (TAU) as adjunctive treatment to medication for MDD. Methods 221 adult out-patients with MDD**, curre**ntly depressed, were randomly assigned to 8 sessions of weekly T-SRT (n=110) or T-ICM (n=111), administered as an adjunct to agomelatine. Both psychotherapies were administered entirely by telephone, by trained psychologists who were blind to other aspects of treatment. The 221 patients were a posteriori m**atched **with 221 depressed outpatients receiving TAU (controls). The primary **outcom**e measure was the percentage of responders at 8 weeks post-treatment. Results No significant differences were found between T-SRT and T-ICM. But T-P was associated with higher response rates (65.4% vs 54.8%, p=0.02) and a trend toward higher remission rates (33.2% vs 25.1%; p=0.06) compared to TAU. Limitations Short term study. Conclusions This study is the first assessing the short-term effects of an add-on, brief, telephone-administer**ed psyc**hotherapy in depressed pa**tients **treated with antidepressant medication. Eight sessions of weekly telephone-delivered psychot**herapy **as an adjunct to antidepressant medication resulted in improved response rates relative to medication alone. eid: 2-s2.0-84944809872
15. **Trajectory of cost overtime after psychotherapy for depression in older Veterans via telemedicine**
Background Little evidence exists regarding the costs of telemedicine, especially considering changes over time. This analysis aimed to analyze trajectory of healthcare cost before, during, and after a behavioral activation intervention delivered via telepsychology and same-room delivery to elderly Veterans with **depress**ion. Methods 241 participants were randomly assigned into one of two study groups: behavioral activation **for dep**ression via telemedicine or via same-room treatment. Patients received 8 weeks of weekly 60-min individual sessions of behavioral activat**ion for** depression. Primary **outcom**es were collected at 12-months. Inpatient, outpatient, pharmacy, and total costs were collected from VA Health Economics Resource Center (HERC) datasets for FY 19982014 and compared between the two treatment groups. Generalized mixed models were used to investigate the trajectories over time. Results Overall cost, as well as, outpatient and pharmacy cost show increasing trend over time. Unadjusted and adjusted trajectories over time for any cost were not different between the two treatment groups. There was a significant overall increasing trend over time for outpatient (p<0.001) and total cost (p<0.001) but not for inpatient (p=0.543) or pharmacy cost (p=0.084). Limitations Generalizability to younger, healthier populations may be limited due to inclusion criteria for study participants. Conclusion Healthcare costs before, during, and after intervention did not differ between the telemedicine and in-person delivery methods. Outpatient costs accounted for most of the increasing trend of cost over time. These results support policies to use both telehealth and in-person treatment modalities to effectively and efficiently provide high quality care.  2016 Elsevier B.V. eid: 2-s2.0-85007545283
16. **Telephone-based care management for older adults initiated on psychotropic medication**
Objective This study aimed to explore the longitudinal, 6-month symptom course of older adults newly started on an anti**depress**ant or anxiolytic by non-psychiatrist physicians and enrolled in a care management program. Method This is a naturalistic cohort study of older adults (age 65 years) receiving pharmacotherapy and telephone-based care management. Participants are non-institutionalized adults participating in Pennsylvania's Pharmaceutical Assistance Contract for the Elderly who completed telephone-based clinical assessments including demographic data, self-report on history of psychiatric treatment and adherence, and standardized symptom scales. Results A total of 162 participants with an average age of 77.2 years (SD 6.8) were followed and, for analysis, split into two groups by PHQ-9 score: 75 (46.3%) scoring 0-4 (minimally symptomatic group, MSG) and 87 (53.7%) scoring 5 (symptomatic group, SG). Over 6 months, the SG improved with PHQ-9 scores beginning on average at 10.0 (SD 4.6) and falling to 5.4 (SD 4.2) (F(1, 86) = 29.53, p &lt; 0.0001). The MSG had no significant change** in dep**ressive symptoms. Emotional health as measured by SF-12 Mental Composite Score mirrored the PHQ-9 change and lack thereof in the SG and MSG, respectively. No clinical or demographic features were associated with symptom improvement in the SG although they were more likely to report medication adherence (66.7% vs. 44.0%, 2(1) = 8.4, p = 0.0037) compared with the MSG. Conclusions Participation of symptomatic older adults initiated on psychotropic medication in a telephone-based care management program was associated with improve**ment in** depressive symptoms and overall emotional well-being, notable findings given participants' advanced age, state-wide distribution, and history of limited utilization of mental health care.  2012 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. eid: 2-s2.0-84874702662
17. **The second randomised evaluation of the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and acceptability of computerised therapy (REEACT-2) trial: Does the provision of telephone support enhance the effectiveness of computer-delivered cognitive behaviour therapy? a randomised controlled trial**
Background: Computerised cognitive behaviour therapy (cCBT) is an efficient form of therapy potentially improving access to psychological care. Indirect evidence suggests that the uptake and effectiveness of cCBT can be increased if facilitated by telephone, but this is not routinely offered in the NHS. Objectives: To compare the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of telephone-facilitated free-to-use cCBT [e.g. MoodGYM (National Institute for Mental Health Research, Australian National University, Canberra, ACT, Australia)] with minimally supported cCBT. Design: This study was a multisite, pragmatic, open, two-arm, parallel-group randomised controlled trial with a concurrent economic evaluation. Setting: Participants were recruited from GP practices in Bristol, Manchester, Sheffield, Hull and the north-east of England. Participants: Potential participants were eligible to participate in the trial if they were adults with **depress**ion scoring  10 on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Interventions: Participants were randomised using a computer-generated random number sequence to receive minimally supported cCBT or telephone-facilitated cCBT. Participants continued with usual general practitioner care. Main **outcom**e measures: The prim**ary ou**tcome was self-reported symptoms** of dep**ression, as assessed by the PHQ-9 at 4 months post randomisation. Se**condar**y outcomes**: Seco**ndary outcom**es were** depression at 12 months and anxiety, somatoform complaints, health utility (as assessed by the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions questionnaire) and resource use at 4 and 12 months. Results: Clinical effectiveness: 182 participants were randomised to minimally supported cCBT and 187 participants to telephone-facilitated cCBT. There was a difference in the **severit**y of depression at 4 and 12 months, with lower levels in the telephone-facilitated group. The odds of **no long**er being depressed (defined as a PHQ-9 score of < 10) at 4 months were twice as high in the telephone-facilitated cCBT group [odds ratio (OR) 2.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.23 to 3.42]. The benefit of telephone-facilitated cCBT was no longer significant at 12 months (OR 1.63, 95% CI 0.98 to 2.71). At 4 months the between-group difference in PHQ-9 scores was 1.9 (95% CI 0.5 to 3.3). At 12 months the results still favoured telephone-facilitated cCBT but were no longer statistically significant, with a difference in PHQ-9 score of 0.9 (95% CI-0.5 to 2.3). When considering the whole follow-up period, telephone-facilitated cCBT was asssociated with significantly lower PHQ-9 scores than minimally supported cCBT (mean difference-1.41, 95% CI-2.63 to-0.17; p = 0.025). There was a significant improvement in anxiety scores over the trial period (between-group difference 1.1, 95% CI 0.1 to 2.3; p = 0.037). In the case of somatic complaints (assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-15), there was a borderline statistically significant difference over the trial period (between-group difference 1.1, 95% CI 0.0 to 1.8; p = 0.051). There were gains in quality-adjusted life-years at reduced cost when telephone facilitation was added to MoodGYM. However, the results were subject to uncertainty. Conclusions: The results showed short-term benefits from the addition of telephone facilitation to cCBT. The effect was small to moderate and comparable with that of other primary care psychological interventions. Telephone facilitation should be considered whe**n offer**ing cCBT for depression.

18. **Cross-cultural aspects of depression management in primary care**
**Major** **depress**ive disorder (MDD) is a prevalent illness in minority populations. Minority patients with MDD are often unrecognized and untreated. This review examines promising interventions to address MDD in primary care settings, where minority groups are more likely to seek care. Since 2010, eleven interventions have been developed to address patient-specific and provider-specific barriers, many of which are adaptations of the collaborative care model. Other promising interventions include cultural tailoring of the collaborative care model, as well as the addition of telepsychiatry, motivational interviewing, cultural consultation, and innovations in interpreting. Overall, collaborative care was found feasible and improved satisfaction and treatment engagement** of dep**ressed minority patients in primary care. It remains inconclusive whether these newer intervention models improve MDD **treatment **outcom****es. Future research will be needed to establish the effectiveness of these intervention models in improving **the treatment ou**tcomes of minority populations with MDD.

19. **The effectiveness of Telepsychiatry-Based culturally sensitive collaborative treatment for depressed Chinese American immigrants: A randomized controlled trial**
Objective: This study evaluates the effectiveness of a telepsychiatry-based culturally sensitive collaborative treatment (T-CSCT) intervention to improve **treatment **outcom****es for **depress**ed Chinese American immigrants. Methods: Participants were Chinese Americans recruited from primary care settings from February 1, 2009, to July 31, 2012, with DSM-IV ma**jor dep**ressive disorder (MDD) identified by the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview. Eligible patients were randomized to receive either T-CSCT or treatment as usual (TAU) for 6 months. T-CSCT involves (1) cultural consultation via videoconference and (2) care management. The prim**ary ou**tcome measure was the 17-item H**amilton** Depression Rating Scale (HDRS17); positive response was defined as a  50% decrease in HDRS17 score, and remission was defined as HDRS17 score  7. Se**condar**y outcome measures were the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness (CGI-S) and Improvement (CGI-I) scales and the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire** (Q-LE**S-Q). Outcomes were compared using multivariate logistic regression and mixedmodel for repeated measures methods. Results: Among participants (N = 190), 63% were female, and the mean (SD) age was 50 (14.5) years. They were randomized to T-CSCT (n = 97; 51%) or TAU (n = 93; 49%). Using multivariate logistic regression analyses, the odds of achieving response and remission were significantly greater for the T-CSCT group compared to the control group (odds ratio [OR] = 3.9 [95% CI, 1.9 to 7.8] and 4.4 [95% CI, 1.9 to 9.9], respectively). Multivariate general linear model analyses showed that patients in the T-CSCT group had significantly greater improvement over time in HDRS17 (F4,95 = 4.59, P = .002), CGI-S (F4,95 = 4.22, P = .003), and CGI-I (F4,95 = 2.95, P = .02) scores. Conclusions: T-CSCT is effective in improv**ing treatment ou**tcomes of Chinese immigrants with MDD.  2016 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-84989325589
20. **Depression program in primary health care: The chilean experience**
Chile is a middle income country in the process of demographic transition, where mental health problems contribute significantly to the disease burden. In 2001, Chile introduced gradually the Program of Treatment for **Depress**ion in Primary Health Care (PTDPHC), which includes a multicomponent care model according to the severity of the medical profile: integral evaluation by a team of professionals, **antidep**ressant drug treatment, individual psychotherapy, psychoeducational group intervention, and monitoring visits. In 10 years of operation, this program has attended more than 1 million adults. We have conducted several evaluations of this program, and our results show that PTDPHC is effective in dec**reasing** depressive symptoms and comorbidity, has positive effects on the patient and their partners, and is independent of the center; the greatest threat to achieving effectiveness is the rate of treatment dropout. In the future, the manager of this policy must meet the following challenges: the continuous training of primary care teams, the incorporation of techniques that have been shown to improve compliance, and the extension of coverage to remote areas, where telepsychiatry could be a good idea.  2012 M.E.

21. **CTN-194 (PICCO): Design of a trial of citalopram for the prevention of depression and its consequences in HIV-Hepatitis C co-infected individuals initiating pegylated interferon/ribavirin therapy**
Hepatitis C (HCV)-related end stage liver disease is a primary cause of morbidity and mortality in people with HIV. Despite this, co-infected patients have low rates of HCV treatment initiation and completion. This is in large part due to the risk of pegylated-interferon alpha (PEG-IFN-)-related neuropsychiatric complications. We describe the design of a multicentre randomized, placebo-controlled trial that evaluates whether anti**depress**ant prophylaxis is superior to early detection and treatment** of dep**ression in increasing the successful completion of HCV therapy. Seventy-six HIV+ adults with chronic HCV infection requiring therapy and with no contraindications to PEG-IFN-/ribavirin will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive citalopram or placebo starting three weeks prior to HCV treatment. A novel aspect of the trial design is the built-in management of e**mergent** depression while maintaining the blinded treatment assignment. This will permit the comparison of prophylactic versus therapeutic use of citalopram. The primary **outcom**e is the average proportion of prescribed PEG-IFN- and ribavirin doses taken per month at weeks 12 and 24, and will be compared between treatment arms. The study will also compare the development of moderat**e-to-se**vere depression between treatment arms. A unique feature of this trial will be the use of Telepsychiatry to standardize observer-administered neuropsychiatric evaluations. Assessments of anxiety, quality of life, and adherence to therapy, as well as pathogenetic studies of neuropsychiatric side effects, will be conducted. Intention-to-treat analyses using random regression modeling will be employed to analyze longitudinal data on prescribed PEG-IFN- and ribavirin doses. Survival analyses will be used to compare the time to the** develo**pment of depression between the two arms. Effective prevention of a broad range of neuropsychiatric symptoms by citalopram has the potential to diminish PEG-IFN- associated morbidity and consequently, allow a greater number of patients to complete full therapy.  2008 Elsevier Inc.

22. **Psychotherapy for depression in older veterans via telemedicine: Effect on quality of life, satisfaction, treatment credibility, and service delivery perception**
Objective: To analyze the impact of telepsychology and sameroom care on functioning, satisfaction, and perception of care based on a noninferiority trial of psychotherapy delivered via telemedicine or same-room care to elderly patients with **depress**ion. Methods: 241 elderly patients w**ith dep**ression (meeting DSM-IV diagnostic criteria) were randomly assigned to either telemedicine (n = 120) or same-room treatment (n = 121) between April 1, 2007, and July 31, 2011. The primary **outcom**es included quality of life (36-item Short Form Survey [SF-36]), satisfaction (Charleston Psychiatric Outpatient Satisfaction Scale), treatment credibility, and service delivery perception scores obtained at 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 3 months, and 12 months. Comparisons of intervention means were carried out at each time point using independent sample t tests and SAS Procedure MIANALYZE to combine results across the multiply imputed complete data sets. If significant differences were detected for a gi**ven ou**tcome within a domain, a Bonferroni correction was applied to determine if significance was maintained. Results: None of the SF-36 scores showed a significant difference between the 2 treatment groups by the end of the study period, with little significance shown throughout the intermediate time points. Similarly, over all time points, there was no statistically significant difference in patient satisfaction or treatment credibility. Conclusions: This study found that telemedicine is a viable alternative modality for providing evidence-based psychotherapy for elderly patien**ts with** depression. Results provide evidence that quality of life and satisfaction with care are not adversely influenced by the decision to use a telehealth modality instead of in-person treatment, and, as a result, resources can be devoted to offering services in patients' homes through telemedicine.

23. **Patient acceptance of and initiation and engagement in telepsychotherapy in primary care**
Objective: The study examined factors associated with the utilization of psychotherapy offered in primary care via videoconferencing (telepsychotherapy). Methods: Primary care patients with **depress**ion (N5179) recruited from five Federally Qualified Health Centers were randomly assigned to telemedicine-based collaborative care and offered free telepsychotherapy. Independent variables included measures of access to and need for treatment. Logistic regression identified variables associated with acceptability of and initiation and engagement in telepsychotherapy. Results: To 76% of patients the idea of participating in psychotherapy was acceptable. Thirty-eight percent scheduled a telepsychotherapy session, 17% attended a session, and 8% engaged in treatment (attended at least eight sessions). Because the intervention was designed to minimize barriers, access was not a significant predictor of utilization. However, use of telepsychotherapy was associated with measures of perceived need. Conclusions: Evenwhen psychotherapy was delivered in a primary care setting via videoconferencing to minimize barriers, few patients initiated or engaged in telepsychotherapy.

24. **Implementing multifactorial psychotherapy research in online virtual environments (IMPROVE-2): Study protocol for a phase III trial of the MOST randomized component selection method for internet cognitive-behavioural therapy for depression**
Background: **Depress**ion is a global health challenge. Although there are effective psychological and pharmaceutical interventions, our best treatments achieve remission rates less than 1/3 and limited sustained recovery. Underpinning this efficacy gap is limited understanding of how complex psychological interventions **for dep**ression work. Recent reviews have argued that the active ingredients of therapy need to be identified so that therapy can be made briefer, more potent, and to improve scalability. This in turn requires the use of rigorous study designs that test the presence or absence of individual therapeutic elements, rather than standard comparative randomised controlled trials. One such approach is the Multiphase Optimization Strategy, which uses efficient experimentation such as factorial designs to identify active factors in complex interventions. This approach has been successfully applied to behavioural health but not yet to mental health interventions. Methods/Design: A Phase III randomised, single-blind balanced fractional factorial trial, based in England and conducted on the internet, randomized at the level of the patient, will investigate the active ingredients of internet cognitive-behavioural therapy (C**BT) for** depression. **Adults **with depression (operationalized as PHQ-9 score  10), recruited directly from the internet and from an UK National Health Service Improving Access to Psychological Therapies service, will be randomized across seven experimental factors, each reflecting the presence versus absence of specific treatment components (activity scheduling, functional analysis, thought challenging, relaxation, concreteness training, absorption, self-compassion training) using a 32-condition balanced fractional factorial design (2IV 7-2). The primary **outcom**e** is sym**ptoms of depression (PHQ-9) at 12 weeks. Second**ary ou**tcomes include symptoms of anxiety and process measures related to hypothesized mechanisms. Discussion: Better understanding of the active ingredients of **efficaci**ous therapies, such as CBT, is necessary in order to improve and further disseminate these interventions. This study is the first application of a component selection experiment to psychologic**al inte**rventions in depression and will enable us to determine the main effect of each treatment component and its relative efficacy, and cast light on underlying mechanisms, so that we can systematically enhance internet CBT.

25. **A Systematic Review of Videoconference-Delivered Psychological Treatment for Anxiety Disorders**
Objective: Recently, increasing attention has been given to the issue of limited access to evidence-based psychological treatments. Factors affecting access can include geographical distance from service providers, lack of trained specialists, and prohibitive costs for treatment. Videoconferencing provides a convenient, low-cost alternative to in-person psychotherapy. Although videoconferencing treatment has been trialled for a vast array of mental health problems, surprisingly little research has been conducted exploring the efficacy of videoconferencing for the treatment of anxiety disorders. Anxiety disorders are highly prevalent and disabling conditions for which effective psychological treatment exists. The aim of the present study was to determine the state of the evidence with regard to the effectiveness of videoconference-delivered treatment for anxiety disorders. Method: Using preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses guidelines, we conducted a systematic review of all studies that primarily recruited individuals with anxiety disorders, published between 2004 and 2014. Results: We identified 20 studies involving a total of 613 participants. Of the included studies, 50% were uncontrolled and 50% were controlled trials. The **major**ity of studies conducted to date focused on post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD; n=10), followed by obsessive-compulsive disorder (n=5), mixed anxiety and **depress**ion (n=2), panic disorder (n=2), and social phobia (n=1). No studies were located that focused on investigating videoconference-delivered therapy exclusively for generalised anxiety disorder. Conclusions: Findings are discussed in terms of the accumulating evidence for the effectiveness of videoconference-delivered therapy to treat anxiety disorders and the need for more trials overall, but particularly for generalised anxiety disorder.  2015 The Australian Psychological Society. eid: 2-s2.0-84937561177
26. **Acceptance of home-based telehealth problem-solving therapy for depressed, low-income homebound older adults: Qualitative interviews with the participants and aging-service case managers**
Purpose: To report low-income homebound older adults' experience of telehealth problem-solving therapy (tele-PST) and aging-service case managers' (CMs') experience/perception of client-level personal barriers to accessing psychotherapy in general and PST specifically. Design and Methods: The study sample consisted of 42 homebound older adults who participated in the feasibility and efficacy trial of tele-PST and completed 36-week follow-up assessments and 12 CMs of a large home-delivered meals program who referred their clients to the tele-PST trial. In-depth interviews with the older adults and written feedback and focus group discussions with the CMs provided the data. Results: Older adults reported a high rate of approval of PST procedures and acknowledged its positive treatment effect. Tele-PST participants were satisfied with videoconferenced sessions because they were convenient and allowed them to see their therapist. However, CMs reported that only about 10%-20% of potentially eligible older adults gave oral consent for PST. Significant treatment engagement barriers were the older adults' lack of motivation, denial of **depress**ion, perceived stigma, and other personal attitudinal factors. Implications: The real-world implementation of tele-PST or other psychotherapies needs to include educating and motivat**ing dep**ressed homebound elders to recogniz**e their** depression and accept treatment.  2013 The Author. eid: 2-s2.0-84905013447
27. **The effect of telephone-based interpersonal psychotherapy for the treatment of postpartum depression: Study protocol for a randomized controlled trial**
Backgroun d: Substantial data indicate potential health consequences of untreated postpartum **depress**ion (PPD) on the mother, infant, and family. Studies have evaluated interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) as treatment for PPD; however, the results are questionable due to methodological limitations. A comprehensive review of maternal treatment preferences suggests that mothers favor 'talking therapy' as a form of PPD treatment. Unfortunately, IPT is not widely available, especially in rural and remote areas. To improve access to care, telepsychiatry has been introduced, including the provision of therapy via the telephone.Methods/Design: The purpose of this randomized controlled trial is to evaluate the effect of telephone-based IPT on the treatment of PPD. Stratification is based on self-reported history** of dep**ression and province. The target sample is 240 women. Currently, women from across Canada between 2 and 24 weeks postpartum are able to either self-iden**tify as** depressed and refer themselves to the trial or they may be referred by a health professional based on a score >12 on the Edinburg**h Postn**atal Depression Scale (EPDS). Following contact by the trial coordinator, a detailed study explanation is provided. Women who fulfill the eligibility criteria (including a positive diagnostic asses**sment f**or ****major** depress**ion) and consent to participate are randomized to either the control group (standard postpartum care) or intervention group (standard postpartum care plus 12 telephone-based IPT sessions within 12 to 16 weeks, provided by trained nurses). Blinded research nurses telephone participants at 12, 24, and 36 weeks post-randomization to assess for PPD and other** **outcom****es including depressive symptomatology, anxiety, couple adjustment, attachment, and health service utilization. Results from this ongoing trial will: (1) develop the body of knowledge concerning the effect of telephone-based IPT as a treatment option for PPD; (2) advance our understanding of training nurses to deliver IPT; (3) provide an economic evaluation of an IPT intervention; (4) investigate the utility of the EPDS in general clinic**al prac**tice to identify depressed mothers; and (5) present valuable information regarding PPD, along with associated couple adjustment, co-morbid anxiety and self-reported attachment among a mixed rural and urban Canadian population.Trial registration: Current Controlled Trials Ltd.

28. **Use of the internet to assist in the treatment of depression and anxiety: A systematic review**
Objective: This systematic review aims to describe the Internet's potential role in assisting patients with **depress**ion and anxiety. Data Sources: A MEDLINE search was conducted of articles published between 1998 and 2008 using the te**rms dep**ression and anxiety and Internet, comput**ers and** depression and anxiety, Internet and com**pliance** and depression, and Internet an**d adher**ence and depression. Study Selection: Publications cited include articles concerned with the Internet in screening, supporting, educating, and tre**ating p**atients with depression and anxiety. Data Extraction: The efficacy of Internet-**based i**nterventions for depression and anxiety was reviewed, alongside the quality of available online information regarding these disorders. Data Synthesis: Little progress has been made in developing a universally accepted system for quality assurance of medical information Web sites. Furthermore, there is a lack of research describing the effect of self-diagnosis sites on meaningful **outcom**es, such as the proportion of patients who go on to receive suc**cessful** treatment for their depression. Early studies of Internet-based c**ognitiv**e-behavioral therapy for depression were promising; however, results of clinical trials for "e-therapy" have been variable due to methodological issues. A novel compliance** suppor**t Web site for patients with depression and anxiety is being evaluated to establish whether providing such assistance can improve pati**ent ou**tcomes. Conclusions: The use **of the **Internet to assist patients with depression and anxiety is currently in its infancy. However, it appears that the Internet h**as grea**t potential to support patients with depression and may consequently also be of benefit to physicians.  2010 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-78650558740
29. **Telepsychiatry evaluation in the north-west of England: Preliminary results of a qualitative study**
A telepsychiatry referral service for patients suffering from anxiety and **depress**ion was evaluated from a user perspective. Low-cost video-phones linked a psychiatrist to two general practices in the north-west of England. Quantitative data were collected using a semistructured interview schedule. Twenty-two patients and 13 doctors were interviewed after a video-link consultation. Some users were very positive about the service and recognized its potential benefits, while others were more ambivalent. Patients saw the service as a means of obtaining additional 'expert' advice. General practitioners felt that the service might adversely affect the doctor-patient relationship in psychiatry. Both patients and clinicians recognized that the video-link modified normal interaction. Users need to adapt to this form of communication. An induction session is recommended for both patients and clinicians. eid: 2-s2.0-0002345539
30. **A study of the effectiveness of telepsychiatry-based culturally sensitive collaborative treatment of depressed Chinese Americans**
Background: Chinese American patients with **Major** **Depress**ive Disorder (MDD) tend to underutilize mental health services and are more likely to seek help in primary care settings than from mental health specialists. Our team has reported that Culturally Sensitive Collaborative Treatment (CSCT) is effective in improving recognition and treatment engagement** of dep**ressed Chinese Americans in primary care. The current study builds on this prior research by incorporating telemedicine technology into the CSCT model.Methods/Design: We propose a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the acceptability and effectiveness of a telepsychiatry-based culturally sensitive collaborative treatment (T-CSCT) intervention targeted toward Chinese Americans. Patients meeting the study's eligibility criteria will receive either treatment as usual or the intervention under investigation. The six-month intervention involves: 1) an initial psychiatric interview using a culturally sensitive protocol via videoconference; 2) eight scheduled phone visits with a care manager assigned to the patient, who will monitor the patient's progress, as well as medication side effects and dosage if applicable; and 3) collaboration between the patient's PCP, psychiatrist, and care manager. **Outcom**e measures **include** depressive symptom severity as well as patient and PCP satisfaction with the telepsychiatry-based care management service.Discussion: The study investigates the T-CSCT model, which we believe will increase the feasibility and practicality of the CSCT model by adopting telemedicine technology. We anticipate that this model will expand access to culturally competent psychiatrists fluent in patients' native languages to improve t**reatmen**t of depressed minority patients in primary care settings.Trial Registration: NCT00854542.  2011 Yeung et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd. eid: 2-s2.0-80053372067
31. **Pilot randomised controlled trial of Help4Mood, an embodied virtual agent-based system to support treatment of depression**
Introduction: Help4Mood is an interactive system with an embodied virtual agent (avatar) to assist in self-monitoring of patients receiving treatment for **depress**ion. Help4Mood supports self-report and biometric monitoring and includes elements of cognitive behavioural therapy. We aimed to evaluate system use and acceptability, to explore likely recruitment and retention rates in a clinical trial and to obtain an estimate of potential treatment response with a view to conducting a future randomised controlled trial (RCT). Methods: We conducted a pilot RCT of Help4Mood in three centres, in Romania, Spain and Scotland, UK. Patients with diagno**sed dep**ression** (**major**** depressive disorder) and current mi**ld/mode**rate depressive symptoms were randomised to use the system for four weeks in addition to treatment as usual (TAU) or to TAU alone. Results: Twenty-seven individuals were randomised and follow-up data were obtained from 21 participants (12/13 Help4Mood, 9/14 TAU). Half of participants randomised to Help4Mood used it regularly (more than 10 times); none used it every day. Acceptability varied between users. Some valued the emotional responsiveness of the system, while others found it too repetitive. Intention to treat analysis showed a small difference in** change** of Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-2) scores (Help4Mood 5.7 points, TAU 4.2). Post-hoc on-treatment analysis suggested that participants who used Help4Mood regularly experienced a median change in BDI-2 of 8 points. Conclusion: Help4Mood is acceptable to some patients rece**iving t**reatment for depression although none used it as regularly **as inte**nded. Changes in depression symptoms in individuals who used the system regularly reached potentially meaningful levels.  2015,  The Author(s) 2015. eid: 2-s2.0-84983070104
32. **Comorbid Anxiety Disorders and Treatment of Depression in People With Multiple Sclerosis**
Objective: Anxiety is highly comorbid with **depress**ion, but little is known about the impact of anxiety disorders on the effectiveness of empirically supported psychotherapies **for dep**ression. We examined such **outcom**es for people with Multiple Sclerosis (**MS) and** depression, with versus without comorbid anxiety disorders. Design: Participants with MS (N = 102) received 16 weeks of telephone-administered psycho**therapy** for depression and were followed for one year post-treatment. Results: Participants with comorbid anxiety disorders improved to a similar degree during treatment as those without anxiety disorde**rs. Ou**tcomes during follow-up were mixed, and thus we divided the anxiety diagnoses into distress and fear disorders. The distress disorder (GAD) was associated with elevated anxiety symptoms during and after treatment. In contrast, fear disorders (i.e., panic disorder, agoraphobia, social phobia, specific phobia)** were l**inked to depression, specifically during follow-up, across 3 different measures. Conclusions: People with GAD rece**iving t**reatment for depression may benefit from additional services targeting anxiety more specifically, while those with comorbid fear disorders may benefit from services targeting maintenance of gains after treatment.  2010 American Psychological Association. eid: 2-s2.0-77956497074

Objective: The objective of this study was to test the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary clinical **outcom**es of a method to leverage existing home healthcare telemonitoring technology to deliver **depress**ion care management (DCM) to both Spanish- and English-speaking elderly homebound recipients of homecare services. Materials and Methods: Three stand-alone, nonprofit community homecare agencies located in New York, Vermont, and Miami participated in this study. Evidence-based DCM was adapted to the telemonitor platform by programming questions and educational information** on dep**ression sympto**ms, ant**idepressant adherence, and side effects. Recruited patients participated for a minimum of 3 weeks. Telehealth nurses were trained on DCM and received biweekly supervision. On-site trained research assistants conducted in-home research in**terview**s on depression diagnosis and severity and patient satisfaction with the protocol. Results: An ethnically diverse sample of 48 English- and Spanish-only-speaking patients participated, along with seven telehealth nurses. Both patients and telehealth nurses reported high levels of protocol acceptance. Among 19 patients meeting diagnostic cri**teria f**or **major** d**epressi**on, the mean depression severity was in the "markedly severe" range at baseline and in the "mild" range at follow-up. Conclusions: Results of this pilot support the feasibility of using homecare's existing telemonitoring technology to deliver DCM to their elderly homebound patients. This was true for both English- and Spanish-speaking patients. Preliminary clini**cal ou**tcomes** sugges**t improvement in depression severity, although these findings require testing in a randomized clinical trial. Implications for the science and **service** of telehealth-based depression care for elderly patients are discussed.  Copyright 2011, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2011. eid: 2-s2.0-80053250021
34. **Willingness to use telemedicine for psychiatric care**
The aim of this study was to assess potential users' willingness to use telepsychiatry and its correlates within a theoretical framework guided by the principles of social-cognitive models. The conceptual model proposed willingness to use telepsychiatry to be associated directly to attitudes toward telemedicine, attitudes toward the patient-physician relationship, and satisfaction with current medical care, and indirectly to anxiety to technology. Phone interviews were conducted with a representative sample of 1,204 Jewish, noninstitutionalized adults in Israel (mean age = 58; 51% female). Structural equation modeling was used to examine hypothesized relationships. Willingness to use telepsychiatry was relatively high and was affected by the participants' attitudes toward telemedicine, the patient-physician relationship, and by the level of anxiety toward technology. Efforts aimed at encouraging the use of telemedicine for psychiatric care should target potential users' attitudes, as well as feelings of uneasiness and anxiety regarding technology. eid: 2-s2.0-4744357454
35. **Automated depression screening in disadvantaged pregnant women in an urban obstetric clinic**
Objective: A promising means of screening for **depress**ion among high-risk perinatal women involves interactive voice response (IVR) technology in which patients self-enter data into a database using a touch tone telephone. Our aim was to test the feasibility of using IVR to screen **for dep**ression among low-income, urban pregnant patients and to solicit their preferences for treatment. Methods: The study population included a convenience sample of English-speaking pregnant patients awaiting routine prenatal visits in an urban obstetric clinic. Consenting subjects used a phone in a private clinic room to complete an IVR version of the Edinburgh Po**stnatal** Depression Scale (EPDS). Patients scoring **in the **"not depressed" range were branched to a closing message while those with** mild t**o severe depressive symptoms were branched to additional automated questions about their treatment preferences. Results: All 54 participants who consented to the study were able to complete the IVR phone session. More than 90% expressed willingness to complete IVR interviews as part of routine prenatal and postpartum care. Sixteen out of 54 participants (29.6%) scored in the moderate **to seve**re range for depressive symptoms (EPDS  12) which was consistent with a prior study in the same population using a validated paper-pencil screen. **Only 12** out of 21 (57%) depressed subjects indicated a desire to speak with a health care provider about how they are fee**ling. T**he **major**ity of these depressed subjects preferred to speak with a social worker about housing or financial problems (92%) or an obstetrician or midwife (83%), while a minority (42%) wanted to speak with a mental health professional. Conclusions: This pilot study suggests that it is feasible to use an automate**d phone** interview to screen for depression in low-income, urban pregnant women.  2007 Springer-Verlag. eid: 2-s2.0-34547734529
36. **Comparing in-person to videoconference-based cognitive behavioral therapy for mood and anxiety disorders: Randomized controlled trial**
Background: Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) has demonstrated efficacy and effectiveness for treating mood and anxiety disorders. Dissemination of CBT via videoconference may help improve access to treatment. Objective: The present study aimed to compare the effectiveness of CBT administered via videoconference to in-person therapy for a mixed diagnostic cohort. Methods: A total of 26 primarily Caucasian clients (mean age 30 years, SD 11) who had a primary Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition text revision (DSM-IV-TR) diagnosis of a mood or anxiety disorder were randomly assigned to receive 12 sessions of CBT either in-person or via videoconference. Treatment involved individualized CBT formulations specific to the presenting diagnosis; all sessions were provided by the same therapist. Participants were recruited through a university clinic. Symptoms of **depress**ion, anxiety, stress, and quality of life were assessed using questionnaires before, after, and 6 weeks following treatment. Secondary **outcom**es at posttreatment included working alliance and client satisfaction. Results: Retention was similar across treatment conditions; there was one more client in the videoconferencing condition at posttreatment and at follow-up. Statistical analysis using multilevel mixed effects linear regression indicated a significant reduction in client symptoms across time for symptoms** of dep**ression (P<.001, d=1.41), anxiety (P<.001, d=1.14), stress (P<.001, d=1.81), and quality of life (P<.001, d=1.17). There were no significant differences between treatment conditions regarding symp**toms of** depression (P=.165, d=0.37), anxiety (P=.41, d=0.22), stress (P=.15, d=0.38), or quality of life (P=.62, d=0.13). There were no significant differences in client rating of the working alliance (P=.53, one-tailed, d=-0.26), therapist ratings of the working alliance (P=.60, one-tailed, d=0.23), or client ratings of satisfaction (P=.77, one-tailed, d=-0.12). Fisher's Exact P was not significant regarding differences in reliable change from pre- to posttreatment or from pretreatment to follow-up for **symptom**s of depression (P=.41, P=.26), anxiety (P=.60, P=.99), or quality of life (P=.65, P=.99) but was significant for symptoms of stress in favor of the videoconferencing condition (P=.03, P=.035). Difference between conditions regarding clinically significant change was also not observed from pre- to posttreatment or from pretreatment to follow-up **for sym**ptoms of depression (P=.67, P=.30), anxiety (P=.99, P=.99), stress (P=.19, P=.13), or quality of life (P=.99, P=.62). Conclusions: The findings of this controlled trial indicate that CBT was effective in significantly r**educing** symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress and increasing quality of life in both in-person and videoconferencing conditions, with no significant differences being observed between the two. eid: 2-s2.0-84887863626
37. **Evaluating an e-mental health program (deprexis) as adjunctive treatment tool in psychotherapy for depression: Results of a pragmatic randomized controlled trial**
Background **Depress**ive disorders place a significant disease burden on individuals as well as on societies. Several web-based interventions **for dep**ression have shown to be effective in r**educing** depressive symptoms. However, it is not known whether web-based interventions, when used as adjunctive treatment tools to regular psychotherapy, have an additional effect compared to regular psycho**therapy** for depression. Methods Adults (N = 98) with a unipolar affective disorder were recruited in routine outpatient psychotherapy practices in Germany from therapists over the course of their initial sessions and randomized within therapists to one of two active treatment conditions: regular psychotherapy or psychotherapy p**lus a w**eb-based depression program (deprexis). **Primary** **outcom**e was depressive symptoms** measur**ed with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) at 12 weeks. Second**ary ou**tcomes were anxiety symptoms, somatic symptoms and quality of life at 12 weeks and six months follow-up. The study also included an assessment of the working alliance after six and 12 weeks. Results The combination of psychotherapy with the web-based program was more effective than psychotherapy alone at 12 weeks, with medium between-gr**oup eff**ect sizes on primary depressive symptoms (Cohen's d =.51) and small to medium between-group effect sizes on se**condar**y outcomes (Cohen's d =.07.55). Furthermore, we did not observe negative side effects in the blended format, e.g., a lower working alliance than in psychotherapy alone. Limitations The study had a smaller than planned sample size and the dropout rate at follow-up was high. Conclusions This study provides first evidence that the use of a web-based program as an adjunctive tool in regular psychotherapy could be a promising option to c**onsider** in future treatment for depression.  2017 Elsevier B.V. eid: 2-s2.0-85034089945
38. **A randomized controlled trial of telephone-delivered cognitive-behavioral therapy for late-life anxiety disorders**
OBJECTIVES: Older adults face a number of barriers to receiving psychotherapy, such as a lack of transportation and access to providers. One way to overcome such barriers is to provide treatment by telephone. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of cognitive behavioral therapy delivered by telephone (CBT-T) to older adults diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Participants' homes. PARTICIPANTS: Sixty participants age 60 and older with a diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, or anxiety disorder not otherwise specified. INTERVENTION: CBT-T versus information-only comparison. MEASUREMENTS: Coprimary **outcom**es included worry (Penn State Worry Questionnaire) and general anxiety (State Trait Anxiety Inventory). Second**ary ou**tcomes included clinician-rated anxiety (Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale), anxiety sensitivity (Anxiety Sensitivity Index), **depress**ive symptoms (B**eck Dep**ression Inventory), quality of life (SF-36), and sleep (Insomnia Severity Index). Assessments were completed prior to randomization, immediately upon completion of treatment, and 6 months after completing treatment. RESULTS: CBT-T was superior to information-only in reducing general anxiety (ES = 0.71), worry (ES = 0.61), anxiety sensitivity (ES = 0.85), and insomnia (ES = 0.82) at the posttreatment assessment; however, only the reductions in worry were maintained by the 6-month follow-up assessment (ES = 0.80). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that CBT-T may be **efficaci**ous in reducing anxiety and worry in older adults, but additional sessions may be needed to maintain these effects.  2012 American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry. eid: 2-s2.0-84864241378
39. **Use of standard webcam and internet equipment for telepsychiatry treatment of depression among underserved hispanics**
Objective: **Depress**ion affects nearly one in five Americans at some time in their life, causing individual suffering and financial cost. The Internet has made it possible to deliver telemedicine care economically to areas and populations with limited access to specialist or culturally and linguistically congruent care. Methods: This study compared the effectiveness for Hispanic patients** of dep**ression treatment provided by a psychiatrist through Internet videoconferencing (Webcam intervention) and treatment as usual by a primary care provider. Adults (N=167) with a diagn**osis of** depression were recruited from a community clinic and were randomly assigned to treatment condition. Webcam participants met remotely each month with the psychiatrist, and treatment-as-usual patients received customary care from their primary care providers, all for six months. At baseline and three and six months, analyses of variance tested differences between conditions i**n score**s on depression rating scales and quality-of-life and functional ability measures. Results: All participants experienced an** improv**ement in depression symptoms. Ratings on th**e Montg**omery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale by clinicians blind to treatment group and self-ratings on the nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire, Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire, and Sheehan Disability Scale showed a significant main effect of time. On all four measures, a significant interaction of time by intervention favoring the Webcam group was noted. Discussion: Results suggest that telepsychiatry delivered through the Internet utilizing commercially available domestic Webcams and standard Internet and computer equipment is effective and acceptable. Use of this technology may help close the gap in access to culturally and linguistically congruent specialists. Copyright  American Psychiatric Association. eid: 2-s2.0-84878320324
40. **Telemedicine for depression: A systematic review**
PURPOSE. More than 14% of the population has a mood disorder, and more than 50% do not receive treatment. Information and communication technology (ICT) could improve health care. A systematic review was considered in order to know the programs that apply ICT in the management of **depress**ion and to assess their effectiveness. CONCLUSION. There is insufficient scientific evidence regarding the effectiveness of ICT use in the management** of dep**ression. However, there is a well-founded hypothesis that videoconference produces the same results as face-to-face treatment and that self-help Internet programs could improve symptoms. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS. More research is needed; nevertheless, when traditional care is not possible, telemedicine could be used.  2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-77954357632
41. **Design and implementation of the Telemedicine-Enhanced Antidepressant Management Study**
Objective: Evidence-based practices designed for large urban clinics are not necessarily transportable into small rural practices. Implementing collaborative care for **depress**ion in small rural primary care clinics presents unique challenges because it is typically not feasible to employ on-site mental health specialists. The purpose of the Telemedicine-Enhanced **Antidep**ressant Management (TEAM) study was to evaluate a collaborative care model adapted for small rural clinics using telemedicine technologies. The purpose of this paper is to describe the TEAM study design. Method: The TEAM study was conducted in small rural Veterans Administration community-based outpatient clinics with interactive video equipment available for mental health, but no on-site psychiatrists/psychologists. The study attempted to enroll all patient**s whose** depression could be appropriately treated in primary care. Results: The clinical characteristics of the 395 study participants differed significantly from most previous trials of collaborative care. At baseline, 41% were already receiving p**rimary **care depression treatment. Study participants averaged 5.5 chronic physical health illnesses and 56.5% had a comorbid anxiety disorder. Over half (57.2%) reported that pain impaired their functioning extremely or quite a bit. Conclusions: Despite small patient populations in rural clinics, enoug**h patie**nts with depression can be successfully enrolled to evaluate telemedicine-based collaborative care.  2006 Elsevier Inc.

42. **Treatment of Social Anxiety Disorder Using Online Virtual Environments in Second Life**
Over 80% of people with social anxiety disorder (SAD) do not receive any type of treatment, despite the existence of effective evidence-based treatments. Barriers to treatment include lack of trained therapists (particularly in nonmetropolitan areas), logistical difficulties (e.g., cost, time, transportation), concerns regarding social stigma, and fear of negative evaluation from health care providers. Interventions conducted through electronic communication media, such as the Internet, have the potential to reach individuals who otherwise would not have access to evidence-based treatments. Second Life is an online virtual world that holds great promise in the widespread delivery of evidence-based treatments. We assessed the feasibility, acceptability, and initial efficacy of an acceptance-based behavior therapy in Second Life to treat adults with generalized SAD. Participants (n= 14) received 12 sessions of weekly therapy and were assessed at pretreatment, midtreatment, posttreatment, and follow-up. Participants and therapists rated the treatment program as acceptable and feasible, despite frequently encountered technical difficulties. Analyses showed significant pretreatment to follow-up improvements in social anxiety symptoms, **depress**ion, disability, and quality of life, with effect sizes comparable to previously published results of studies delivering in-person cognitive behavior therapy for SAD. Implications and future directions are discussed.  2012. eid: 2-s2.0-84872289268
43. **Feasibility and acceptability of clinic-based telepsychiatry for low-income hispanic primary care patients**
Background: The feasibility and acceptability of telepsychiatry for low-income Hispanic patients with **major** **depress**ion were assessed. Subjects and Methods: In total, 167 adult Hispanic patients with ma**jor dep**ression recruited from a community health center (CHC) were randomly assigned to receive psychiatry services through a video Webcam (WEB) (n=80) or to treatment as usual (TAU) (n=87). The WEB condition consisted of monthly telepsychiatry sessions at the CHC for 6 months provided by one of two Hispanic psychiatrists using an online virtual meeting program. TAU patients received their care from their providers. Acceptability was assessed by comparing appointment keeping for primary care versus telepsychiatry, patients' perceived working alliance with their provider, visit satisfaction, **and ant**idepressant use. Feasibility was ass**essed u**sing depression **outcom**es, functional days (unproductive or days lost), and whether WEB and TAU patients differed in their appointment keeping. Results: WEB patients did not differ in the proportion of completed primary care versus telepsychiatry appointments and rated their working alliance with the psychiatrist and their visit satisfaction significantly higher than the TAU patients with their provider. Significantly more WEB than TAU pa**tients **used antide**pressan**ts. Although depression severity decreased faster among WEB than TAU patients, no differences we**re foun**d in the overall depression score. WEB and TAU patients did not differ in the number of days that were **lost or** unproductive due to depression. Although WEB and TAU patients reported being willing to pay for mental health services provided by the CHC, almost proportionately twice as many WEB patients were willing to pay for telepsychiatry. Conclusions: R**esults **show that for low-income depressed Hispanic p**atients**, telepsychiatry service for depression is acceptable, although its feasibility is questionable. The benefits of telemedicine were discussed in terms of improving patient care in ways other than directly providing services to the patients.

44. **Acceptance based behavior therapy for social anxiety disorder through videoconferencing**
Most individuals with social anxiety disorder (SAD) do not receive any type of treatment. Reasons include logistical barriers (e.g., geographic location, travel time), fear of stigmatization, and fear of the social interactions associated with seeking treatment. Videoconferencing technology holds great promise in the widespread delivery of evidence-based treatments to those who would otherwise not receive treatment. This pilot study assessed the feasibility, acceptability, and initial efficacy of an acceptance-based behavioral intervention using Skype videoconferencing to treat adults with generalized SAD. Twenty-four participants received 12 sessions of weekly therapy and were assessed at pre-treatment, mid-treatment, post-treatment, and 3-month follow-up. Participants and therapists rated the intervention as acceptable and feasible. Analyses revealed significant pre-treatment to follow-up improvements in social anxiety, **depress**ion, disability, quality of life, and experiential avoidance, with effect sizes comparable to or larger than previously published results of studies delivering in-person CBT for SAD.

45. **Clinical outcomes in telepsychiatry**
A retrospective review of patient records comparing clinical **outcom**es of patients seen by interactive television (IATV) and those seen in person was carried out to determine whether IATV reduced the quality of psychiatric care. A Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) score was determined for each patient in both the study and control groups at the initial visit, and at subsequent visits. Forty-nine patients with either **major** **depress**ion or schizoaffective disorder were studied. No significant difference was found in the percentage change in GAF scores between the two groups, which suggests that clini**cal ou**tcomes were not affected by the use of IATV. Patients seen by IATV had a greater attendance rate and follow-up visits took less than half the time compared with in-person visits, indicating that IATV was an acceptable and efficient method of providing psychiatric services. eid: 2-s2.0-0032613658
46. **Long-term benefits of short-term quality improvement interventions for depressed youths in primary care**
Objective: Quality improvement programs for **depress**ed youths in primary care settings have been shown to improve 6-month clinical **outcom**es, but longer-t**erm ou**tcomes are unknown. The authors examined 6-, 12-, and 1**8-mont**h outcomes of a primary care quality improvement intervention. Method: Primary care patients 13-21 years of age with curr**ent dep**ressive symptoms were randomly assigned to a 6-month quality improvement intervention (N=211) or to treatment as usual enhanced with provider training (N=207). The quality improvement intervention featured expert leader teams to oversee implementation of the intervention; clinical care managers trained in cognitive-behavioral ther**apy for** depression to support patient evaluation and treatment; and support for patient and provider choice of treatments. Results: The quality improvement intervention, relative to enhanced treatment as usual, lowered the likelihoo**d of se**vere depression (Center for Epidemio**logical** Studies Depression Scale score 24) at 6 months; a similar trend at 18 months was not statistically significant. Path analyses revealed a significant indirect intervention **effect **on long-term depression due to the initial intervention improvement at 6 months. Conclusions: In this randomized effectiveness trial of a primary care quality impro**vement **intervention for depressed youths, the main effect of the inte**rventi**on on outcomes was to decrea**se the **likelihood of severe depression** at th**e 6-month outcome assessment. These early intervention-related improvements conferred additional long-term protection through a favorable shift in illness course through 12 and 18 months. eid: 2-s2.0-69949110943
47. **Relationships Among Depressive Symptoms, Benefit-Finding, Optimism, and Positive Affect in Multiple Sclerosis Patients After Psychotherapy for Depression**
Objective: While many patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) experience psychological problems, such as **depress**ion, benefit-finding is commonly reported. Using the Broaden-and-Build Model of positive emotions (Fredrickson, 2001) and the Expectancy-Value Model of optimism (Carver & Scheier, 1998) as two related, yet, distinct conceptual frameworks, this study examined positive affect and optimism as mediators of the relationship between impro**ved dep**ression and enhanced benefit-finding. Design: MS patients (N = 127), who participated in a larger, randomized clinical trial comparing two types of telephone psychother**apy for** depression, were assessed at baseline, midtherapy (8 weeks), end of therapy (16 weeks), and 6- and 12-month posttherapy. Main **Outcom****e Measu**res: Depression was measured with a telephone administered version of the Hamilton R**ating S**cale for Depression; Positive Affect was measured with the Positive Affect Subscale from the Positive and Negative Affect Scale; Optimism was measured with the Life Orientation Test-Revised; Benefit-Finding was measured with the revised version of the Stress-Related Growth Scale. Results: Data were analyzed with multilevel random-effects models, controlling for time since MS diagnosis and type of **treatme**nt. Improved depression was associated with increased benefit-finding over time. The relati**onship **between improved depression and benefit-finding was significantly mediated by both increased optimism and increased positive affect. Conclusion: Findings provide support to both theoretical models. Positivity appears to promote benefit-finding in MS.  2008 American Psychological Association. eid: 2-s2.0-43049091568

Background:**Depress**ion and anxiety are common, disabling and chronic. Self-guided internet-delivered treatments are popular, but few people complete them. New strategies are required to realise their potential.Aims:To evaluate the effect of automated emails on the effectiveness, safety, and acceptability of a new automated transdiagnostic self-guided internet-delivered treatment, the Wellbeing Course, for people w**ith dep**ression and anxiety.Method:A randomised controlled trial was conducted through the website: www.ecentreclinic.org. Two hundred and fifty seven people with elevated symptoms were randomly allocated to the 8 week course either with or without automated emails, or to a waitlist control group. Primary **outcom**e measures were the Patient Health Questionnaire 9-Item (PHQ-9) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item (GAD-7).Results:Participants in the treatment groups had lower PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores at post-treatment than controls. Automated emails increased rates of course completion (58% vs. 35%), and impro**ved ou**tcomes in a subsample with elevated symptoms.Conclusions:The new self-guided course was beneficial, and automated emails faci**litate**d outcomes.

49. **Patients' depression treatment preferences and initiation, adherence, and outcome: A randomized primary care study**
Objective: The authors examined the association of treatment preferences with treatment initiation, adherence, and clinical **outcom**e among nonsenior adult and senior primary care patients with **depress**ion. Methods: Sixty primary care participants meeting DSM-IV criteria for ma**jor dep**ression were randomly assigned to receive treatment congruent or incongruent with their primary stated preference. Participants received either 20 weeks of escitalopram, with monitoring by a care manager, or 12 weekly sessions of interpersonal psychotherapy followed by two monthly booster sessions. Adherence to treatm**ent and** depression severity were reassessed at weeks 4, 8, 12, and 24. Results: Participants expressed stronger preferences for psychotherapy t**han for** antidepressant medication. Preference strength was a more sensitive measure** of ou**tcome than was congruence versus incongruence of preference with the assigned treatment. Across age groups, preference strength was significantly associated with treatment initiation and 12-week adherence ra**te but **not with depression severity or remission. Conclusions: A continuous measure of preference strength may be a more useful measure in clinical practice than preferences per se. Future research should focus on whether and how greater facilitation of the treatment decision-making process between patient and clinician influences c**linica**l outcome. eid: 2-s2.0-61749099487
50. **A randomized trial of telemedicine-based collaborative care for depression**
BACKGROUND: Evidence-based practices designed for large urban clinics are not necessarily portable into smaller isolated clinics. Implementing practice-based collaborative care for **depress**ion in smaller primary care clinics presents unique challenges because it is often not feasible to employ on-site psychiatrists. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the Telemedicine Enhanced **Antidep**ressant Management (TEAM) study was to evaluate a telemedicine-based collaborative care model adapted for small clinics without on-site psychiatrists. DESIGN: Matched sites were randomized to the intervention or usual care. PARTICIPANTS: Small VA Community-based outpatient clinics with no on-site psychiatrists, but access to telepsychiatrists. In 2003-2004, 395 primary care patients wi**th PHQ9** depression severity scores 12 were enrolled, and followed for 12 months. Patients with serious mental illness and current substance dependence were excluded. MEASURES: Medication adherence, treatment response, remission, health status, health-related quality of life, and treatment satisfaction. RESULTS: The sample comprised mostly elderly, white, males with substantial physical and behavioral health comorbidity. At baseline, subjects h**ad mode**rate depression severity (Hopkins Symptom Checklist, SCL-20 = **1.8), 3**.7 prior depression episodes, and 67%** had re**ceived prior depression treatment. Multivariate analyses indicated that intervention patients were more likely to be adherent at both 6 (odds ratio [OR] = 2.1, p = .04) and 12 months (OR = 2.7, p = .01). Intervention patients were more likely to respond by 6 months (OR = 2.0, p = .02), and remit by 12 months (OR = 2.4, p = .02). Intervention patients reported larger gains in mental health status and health-related quality of life, and reported higher satisfaction.

51. **Treatment outcomes in depression: Comparison of remote treatment through telepsychiatry to in-person treatment**
Objective: Telepsychiatry is an increasingly common method of providing psychiatric care, but randomized trials of telepsychiatric treatment compared to in-person treatment have not been done. The primary objective of this study was to compare **treatment **outcom****es of patients with **depress**ive disorders treated remotely by means of telepsychiatry** to ou**tcomes** of dep**ressed patients treated in person. Secondary objectives were to determine if patients' rates of adherence to and satisfaction with treatment were as high with telepsychiatric as with in-person treatment and to compare costs of telepsychiatric treatment to costs of in-person treatment. Method: In this randomized, controlled tri**al, 119** depressed veterans referred for outpatient treatment were randomly assigned to either remote treatment by means of telepsychiatry or in-person treatment. Psychiatric treatment lasted 6 months and consisted of psychotropic medication, psychoeducation, and brief supportive counseling. Patien**ts' treatment ou**tcomes, satisfaction, and adherence and the costs of treatment were compared between the two conditions. Result**s: Hami**lton Depression Rating** Scale **and Beck Depression Inventory scores improved over the treatment period and did not differ between treatment groups. The two groups were equally adherent to appointments and medication treatment. No between-group differences in dropout rates or patients' ratings of satisfaction with treatment were found. Telepsychiatry was more expensive per treatment session, but this difference disappeared if the costs of psychiatrists' travel to remote clinics more than 22 miles away from the medical center were considered. Telepsychiatry did not increase the overall health care resource consumption of the patients during the study period. Conclusions: **Remote **treatment of depression by means of telepsychiatry and** in-per**son treatment of depression have com**parabl**e outcomes and equivalent levels of patient adherence, patient satisfaction, and health care cost. eid: 2-s2.0-3342991837
52. **Internet treatment for depression: A randomized controlled trial comparing clinician vs. technician assistance**
Background: Internet-based cognitive behavioural therapy (iCBT) for **depress**ion is effective when guided by a clinician, less so if unguided. Question: Would guidance from a technician be as effective as guidance from a clinician? Method: Randomized controlled non-inferiority trial comparing three groups: Clinician-assisted vs. technician-assisted vs. delayed treatment. Community-based volunteers applied to the VirtualClinic (www.virtualclinic.org.au) research program, and 141 participants with ma**jor dep**ressive disorder were randomized. Participants in the clinician- and technician-assisted groups received access to an iCBT prog**ram for** depression comprising 6 online lessons, weekly homework assignments, and weekly supportive contact over a treatment period of 8 weeks. Participants in the clinician-assisted group also received access to a moderated online discussion forum. The main **outcom**e measures we**re the **Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 Item (PHQ-9). Completion rates were high, and at post-treatment, both treatment groups reduced scores on the BDI-II (p<0.001) and PHQ-9 (p<0.001) compared to the delayed treatment group but did not differ from each other. Within group effect sizes on the BDI-II were 1.27 and 1.20 for the clinician- and technician-assisted groups respectively, and on the PHQ-9, were 1.54 and 1.60 respectively. At 4-month follow-up participants in the technician group had made further improvements and had significantly lower scores on the PHQ-9 than those in the clinician group. A total of approximately 60 minutes of clinician or technician time was required per participant during the 8-week treatment program. Conclusions: Both clinician- and technician-assisted treatment resulted in large effect sizes and clinically significant improvements comparable to those associated with face-to-face treatment, while a delayed treatment control group did not improve. These results provide support for large scale trials to determine the clinical effectiveness and acceptability of technician-assisted iC**BT prog**rams for depression. This form of treatment has potential to increase the capacity of existing mental health services.

53. **Stepping up: Predictors of stepping within an icbt stepped-care intervention for depression**
Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) may overcome barriers to mental health care and has proven **efficaci**ous. However, this approach currently exists outside the existing mental health care delivery system. Stepped care is a proposed framework for integrating digital mental health (DMH) into health systems by initiating iCBT and stepping up care to a more intensive intervention should iCBT prove ineffective. This study explores pre-treatment factors associated with reaching stepping criteria among patients receiving iCBT. This exploratory analysis of a stepped care arm of a larger randomized trial examined participants who were stepped to a more intensive intervention if they did not respond to iCBT. The association of pre-treatment factors on stepping were examined using KruskalWallis and Chi-square tests. One-fifth of the 151 participants met criteria for stepping within the 20-week treatment period. Only pre-treatment **depress**ion severity and treatment preference were associated with increased likelihood of stepping (p = 0.049 and 0.048, respectively). The low number of individuals who stepped provides support for iCBT as an effective, low intensity treatment **for dep**ression. The modest association of pre-tr**eatment** depression and preference to not receive iCBT may be useful in identifying patients who are less likely to respond.  2019 by the authors.

54. **Findings from a trial of the smartphone and online usage-based evaluation for depression (SOLVD) application: What do apps really tell us about patients with depression? concordance between app-generated data and standard psychiatric questionnaires for depression and anxiety**
Objective: **Depress**ion imposes a notable societal burden, with limited treatment success despite multiple available psychotherapy and medications choices. Potential reasons may include the heterogeneity** of dep**ression diagnoses and the presence of comorbid anxiety symptoms. Despite technological advances and the introduction of many mobile phone applications (apps) claiming to **relieve** depression,**major** gaps in knowledge still exist regarding what apps truly measure and how they correlate with psychometric questionnaires. The goal of this study was to evaluate whether mobile daily mood self-ratings may be useful in monitoring and **classif**ying depression symptoms **in a cl**inically depressed population compared with standard psychometric instruments including the Patient Health Questionaire-9 (PHQ-9), the Hamilt**on Rati**ng Scale for Depression (HAM-D), and the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A). Method: For this study,** 22 pat**ients wit**h **m**ajor depress**ive disorder with or without comorbid anxiety disorder were **recruit**ed. The diagnosis of depression was confirmed through the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). Over an 8-week period, daily moods were selfreported through the Smartphone and On**Line Us**age-based eValuation for Depression (SOLVD) application, a custom-designed application that was downlo**aded on**to patients' mobile devices. Depression and anxiety symptoms were also measured biweekly using the HAM-D, HAM-A, and PHQ-9. Results: Significant correlations were observed among self-evaluated mood, daily steps taken, SMS (text) frequency, average call duration, and biweekly psychometric scores (|r| > 0.5, P <0.05). The correlation coefficients were** higher** in individuals with more severe depressive symptoms. Conclusions: Although this study, given its limited sample size, was exploratory in nature, it helps fill a significant gap in our knowledge of the concordance between ratings obtained on the Ham-D, Ham-A, and the PHQ-9 psychometric instruments and data obtained via a smartphone app. These questionnaires represent goldstandard, commonly used psychiatric research/ clinical instruments, and, thus, this information can serve **as a fo**undation for digital phenotyping for depression and pave the way for interventional studies using smartphone applications.

55. **Evaluating the use of a computerized CBT program for outpatients on a waitlist in a university CBT unit**
Objectives and Design: The goal of this pilot randomized controlled trial was to determine whether a computerized cognitive-behavioral therapy (cCBT) program for **depress**ion and anxiety could reduce symptoms in outpatients on a waitlist for face-to-face CBT for a variety of mental health complaints. Methods: Sixty-seven outpatients referred for CBT for disparate problems (eg, anxie**ty, dep**ression, obsessions or compulsions) were randomized to 1 of 2 conditions: (1) the cCBT program "Good Days Ahead," which included weekly guidance and support, or (2) a control condition where patients were referred to a freely available online CBT workbook. Measures of psychological distress were administered at the start of study and at the end of the waiting period, when participants were formally diagnosed and assessed for face-to-face therapy. Results: For the most part, mixed-design analyses of variances revealed no statistically significant changes in symptom measures over time. Nonsignificant interactions and modest effect sizes between groups across time suggest that the cCBT group did not do better than the control group. The **major**ity of cCBT participants reported that the program was "very" or "extremely useful," while only a portion of the control group felt the same about the workbook. There were notable differences in the completion rates of the 2 groups in favor of the cCBT program. Conclusions: Offering a general cCBT program to waiting list patients may not confer an advantage over referring them to an online workbook, at least in terms of symptom reduction. Results could be partly explained by difficulties translating knowledge into practice, especially if participants' main problem was not directly addressed by the intervention.

56. **Examining the effectiveness of a web-based intervention for symptoms of depression and anxiety in college students: Study protocol of a randomised controlled trial**
Introduction The college years are a peak period for the onset of common mental disorders. Poor mental health is associated with low academic attainment, physical, interpersonal and cognitive impairments. Universities can use online approaches to screen students for mental disorders and treat those in need. The present study aims to assess the effectiveness of a guided web-based transdiagnostic individually tailored intervention to treat students with symptoms of **depress**ion and/or anxiety. Methods and analysis The present study is a randomised controlled trial. Participants are Dutch college students (18 years) with mild to moder**ate dep**ression and/or anxiety symptoms. The intervention is a guided web-based transdiagnostic individually tailored intervention that targets symp**toms of** depression and/or anxiety. The intervention consists of seven online sessions with a duration ranging from 4 to 7 weeks depending on individual progress. A booster session is administered 4 weeks after the completion of the seventh session. Primary **outcom**e measures are the Patient Health Questi**onnaire** for depression and the Generalised Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale for anxiety. These scales are administered at screening, post-treatment and follow-up assessments (6 and 12 months post-randomisation). Ethics and dissemination The Medical Ethics Committee of the Vrije Universiteit Medical Centre has approved the protocol (registration number 2016.583, A2017.362andA2018.421).

The COVID-19 pandemic is a major health crisis affecting several nations, with over 720,000 cases and 33,000 confirmed deaths reported to date. Such widespread outbreaks are associated with adverse mental health consequences. Keeping this in mind, existing **literatur**e on the COVID-19 outbreak pertinent to mental health was retrieved vi**a a liter**ature search of the PubMed database. Published articles were classified according to their **overal**l themes and summarized. Preliminary evidence suggests that symptoms of anxiety and **depress**ion (1628%) and self-reported stress (8%) are common psychological reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic, and may be associated with disturbed **sleep**. A number of individual and structural variables moderate this risk. In planning services for such populations, both the needs of the concerned people and the necessary **prevent**ive guidelines must be taken into account. The av**ailable l**iterature has emerged from only a few of the affected countries, and may not reflect the **experi**ence of persons living in other parts of the world. In conclusion, subsyndromal mental health problems are a common **respons**e to the COVID-19 pandemic. There is a need for more representative research from other affected countries, particularly in vulnerable populations.  2020 Elsevier B.V. eid: 2-s2.0-85083048100
1. **An internet-based cognitive-behavioral preventive intervention for complicated grief: A pilot study**
Bereaved parents and individuals bereaved by the sudden, unexpected, or violent death of a loved one are at high risk for developing complicated grief. However, **prevent**ive interventions for this at-risk population remain scarce. In the present pilot study, an Internet-based intervention for individuals bereaved in the previous 14 months was tested using a pretest/posttest design. A total of 35 bereaved individuals participated in a 3-week manuali**zed pre**vention program. Counselor and participants communicated exclusively via email. The intervention consisted of the following modules: (1) describing the circumstances of the death, (2) using the life-imprint method to explore the biography and life imprint of the deceased, (3) keeping a daily diary of social activities and **sleep** hygiene, (4) cognitive restructuring of dysfunctional thoughts, such as **respons**ibility for the death and feelings of guilt, (5) communication within the family, (6) gender-specific coping with bereavement, and (7) bond with the deceased. Completer and intent-to-treat analyses suggest that the intervention led to a significant reduction in symptoms of complicated grief and **depress**ion at posttreatment.

This article describes a mixed-methods approach to understand the **experi**ence of adolescents involved in the Internet-based intervention for **depress**ion, Competent Adulthood Transition with Cognitive Behavioral Humanistic and Interpersonal Training (CATCH-IT), as well as **the ex**periences of their parents while they were involved. Qualitative analysis was done with grounded theory-based categorization of interview comments and typed program **respons**es (adolescents only) into themes. Quantitative analysis was done with self-report surveys. The article describes the nine themes reflecting the ado**lescen**t experience and the three themes reflecting** the p**arent experience. The article also describes the results of the quantitative surveys of helpfulness and attitudes change, which were favorable of the Internet-based intervention. Separate models explaining the psychological transformation of the adol**escent**s and the experience of the parents are pro**posed.** The positive experience of the adolescents and parents involved in CATCH-IT is discussed in the context of growing interest in how best to utilize Internet-based interventions for mental illness, and suggestions are made for future investigation.  2011 Elsevier Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-82855175151
3. **Internet-Based Interventions for the Prevention and Treatment of Mental Disorders in Latin America: A Scoping Review**
Background: There is a huge gap in the treatment of mental disorders in Latin America, especially among socioeconomically disadvantaged groups. Given the sharp increase in Internet access and the rapid penetration of smartphones in the region, the use of Internet-based technologies might potentially contribute to overcoming this gap and to provide more widely distributed and low-cost mental health care in a variety of contexts. Methods: We conducted a scoping review of the **literatur**e in order to systematically map the existing evidence on use of Internet-based interventions for **prevent**ion, treatment, and management of mental disorders across Latin American countries, as well as to identify existing gaps in knowledge. Six electronic databases were searched for published papers (PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, SciELO, and CENTRAL). Results: After the eligibility assessment, we identified 22 Internet-based studies carried out in Latin America **for pre**vention, treatment, education, or facilitating self-management of mental disorders. Included studies mainly targeted **depress**ion (n = 11), substance misuse (n = 6), anxiety (n = 3), and mental health literacy for education and health professionals (n = 2). Most studies were undertaken in Brazil (n = 6), Mexico (n = 5), and Chile (n = 4). Only 3 studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs), 4 were pilot RCTs, and 15 were naturalistic, acceptability, or feasibility studies. The three RCTs identified showed disparate results, but **overal**l, there are challenges to face. Better results are seen in the short-term (postintervention or after 3 months), but most studies do not explore outcomes for long enough (follow-up after 6 or 12 months). Most of the feasibility and pilot studies showed reasonably good acceptability for a wide range of strategies but difficulties to engage and retain participants for long enough or adhering to established protocols. Conclusion: This study shows that Internet-based interventions **for the** prevention and treatment of mental disorders are growing rapidly in Latin America, but there are few studies on effectiveness and cost effectiveness, making it difficult to provide the evidence needed to justify scaling up these interventions.

0. **Informed collaboration in health care: An embedded-cases study in geriatric telepsychiatry**
Telemedicine, the delivery of medical consultation and services, is enabled by information and communications technologies. Participants in telemedicine consultation services (ie, clinicians, patients, and other parties) use **video** conferencing, special-purpose software and/or hardware, and data and notes from electronic medical records and other systems to formulate effective treatment plans. Telemedicine is a particular mode of informed **collabor**ationinformation and communications technologysuppor**ted coll**aborative activity i**n which **collaborators rely (wholly or in part) on digitally stored information retrieved from various sources to pursue their collective objectives. We report on an embedded-**case**s study of a long-running geriatric telepsychiatry clinic in the north-eastern United States. Our analysis draws on the theory of distributed cognition (DCog) to explicate the ways in which information and cognitive effort are distributed across individuals and artefacts to support psychiatric consultation from a distance and how these processes play out over time in routines. On the basis of t**his **case study, we offer a refinement of DCog theory, focusing on four interrelated dynamic processes that, we propose, act as critical enablers **of infor**med collaboration: cognitive offloading, visibility of action, intersubjective understanding, and knowledge redundancy. We discuss practical implications for designing telemedicine services and tools, and we offer suggestions for further resea**rch on i**nformed collaboration.  2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd eid: 2-s2.0-85052650861
1. **A study on collaborative telepsychiatric consultations to outpatients of district hospitals of Karnataka, India**
Introduction: The Indian National Mental Health Survey (NMHS) of 20152016 has estimated 13.7% lifetime and 10.6% point prevalence for mental illnesses. It has identified that the treatment gap for mental illnesses ranges between 70% and 92%. Tele-Psychiatric consultations could be an alternative and innovative approach to bridge this gap in low resource settings. Aims: To study the sociodemographic and clinical profiles of patients who have received **collabor**ative Tele-Psychiatric consultations across district hospitals in Karnataka, India. Methodology: We performed a retrospective review of **case** files of patients who have recei**ved coll**aborative Tele-Psychiatric consultations from January 2013 to June 2017 through **video**-conferencing. A total of 139 consultations were provided to patients in the state of Karnataka. Results: The mean age of the sample is 31 (15.5) years. 61.8% were male and 79.8% were aged more than 18 years. In total, 25.9% of them had schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, 14.4% had mental retardation, 13.7% had a mood disorder and 14.4% had a substance use disorder. 67.6% of patients had been advised pharmacotherapy, 7.9% had been advised rehabilitation along with pharmacotherapy and 24.4% were advised further evaluation of illness and inpatient care at a higher centre. Conc**lusion: **Collaborative tele-psychiatric consultations to district hospitals from an academic tertiary care hospital can be feasible and are likely to benefit patients from rural areas. There is a need for more studies to elucidate their acceptability by patients, caregivers and professionals.  2018 Elsevier B.V. eid: 2-s2.0-85054061928
2. **Collaborative academic training of psychiatrists and psychologists in va and medical school settings**
Objective: The authors review the background and contemporary strengths of Dean's Committee Veterans Affairs Medical Centers in the **collabor**ative academic training of psychiatrists and psychologists. Methods: The authors discuss the problems and prospects of the current health care environment as it impacts the behavioral health treatment of returning veterans from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the educational agenda for psychiatry and psychology. The medical education program in psychiatry and the internship program in psychology at the Syracuse Veterans Affairs Medical Center and the SUNY Upstate Medical University provide an exemplar of acade**mic coll**aboration in clinical training. Results: Within this combined educational environment, opportunities and challenges abound for interns and residents to receive advanced training in the state-of-the-art assessment and treatment of disorders related to psychological trauma, posttraumatic stress disorder, sexual trauma, traumatic brain injury, polytrauma, behavioral health in primary care, and telepsychiatry.

3. **Asynchronous Telepsychiatry: A Component of Stepped Integrated Care**
Objective: Integrated behavioral healthcare models typically involve a range of consultation options for mental healthcare. **Asynchron**ous telepsychiatry (ATP) consults may be an additional potential choice, so we are conducting a 5-year clinical trial comparing ATP with synchronous telepsychiatry (STP) consultations. Methods: Patients referred by primary care providers are randomly assigned to one of the two treatment groups, ATP or STP. Clinical outcome, satisfaction, and economic data are being collected from patients for 2 years at 6-month intervals. Results: Baseline characteristics for the **first** 158 patients and **case** examples of ATP are presented. Conclusion: Implementing ATP in existing integrated behavioral healthcare models could make mental healthcare more **effici**ent.  Copyright 2018, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-85046971165
4. **Asynchronous telepsychiatry in Maharashtra, India: Study of feasibility and referral pattern**
Context: There is a paucity of published telepsychiatry results in India. Aims: This study was conducted to assess the feasibility of **asynchron**ous telepsychiatry and to study the referral patterns. Settings and Design: This study was conducted in the telemedicine unit of a tertiary care center and design was retrospective analysis of 94 **case**s, which were diagnosed and treated by telepsychiatry. Materials and Methods: All 94 patients who were referred between January 2007 and August 2013 for telepsychiatry consultations were retrospectively analyzed to assess the referral pattern and feasibility. Statistical Analysis Used: Comparisons between demographic parameters and psychiatric diagnosis was done using Chi-square test. Results: In 89 out of 94 (95%) patients it was possible to make a definitive diagnosis and recommend appropriate treatment only on the basis of data received from the primary care physician by telepsychiatry. This indicates the feasibility of telepsychiatry. The most common problems for which referrals were made included schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, mood disorders and substance related disorders. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the feasibility** of Async**hronous telepsychiatry. Additional Indian studies should be conducted to build the evidence base for the best** use of a**synchronous telepsychiatry. eid: 2-s2.0-84903980960
5. **Telemental health: Responding to mandates for reform in primary healthcare**
Telemental health (TMH) has established a niche as a feasible, acceptable, and effective service model to improve the mental healthcare and outcomes for individuals who cannot access traditional **mental health servic**es. The Accountability Care Act has mandated reforms in the structure, functioning, and financing of primary care that provide an opportunity for TMH to move into the mainstream healthcare system. By partnering with the Integrated Behavioral Healthcare Model, TMH offers a spectrum of tools to unite primary care physicians and mental health specialist in a mind-body view of patients' healthcare needs and to activate patients in their own care. TMH tools include **video**-teleconferencing to telecommute mental health specialists to the primary care setting to **collabor**ate with a team in caring for patients' mental healthcare needs and to provide direct services to patients who are not progressing optimally with t**his coll**aborative model. **Asynchron**ous tools include online therapies that offer an **effici**ent **first** step to treatment for selected disorders such as depression and anxiety. Patients activate themselves in their care through portals that provide access to their healthcare information and Web sites that offer on-demand information and communication with a healthcare team. These synchronous **and async**hronous TMH tools may move the site of mental healthcare from the clinic to the home. The evolving role of social media in facilitating communication among patients or with their healthcare team deserves further consideration as a tool to activate patients and provide more personalized care.  2013, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-84896550617
6. **An Update on Telepsychiatry and How It Can Leverage Collaborative, Stepped, and Integrated Services to Primary Care**
Introduction: In this era of patient-centered care, telepsychiatry (TP; **video** or synchronous) provides quality care with outcomes as good as in-person care, facilitates access to care, and leverages a wide range of treatments at a distance. Method: This conceptual review article explores TP as applied to newer models of care (e.g., **collabor**ative, stepped, and integrated care). Results: The field of psychosomatic medicine (PSM) has developed clinical care models, educates interdisciplinary team members, and provides leadership to clinical teams. PSM is uniquely positioned to steer TP and implement other telebehavioral health care options (e.g., e-mail/telephone, psych/mental health apps) in the future in primary care. Together, PSM and TP provide versatility to health systems by enabling more patient points-of-entry, matching patient needs with provider skills, and helping providers work at the top of their licenses. TP and other technologies m**ake coll**aborative, stepped, and integrated care less costly and more accessible. Conclusion: Effective health care delivery matches the intensity of the services to the needs of a patient population or clinic, standardizes interventions, and evaluates both process and clinical outcomes. More research is indicated on the application of TP and other technologies to these service delivery models.  2018 Academy of Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry. eid: 2-s2.0-85043382170

Objective: To describe the technical development of an **asynchron**ous telepsychiatry application, the Psychiatric **Video** Archiving and Communication System. Methods: A client-server application was developed in Visual Basic.Net with Microsoft SQL database as the backend. It includes the capability of stor**ing v**ideo-recorded psychiatric interviews and manages the workflow of the system with automated messaging. Results: Psyc**hiatr**ic Video Archiving and Communication System has been used to conduct the **first** ever series** of async**hronous telepsychiatry consultations worldwide. A review of the software application and the process as part of this project has led to a number of improvements that are being implemented in the next version, which is being written in Java. Conclusions: This is **the f**irst description of** the **use of video recorded dat**a in an a**synchronous telemedicine application. Primary care providers and consulting psychiatrists have found it easy to work with and a valuable resource to increase the availability of psychiatric consultation in remote rural locations.  2011, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-79957603064
8. **Disruptive innovation: The future of healthcare?**
The traditional face-to-face doctor-patient relationship is the core of conventional medical practice. One key aspect of this changing relationship is the increasing dependency on **asynchron**ous data collection in clinical consultations. Such electronic communications and data streams may be numeric, text-based, audio, digitized still pictures, **video** and radiologic, as well as emanating from multiple medical devices. Wh**ile async**hronous medicine may be established in specialties like radiology and dermatology, there is little research regarding the** use of a**synchronous medicine in areas of medicine that traditionally rely on the physical doctor-patient interaction such as primary care, internal medicine, geriatrics, and psychiatry. The practice of psychiatry stands out as a discipline that is highly dependent on the quality of the physical meeting between the doctor and the patient, yet even in this specialty it is possible** to utili**ze asynchronous medicine for some types of psychiatric** consulta**tions. Asynchronous medicine has the potential to be significantly disruptive to our current healthcare processes, as well as more clinically and economically **effici**ent.

9. **Telepsychiatry in Chennai, India: The SCARF experience**
India, with its huge population and limited mental health resources, must find alternative ways of delivering its mental healthcare services. Telepsychiatry seems to be a promising option even with no regulatory authority in place or specific laws in India that deal with telemedicine practice, there has been a mushrooming of telemedicine services in India. Healthy cooperation between government organizations such as the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) and institutions in the non-government and private sectors is another key feature in India. The experience of the Schizophrenia Research Foundation (SCARF), at Chennai, in South India, in running and establishing a telepsychiatry network is presented in this article. We identified the following tasks as essential to ensure an **effici**ent intervention using telemedicine: identifying a suitable technology, a suitable location, and a local **collabor**ator; providing training and creating awareness; establishing peripheral telepsychiatry centers and ensuring **case** documentation; and accountability.

10. **Cost analysis of store-and-forward telepsychiatry as a consultation model for primary care**
Store-and-forward telepsychiatry, or **asynchron**ous telepsychiatry (ATP), which allows clinical data, including **video** to be collected to be reviewed at a later time by a specialist, has been described as a feasible alternative to real-time telepsychiatry, or synchronous telepsychiatry (STP), as a consultation model for primary care. In theory, ATP should be economically more cost-effective than STP due to the increased flexibility of patient data collection and the substitution of the time of specialists with that of lower-cost providers. The aim of this study was to conduct a retrospective cost-analysis comparing ATP with STP and traditional in-person psychiatric consultations in the primary care setting. One hundred and twenty five ATP consultations were performed and fixed and marginal costs were calculated for each model using inputs such as equipment costs, time spent by providers and support staff, and hourly salaries. The fixed costs were $7,000 and $20,000 for ATP and STP and marginal costs were $68.18, $107.50, and $96.36, respectively, for the three groups. STP was the most expensive of the three types of consultations. ATP became the most cost-effective of the three models beyond 249 consultations. The marginal cost savings of ATP were due to substitution of low-cost providers for specialists. ATP represents a potential disruptive healthcare process that could allow more affordable care to be delivered to a larger population of patients. A full accounting of ATP's **effici**ency will require further studies, including prospective cost-benefit analyses from the perspectives of the patient, provider, and society.  2012 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-84856731575
11. **A feasibility study of the use of asynchronous telepsychiatry for psychiatric consultations**
Objective: This study examined the feasibility of conducting psychiatric consultations using **asynchron**ous, or store-and-forward, **video**based telepsychiatry. Metho**ds: V**ideo-recorded 20- to 30-minute assessments of 60 nonemergency, English-speaking adult patients in a medically underserved county in California were uploaded along with other patient data to a Webbased record. Two psychiatrists then used the record to provide psychiatric consultations to the referring primary care providers. Results: Eighty-five percent of patients received diagnoses of mood disorders, 32% diagnoses of substance use disorders, 53% diagnoses of anxiety disorders, and 5% other axis I diagnoses. Psychiatrists recommended short-term medication changes for 95% of the patients and provided guidelines for possible future changes. Conclusions: This study - the **first** study** of async**hronous telepsychiatry to be published - demonstrated the feasibility of this approach. This type of assessment should not replace the face-to-face psychiatric interview, but it may be a very helpful additional process that improves access to care and expertise. eid: 2-s2.0-77955366460

With increased negative impacts from opioid and other substance use disorders in the US, it is important for treatments to not only be effective, but also accessible to patients. Treatment delivery via telemedicine, specifically, the use of videoconferencing, which allows real time communication between a patient and a clinician at a distant site, has been shown to be an effective approach for increasing reach and access to treatments for mental health disorders and other chronic illnesses. This **systemat**ic review identified and summarized studies examining the effectiveness of telemedicine interventions to deliver treatment for patients with substance use disorders. Out of 841 manuscripts that met our **search** criteria, 13 studies met the **inclus**ion criteria. Studies covered interventions for nicotine, alcohol and opioid use disorders. They varied widely in size, quality, and in the comparison groups examined. Studies examined both delivery of psychotherapy and medication treatments. Most studies suggested telemedicine interventions were associated with high **patient **satisfact****ion and are an effective alternative, especially when access to treatment is otherwise limited. However, there were substantial methodological limitations to th**e rese**arch conducted to date. Further studies are needed, including larger scale randomized studies that examine different models of telemedicine that can be integrated into existing healthcare delivery settings, to increase the use of effective treatments for patients with substance use disorders.  2019 eid: 2-s2.0-85063614225
1. **Telepsychological services with criminal justice and substance abuse clients: A systematic review and meta-analysis**
Recent years have seen the incorporation of telepsychology into poorly accessed, rural, and underserved settings, including criminal justice and substance abuse treatment. A **systemat**ic **search** of the **literatur**e on telepsychological and related services with justice-involved and substance abuse clients revealed numerous descriptive reports, but few empirical studies. The results of 3 studies of criminal justice participants and 2 studies of substance-abuse participants were subjected to a series of 5 outcome-specific meta-analyses (mental health symptoms, therapeutic processes, program engagement, program performance, and service **satisfact**ion). These 5 studies, all of which utilized a comparison group, contributed a total of 342 participants and 14 total effect sizes. Summary data on 3 additional uncontrolled studies are also presented. Results indicated that telepsychological outcomes were at least comparable with in-person outcomes. This review serves as an initial reference for clinicians and policymakers working with criminal justice and substance abuse clients, but also highlights the need for more rigorous scientific investigation into the nuances of telepsychological practice. eid: 2-s2.0-84957955680
2. **Interventions designed to improve therapeutic communications between black and minority ethnic people and professionals working in psychiatric services: A systematic review of the evidence for their effectiveness**
Background: Black and minority ethnic (BME) people using psychiatric services are at greater risk of non-engagement, dropout from care and not receiving evidence-based interventions than white British people. Objectives: To identify effective interventions designed to improve therapeutic communications (TCs) for BME patients using psychiatric services in the UK, to identify gaps in the re**search** **literatur**e and to recommend futur**e rese**arch. Participants: Black African, black Caribbean, black British, white British, Pakistani and Bangladeshi patients in psychiatric services in the UK, or recruited from the community to enter psychiatric care. Some studies from the USA included Hispanic, Latino, Chinese, Vietnamese, Cambodian and African American people. Interventions: Any that improve TCs between BME patients and staff in psychiatric services. Data sources: The publis**hed liter**atur**e, grey l**iterature, an expert survey, and patients' and carers perspectives on the evidence base. **Databas****es wer**e searched from their inception to 4 February 20**13. Dat**abases included **MEDLIN**E, Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts, The **Cochran**e Library, Social Science Citation Index, Allied and Complementary M**edicine** Database, PsycINFO, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Al**lied Heal**th Literature, EMBASE, The Campbell Collaboration and ProQuest for dissertations. Review methods: Studies were included if they reported **evalu**ation data about interventions designed to improve therapeutic outcomes by improving communication between BME patients and psychiatric professionals. Qualitative studies and repo**rts in th**e grey literature were included only if they gave a criti**cal e**valuative statement. Two members of the team selected studies against pre-established criteria and any differences were resolved by consensus or by a third reviewer, if necessary. Data were extracted independently by two people and summarised in tables by specific study designs. Studies were subjected to a narrative synthesis that included a thematic analysis contrasting populations, countries and the strength of evidence for any intervention. The components of the interventions were compared. Patient perspectives on acceptability were considered alongside quality scores and methodological strengths and weaknesses. Results: Twenty-one studies (19** from the** published literatur**e and two** from the grey literature) met the **inclus**ion criteria. There were 12 trials, two observational quantitative studies, three case series, a qualitative study and three descriptive case studies. Only two studies, one a pilot trial and one a case series, included economic data; in both, a favourable but weak economic case could be made for the intervention. The trials tested interventions to prepare patients for therapeutic interventions, variable levels of ethnic matching (of professional to patient), cultural adaptation of therapies, and interventions that included social community systems in order to facilitate access to services. Empowering interventions favoured by patients and carers included adapted cognitivebehavioural therapy, assessments of explanatory models, cultural consultation, ethnographic and motivational interviews, and a telepsychiatry intervention. Limitations: Studies tended to have small sample sizes or to be pilot studies, and to use proxy rather than direct measures for TCs. Conclusions: Empowering interventions should b**e furt**her researched and brought to the attention of commissioners. Several promising interventions need furth**er eva**luative research and e**conom**ic evaluations are needed.  Queens Printer and Controller of HMSO 2015. eid: 2-s2.0-84929150906
3. **Effectiveness and feasibility of telepsychiatry in resource constrained environments? A systematic review of the evidence**
Objective: A review of **systemat**ic reviews of the effectiveness and feasibility of videoconference-based telepsychiatry services for resource constrained environments was conducted. Specifically with the aim of producing an evidence-based review of the effectiveness and feasibility of videoconference-based telepsychiatry services in resource constrained countries like South Africa. Methods: Eight key questions on telepsychiatry effectiveness and feasibility were identified and **inclus**ion and exclusion criteria were developed. Review of citations from 2000-2011 from CINAHL, **Medlin**e, Pubmed, PsycInfo, EBSCOhost, SABINET, **Cochran**e **Databas**e** of Syst**ematic Reviews (CCT**R), Coc**hrane Controlled Trial Registry (CCT**R), Dat**abase of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE), unpublished abstracts through NEXUS and internet **search** engines (Google/Google scholar) was conducted. Resul**ts: Ten **systematic reviews were included for review. Despite the methodological limitations and heterogen**eity of **the systematic reviews, there appears to be good evidence of effectiveness (reliability and improved outcomes) and feasibility (use, **satisfact**ion, acceptability and cost) for videoconference-based telepsychiatry internationally. The application of this evidence in lower middle income countries is dependent on the integration of telepsychiatry into local health system contexts. Conclusion: Based on the evidence, resource constrained countries such as South Africa should be encouraged to develop telepsychiatry programs along with rigorous **evalu**ation methods. eid: 2-s2.0-84871017282
4. **What about telepsychiatry? A systematic review**
Background: Mental illness has become a significant worldwide health issue in recent years. There is presently insufficient evidence to definitively determine the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of different health care models. The objective of this study was to **evalu**ate the effectiveness of videoconferencing in mental illness. Data Sources: **Literatur**e **search**es were performed in **Medlin**e, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, and The **Cochran**e Library Controlled Trial Registry **databas**es (1997-May 2008)**. A se**arch of the following terms was used: e-health, mental disorders (MeSH term), mental health (MeSH term), mental health services (MeSH term), telecare, teleconsultation, telehome, telemedical, telemedicine, telemental, telepsychiatric, telepsychiatry, televideo, videoconference, and videophone. Study Selection: Type of disease, interventions, and clinical outcomes or **patient **satisfact****ion were identified. Exclusion criteria included studies that did not analyze intervention outcomes and studies with a sample size of fewer than 10 cases. Peer review and quality assessment according** to Coc**hrane recommendations were required for **inclus**ion. Data Extraction/Synthesis: Of 620 identified articles, 10 randomized controlled trials are included (1,054 patients with various mental disorders). There were no statistically significant differences between study groups for symptoms, quality of life, **and patient satis**faction. Conclusions: There is insufficient scientific evidence regarding the effectiveness of telepsychiatry in the management of mental illness, and** more **research is needed to furt**her e**valuate its efficiency. However, there is a strong hypothesis that videoconference-based treatment obtains the same results as face-to-face therapy and that telepsychiatry is a useful alternative when face-to-face therapy is not possible.  2010 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-78650541332
5. **The use of telemedicine in psychiatry**
This paper examines the potential effects of using video-conferencing within the field of mental health in the UK. In order to assess the usefulness of telepsychiatric services, an electronic **search** was conducted for articles published between August 1998 and July 2006 using the **MEDLIN**E, EMBASE, PsychINFO and Telemedicine and Information Exchange (TIE) **databas**es. **The se**arch was carried out using the following terms: telepsychiatry, videoconferencing and telepsychology. A total of 178 articles were identified and based on review of the abstracts 72 were identified as being specific to efficacy, cost-effectiveness and **satisfact**ion with psychiatric services delivered via videoconferencing. This paper concludes that the use of video conferencing can enhance psychiatric services within the UK especially for those patients who live in rural areas. Current advances in technology make this an increasingly more reliable and cost-effective method for assessing patients. The limitations of telemedicine are discussed and it is clear that this type of care is not suitable for all patients. Fu**rther **research is required to assess the types of patients that telepsychiatry is most suitable for.  2006 The Author. eid: 2-s2.0-33750682657
6. **Procedural and methodological issues in telepsychiatry research and program development**
Objective: The authors reviewed the **literatur**e related to telepsychiatry - applications of videoconferencing technology for mental health care - which offers hope for an affordable means of solving long-standing workforce problems, particularly in geographical areas where specialist providers are not readily available. Methods: To conduct a comprehensive review of the telepsychia**try liter**ature, the authors **search**ed the **MEDLIN**E **databas**e (1970 to February 2000), using the keywords telepsychiatry, telemedicine, and videoconferencing. Studies were selected that included the use of videoconferencing technology for the provision of any form of mental health care services. Results and conclusions: Psychiatric interviews conducted by telepsychiatry appear to be generally reliable, and patients and clinicians generally report high levels of **satisfact**ion with telepsychiatry. A significant limitation** of the l**iterature is the lack of empirica**l rese**arch on telepsychiatry, especially cost analyses and clinical outcome studies. The authors outl**ine a **research agenda addressing the procedural and methodological issues that should sha**pe fut**ure research: study design, outcome measurement, consideration of patient characteristics, and program design. eid: 2-s2.0-0033667568
7. **Assessing telemedicine: A systematic review of the literature**
Background: To clarify the current status of telemedicine, we carried out a **systemat**ic review of the **literatur**e. We identified controlled assessment studies of telemedicine that reported patient outcomes, administrative changes or economic assessments and assessed the quality of t**hat liter**ature. Methods: We carried ou**t a syst**ematic electronic **search** for articles published from 1966 to early 2000 using the **MEDLIN**E (1966-April 2000), HEALTHSTAR (1975-January 2000), EMBASE (1988-February 2000) and CINALH (1982-January 2000) **databas**es. In addition, the HS**TAT dat**abase (Health Services/Technology Assessment Text, US National Library of Medicin**e), the** Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE, NHS Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, United Kingdom), the NHS Economic **E**valu**a**tion Database and the **Cochran**e Controlled Trials Register w**ere se**arched. We consulted experts in the field and did a** manua**l search of the reference lists of review articles. Results: A total of 1124 studies were identified. Based on a review of the abstracts, 133 full-text articles were obtained for closer inspection. Of these, 50 were deemed to represent assessment studies fulfilling the **inclus**ion criteria of the review. Thirty-four of the articles assessed at least some clinical outcomes; the remaining 16 were mainly economic analyses. Most of the av**ailable l**iterature referred only to pilot projects and short-term outcomes, and most of the studies were of low quality. Relatively convincing evidence of effectiveness was found only for teleradiology, teleneurosurgery, telepsychiatry, transmission of echocardiographic images, and the use of electronic referrals enabling email consultations and video conferencing between primary and secondary health care providers. Economic analyses suggested that teleradiology, especially transmission of CT images, can be cost-saving. Interpretation: Evidence regarding the effectiveness or cost-effectiveness of telemedicine is still limited. Based on current scientific evidence, only a few telemedicine applications can be recommended for broader use. eid: 2-s2.0-0034808894

0. **Telepsychology in a University Psychology Clinic Setting: A Pilot Project**
Objective: The focus of the present study was to investigate levels of psychological distress and **therapeut**ic **allianc**e rated by **client**s attending psychological therapy sessions via video therapy or **in person** at a university psychology-training clinic. Method: Participants were** 23 cl**ients who had completed at least five therapy sessions with a provisional psychologist on placement in a university psychology clinic. Six of these attended sessions via **videoconfer**encing in Port Augusta and 17 wer**e loca**l clients who attended traditional in-person sessions. Both qualitative and quantitative methods were utilised in order to identify perceptions of and reactions to video therapy as described by participants. Results: Reported levels of psychological distress across sessions were within the clinical range and similar across both video therapy and in-person settings, with no statistical differences between the groups. Equally **high** levels** of thera**peu**tic all**iance were established across both settings. Participants' experiences of video therapy were further explored under five main themes identified through content analysis: Initial Reactions and Adjustments, Factors Affecting Communication, Perceived Effecti**veness, T**her**apeutic** Alliance, and Practical Factors. Conclusions: Findings suggest video therapy provided by provisional psychologists represents a feasible and acceptable means by which **rural** residents can access psychological treatments in the Australian context.  2015 The Australian Psychological Society. eid: 2-s2.0-84937563033
1. **The effects of telepsychology format on empathic accuracy and the therapeutic alliance: An analogue counselling session**
Objective: The primary purpose of this study was to evaluate whether psychotherapy format (**videoconfer**encing, telephone or in-person) influenced **therapist** empathic accuracy and **client**s perceptions of the **therapeut**ic **allianc**e. We also evaluated whet**her cl**ient attitudes towards using telepsychology influenced **the thera**peu**tic all**iance in the telepsychology formats. A secondary purpose was to determine whether empathic accuracy predic**ted the t**her**apeutic** alliance differently across service delivery formats. Method: A randomised block design was used to assign vo**luntee**r clients (N=58) to receive one session of psychotherapy i**n a videoco**nferencing, telephonic or in-per**son fo**rmat. Clients co**mpleted t**wo **therape**utic alliance measures and a telepsychology attitudes measure, and b**oth t**hera****pists and clients completed an empathic accuracy measure. Results: There were no statistically significant differences between the condit**ions on t**herapist empat**hic accur**acy** or the**rapeutic alliance. Attitudes towards telepsychology and empathic accuracy were both signif**icant p**redictors of alliance in the telepsychology delivery formats. Interestingly, empathic accuracy **did not p****redict** the thera**peutic** alliance for clients in the in-person condition. Conclusions: Although preliminary, the results suggest that the technology-mediated psychotherapy processes o**f empathi****c accu**racy and therapeutic alliance seem to be similar to in-person psychotherapy. Empathic accuracy, however, may be a m**ore sa**lient process for clients who receive services in a telepsychology format.

2. **Use of information and communication technologies by Spanish psychologists, and their needs [Uso de las nuevas tecnologas por parte de los psiclogos espaoles y sus necesidades]**
The aim of this paper is to know the real situation in the use of information and communication technologies alongside the attitude of psychologists in Madrid Region. We conducted a quantitative research by means of a questionnaire based on previous literature reviews regarding the same topic in other countries. The sample consisted of all psychologists registered in the Spanish Psychology Association (COP), Madrid branch, with a total 486 responses. Only 26% use teletherapy along with other combined therapy modality involving face to face communication. Drawbacks in the study include primarily limitations of non-verbal communication and the **therapeut**ic **allianc**e, followed by confidentiality of data and technical problems with handling data.  2017 Colegio Oficial de Psiclogos de Madrid eid: 2-s2.0-85019267843
3. **"Going the Extra Mile": Satisfaction and Alliance Findings from an Evaluation of Videoconferencing Telepsychology in Rural Western Australia**
Objective: Technology is changing how we behave, communicate, and process information, and this has significant implications for mental health care. Telepsychology has appeal as a solution to obstacles of distance and access in **rural** and regional areas; however, few services appear to provide telepsychology as a routine service component for psycho**therapeut**ic exchanges. The primary research goal of a multi-year PhD project was to explore and explain the disconnect between research and practice in telepsychology, and to investigate, among other things, how telepsychology changes the clinician's usual practice or the **client**'s behaviour. Methods: Eight adult participants were seen for 68hours of direct **videoconfer**encing telepsychology over 11 months, and 53 separate points of data for e**ach cl**ient that included the perspectives of b**oth th**e client and **therapist** were** colle**cted. Clients completed technical, process, and therapy-based **satisfact**ion surveys after each session, in addition to standardised clinical symptom rating. Results: This manuscript will summarise some of the project's research findings in relation to specific practice techniques, with a particular focus** on thera**peutic **allianc**e **and satis**faction. Conclusions: In possible contrast to the opinions of those less familiar with telepsychology, we conclude that if telepsychology is not treated apologetically it can **achieve t**herapeutic results, albeit via a different route, favourably comparable to those achieved in face-to-face encounters.  2015 The Australian Psychological Society. eid: 2-s2.0-84937565058
4. **An experimental comparison of telepsychiatry and conventional psychiatry for parolees**
Objective: Many offenders treated for psychiatric disorders while incarcerated are paroled to counties where psychiatric care is limited, leading some correctional departments to offer psychiatric treatment via **videoconfer**encing ("telepsychiatry"). However, the effectiveness of telepsychiatry for offenders with psychiatric disorders has not been rigorously evaluated. Methods: In this randomized field experiment, the authors compared the effectiveness of telepsychiatry and in-person psychiatric sessions (treatment as usual) among 71 parolees receiving outpatient psychiatric treatment over a six-month period. **Satisfact**ion with treatment, **therapeut**ic **allianc**e, medication adherence, and psychological functioning were measured. Follow-up data were collected from 60 of the 71 (85%) patients (N520, telepsychiatry; N540, control condition). Results: Findings revealed h**igh satis**faction with telepsychiatry overall and no significant group differences in medication adherence or psychological functioning. However, telepsychiatry patients reported lower levels** of thera**peu**tic all**iance at follow-up. Conclusions: Telepsychiatry appeared to be an acceptable and effective approach for providing psychiatric care for this population. eid: 2-s2.0-84989933045
5. **The provision of a telepsychology service to Shetland: Client and therapist satisfaction and the ability to develop a therapeutic alliance**
We conducted a pilot study to assess the feasibility and acceptability of **videoconfer**encing as a means of providing a clinical psychology service in the Shetland Islands. A general practitioner was equipped with a desktop PC-based system connected to a mainland hospi**tal videoco**nferencing system by ISDN at 128 kbit/s. Qualitative methods were used to assess user **satisfact**ion, the ability to form a **therapeut**ic relationship and **client** improvement. Over one year, 10 patients (eight female, two male) participated** in the vid**eoconferencing therapy sessions. The psychologist and all but one of **the cl**ients were **high**ly satisfi**ed with the** videoconferencing therapy sessio**ns. Th**e clients were able to **develop** a posit**ive thera**peutic relationship with the psychologist and all reported some improvement from therapy. The resu**lts showed **that videoconferencing is a feasible and acceptable means of providing therapy to patients in remote areas. eid: 2-s2.0-2842610251
6. **Therapeutic alliance in videoconferencing psychotherapy: A review**
Psychotherapy services are limited in remote and **rural** areas in Australia and across the globe. **Videoconfer**encing has become well established as a feasible and acceptable mode of psychological treatment delivery. **Therapeut**ic **allianc**e (TA) is an essential factor underlying successful therapy acr**oss thera**peutic models. In order to determine the state of knowledge regarding TA in psychotherapy **via videoco**nferencing, a literature review was conducted on research studies that formally measured TA as primary, secondary or tertiary outcome measures over the past 23 years. The databases searched were Medline, PsycArticles, PsycINFO, PsycEXTRA and EMBASE. Searching identified 9915 articles that measured **satisfact**ion, acceptabi**lity or t**herapeutic rapport, of which 23 met criteria for the review. Three studies were carried out in Australia, 11 in USA, 4 in Canada, 3 in Scotland and 2 in England. Studies overwhelmingly supported the notion that TA can be **develop**ed in psychothe**rapy by vid**eoconference, with **client**s rating bond and presence at least equally as strongly as in-person settings across a range of diagnostic groups. **Therapist**s also rated **high** levels of TA, but often not quite** as **high as that of th**eir cl**ients early in treatment. The evidence was examined in the context of important aspects of TA, including bond, presen**ce, thera**pist attitudes and abiliti**es, an**d client attitudes and beliefs. Barriers and facilitators** of all**iance were identified. Future studies should include observational measures of bond and presence to supplement self-report.  2014 Natio**nal R**ural** Health** Alliance Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-84916242832
7. **Assessment of the therapeutic alliance in face-to-face or videoconference treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder**
Telepsychotherapy is a cutting-edge intervention that shows great promise in the mental health care field. However, the possibility of **develop**ing a **high**-quality **therapeut**ic **allianc**e is often doubted when psychotherapy is provided remotely. This study assesses **the dev**elopment o**f a thera**peu**tic all**iance in individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder who were treated either by **videoconfer**ence therapy or a face-to-face therapy. Forty-six participants with PTSD received cognitive behavioral therapy, 17 of them** by videoco**nference and 29 **in person**. A variety of questionnaires evaluating the quality** of the t**herapeutic relationship were administered at five different times during treatment. Each session was also assessed by the **therapist** and the participant immediately afterwards. The results indi**cate that** a ther**apeutic** allia**nce can** develop very well in both treatment conditions and that there is no significant difference between the two. Certain clinical and practical implications are discussed.  Copyright 2010, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2010. eid: 2-s2.0-77949735991
8. **The Use of Telehealth by Medical and Other Health Professional Students at a College Counseling Center**
Most college counseling centers do not utilize telehealth despite evidence of positive outcomes. The aim of this study was to examine the telehealth experience of students in a college counseling center. Participants were health professional students who utilized at least one telehealth visit between November 2015 and April 2017 (N=67). Methods: In June 2017, the authors administered a telehealth survey that assessed access, experience, effectiveness, and impact on **therapeut**ic **allianc**e. Of 67 students, 36 (53.7%) responded. The majority reported telehealth was convenient (34, 94.4%), time-saving (34, 94.4%), and helped them to feel better (30, 83.3%). Over half used telehealth because of distance (20, 55.5%). Eighty-one percent reported telehealth as being as good, nearly as good, or no different than meeting **in person**. Conclusion: Telehealth is a viable option for college counseling centers and is experienced as convenient, time-saving, and effective with little negative impact** on thera**peu**tic all**iance.  2018,  2018 Taylor & Francis. eid: 2-s2.0-85052063325

0. **Impact of integrating psychiatric assessment officers via telepsychiatry on rural hospitals' emergency revisit rates**
Objective: To assess the impact of integrating Psychiatric Assessment Officers (PAO) and telepsychiatry in **rural** hospitals on their all-cause **emerg**ency **depart**ment (ED) revisit rates. As a pilot project, a full-time PAO was embedded in each of th**ree r**ural hospitals in New York State and was augmented by telepsychiatry. Method: A retrospective data analysis using ED census data obtained from the hospitals. The intervention group, defined as those patients treated by PAOs, was compared via a difference-in-difference method against a contemporaneous comparison group defined as those who visited the same EDs and had PAO-qualifying behavioral health diagnoses but were not seen by PAOs. Results: The intervention group was associated with an approximately 36% lower all-cause ED revisit rate during the **first** 90-day period (i.e. 190 days) following the initial PAO treatment (p = .003). A reduction of the similar magnitude (44%) persisted into the subsequent 90-day period (i.e., 91180 days since the initial PAO treatment; p < .001). Conclusion: The PAO telepsychiatry pilot program suggests a potential way to provide relief for overburdened** EDs **in rural communities that lack resources to treat patients with severe behavioral health symptoms.  2020 Elsevier Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-85082170593
1. **Emergency Department Telepsychiatry Service Model for a Rural Regional Health System: The First Steps**
Background: **Emerg**ency **depart**ments (EDs) have recognized an increasing number of patients presenting with mental health (MH) concerns. This trend imposes greater demands upon EDs already operating at capacity. Many ED providers do not feel they are optimally prepared to provide the necessary MH care. One consideration in response to this dilemma is to use advanced telemedicine technology for psychiatric consultation. Introduction: We examined a **rural**-and community-based health system operating 21 EDs, none of which has direct access to psychiatric consultation. Dedicated beds to MH range from zero (in EDs with only 3 beds) to 6 (in an ED with 38 beds). Materials and Methods: We conducted a needs assessment of this health system. This included a survey** of e**mergency room providers with a 67% response rate and site visits to directly observe patient flow and communication with ED staff. A visioning workshop provided input from ED staff. Data were also obtained, which reflected ED admissions for the year 2015. Results: The data provide a summary of provider concerns, a summary of MH presentations and diagnosis, and age groupings. The data also provide a time when most MH concerns present to the ED. Discussion: Based upon these results, a proposed model for delivering comprehensive r**egion**al emergency telepsychiatry and behavioral health services is proposed. C**onclu**sions: Emergency telepsychiatry services may be a tenable solution for addressing the shortage of psychiatric consultation to EDs in light of increasing demand for MH treatment in the ED.  2019, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-85059896853
2. **Evaluation and Implementation of a Telepsychiatry Trial in the Emergency Department of a Metropolitan Public Hospital**
Telepsychiatry via video conferencing is not new to mental health but has been expanding at a rapid rate over recent years. Initially it was introduced for treatment in **remot**e and **rural** communities, but it is now being utilized in larger health settings due to increasing patient demand and cost-effectiveness. **Emerg**ency **depart**ments are becoming increasingly burdened, as the workforce cannot keep pace with the rising demand of patient mental health needs. While telepsychiatry has been shown to have treatment efficacy, research is still relatively new, especially within **the e**merge**ncy de**partment context.  2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. eid: 2-s2.0-85029905979
3. **The symbolic affordances of a video-mediated gaze in emergency psychiatry**
While mental illness is a significant health challenge worldwide, the availability of specialists is limited, especially in **rural** areas and for psychiatric **emerg**encies. Although tele-psychiatry, via real-time videoconferencing (VC), is used to provide consultative services in areas that lack psychiatrists, there are a paucity of studies on the use of VC for psychiat**ric e**mergencies. We examine how VC matters for patient involvement and professional practice in the **first** No**rwegi**an emergency tele-psychiatric service. Through a decentralised on-call system, psychiatrists are accessible 24/7 by telephone and VC for patients and nurses in regional psychiatry centres. Based on 29 interviews with patients, psychiatrists and nurses, this article addresses how participation is fostered by VC, and how it may change the social dynamics of **thera**peutic emergency encounters. We identified four contributions of the video-mediated gaze in the therapeutic encounter including those of the: (1) immediacy of assessment, (2) increased transparency, (3) sense of access to the real expert, and (4) fostering of the patient's voice in therapeutic decisions. These VC inflections of the therapeutic encounter are a mix of the pragmatic (1 and 2) and the symbolic (3 and 4), assembling in these contexts to foster patient-centeredness. With a sociological approach to vi**deo-c**onferenced emergency psychiatry, the identification of symbolic affordances adds necessary nuances to the application of new technologies into fragile therapeutic communication.  2017 Elsevier Ltd eid: 2-s2.0-85037345227

5. **Child and Adolescent Emergency and Urgent Mental Health Delivery Through Telepsychiatry: 12-Month Prospective Study**
Background: The significant gap between children and **adolesc**ents presenting for **emerg**ency mental healthcare and the shortage of child **and ado**lescent psychiatrists constitutes a major barrier to timely access for psychiatric assessment for **rural** and **remot**e areas. Unl**ike r**emote areas, ur**ban e**mergency **depart**ments have in-house psychiatric consultation. Telepsychiatry may be a solution to ensure the same serv**ice f**or remote areas. However, there is a paucity of studies on the use of telepsychiatry for child and ado**lesce**nt emergency consults. Thus, the aim of our study was to (1) assess patient satisfaction with telepsychiatry and (2) compare clinical characteristics and outcome of telepsychiatry with f**ace-t**o-face emergency ch**ild and** adolescent assessments. Methods: This is a prospective study of** tele**psychiatry emergency assessments of children and adol**escen**ts referred by emergency physicians. The comparison group was age- and gender-matched patients seen for face-to-face urgent assessments. Data were gathered on demographic and clinical variables. Telepsychiatry satisfaction was assessed using a questionnaire. Descriptive statistics and chi-square tests were used to assess group differences for each variable. Logistic regression was used to assess impact of the variables on outcome after the consult. A p value <0.05 was used to determine statistical significance. Results: Sixty (n = 60) assessments were conducted through telepsychiatry in 12 months. Among the telepsychiatry group, Aboriginal patients were over-represented (50% vs. 6.7%, p < 0.001), a higher proportion received a diagnosis of adjustment disorder (22% vs. 8.3%, p = 0.004) or no diagnosis (27% vs. 6.7%, p = 0.004) compared with controls. There was no statistically significant difference between groups on other clinical variables. Patients reported a high degree of satisfaction with telepsychiatry.

6. **Reduced Unplanned Care and Disease Activity and Increased Quality of Life After Patient Enrollment in an Inflammatory Bowel Disease Medical Home**
Background & Aims: Specialty medical homes (SMHs) are a new health care model in which a multidisciplinary team and specialists manage patients with chronic diseases. As part of a large integrated payerprovider network, we formed an inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) SMH and investigated its effects on health care use, disease activity, and quality of life (QoL). Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of 322 patients (58% female; mean age, 34.6 y; 62% with Crohn's disease; 32% with prior IBD surgery) enrolled in an IBD SMH, in conjunction with the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Health Plan, from June 2015 through July 2016. Patients had at least 1 year of follow up. We evaluated changes in numbers of **emerg**ency **depart**ment visits and hospitalizations from the year before vs after SMH enrollment. Secondary measures included IBD activity assessments and QoL. Results: Compared to the year before IBD SMH enrollment, patients had a 47.3% reduction** in e**merge**ncy de**partment visits (P <.0001) and a 35.9% reduction in hospitalizations (P =.008). In the year following IBD SMH enrollment, patients had significant reductions in the median HarveyBradshaw Index score (reduced from 4 to 3.5; P =.002), and median ulcerative colitis activity index score (from 4 to 3; P =.0003), and increases in QoL (median short inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire score increased from 50 to 51.8; P <.0001). Patients in the most extreme (highest and lowest) quartiles had the most improvement when we compared scores at baseline vs after enrollment. Based on multivariable regression analysis, use of corticosteroids (odds ratio [OR], 2.72; 95% CI, 1.325.66; P =.007) or opioids (OR, 3.20; 95% CI, 1.327.78; P =.01), and low QoL (OR, 4.44; 95% CI, 1.0818.250; P =.04) at enrollment were significantly associated with per**siste**nt em**ergenc**y department visits and hospitalizations. Conclusions: We found development of an IBD SMH to be feasible and significantly reduce unplanned care and disease activity and increase patient QoL 1 year after enrollment.  2018 AGA Institute eid: 2-s2.0-85050114456
7. **A transferable telepsychiatry model for improving access to emergency mental health care**
The Mental Health **Emerg**ency Care-**Rural** Access Programme (MHEC) aims to improve access to special**ist e**mergency mental health care** in r**ural and **remot**e communities in New South Wales. It provides a range of services in**cludi**ng emergency telephone triage and video assessment. The present report provides a detailed description of the structure and function of the MHEC model, and identifies matters concerning adaptation and transferability. Structure: the MHEC can be contacted 24 hours/day, every day of the year; no caller is refused assistance. Function: the MHEC provides information services, clinical services and other programme activities. Adaptation of the model and implementation elsewhere (transferability) should be informed by local needs, existing practices and the components of access. The programme has already attracted the attention of two other regions in Australia interested in i**mplem**enting emergency telepsychiatry programmes. The MHEC model is a practical solution for improving acces**s to **specialist emergency mental health care in underserved areas.

8. **No longer 'flying blind': How access has changed emergency mental health care in rural and remote emergency departments, a qualitative study**
Background: Mental health presentations are considered to be a difficult aspect of **emerg**ency care. Altho**ugh e**mergency **depart**ment (ED) staff is qualified to **provi**de emergency mental health care, for some, such presentations pose a challenge to their training, confidence, and time. Providing access to relevant and responsive specialist mental health care can influence care and management for these patients. The Me**ntal **Health Emergency Care-**Rural** Access Program (MHEC-RAP) is a telepsychiatry program that was established to improve acces**s to **specialist emergency mental health care acr**oss r**ural and **remot**e western NSW, Australia. Method: This study uses interviews with ED providers to understand their exp**erien**ce of managing emergency mental health patients and their use of MHEC-RAP. The lens of access was applied to assess program impact and inform continuing program development. Results: With MHEC-RAP, these ED providers are no longer 'flying blind'. They are also more confident** to m**anage and care for emergency mental health patients locally. For these providers, access to specialists who are able to conduct assessments and provide relevan**t and** responsive advice for emergency mental health presentations was valued. Assessing the fit between the consumer and service as a requirement for the development, evaluation, and ongoing management of the service should result in decisions about design and delivery that achieve improved access to care and meet the needs of their consumers. The experience of these providers prior to MHEC-RAP is consistent with that reported i**n oth**er rural **and r**emote populations suggesting that MHEC-RAP could address limitations in access to specialist c**are a**nd change the provision of emergency mental health care elsewhere. Conclusion: MHEC-RAP has not only provided access to specialist mental health care for local ED providers, but it has changed their practice and perspective. MHEC-RAP could be adapted for implementation elsewhere. Provider experience confirms that the program is accessible and offers insights to th**ose c**onsidering how to establish an emergency telepyschiatry service in other settings.  2015 Saurman et al.; licensee BioMed Central. eid: 2-s2.0-84928798574
9. **Assessing program efficiency: A time and motion study of the mental health emergency care - Rural access program in NSW Australia**
The Mental Health **Emerg**ency Care-**Rural** Access Program (MHEC-RAP) is a telehealth solution providing special**ist e**mergency mental health care** to r**ural and **remot**e communities across western NSW, Australia. This is the **first** time and motion (T&M) study to examine program efficiency and capacity for a telepsychiatry program. Clinical services are an integral aspect of the program accounting for 6% of all activities and 50% of the time spent conducting program activities, but half of this time is spent completing clinical paperwork. This finding emphasizes the importance of these services to program efficiency and the need to address variability of service provision to impact capacity. Currently, there is no efficiency benchm**ark f**or emergency telepsychiatry programs. Findings suggest that MHEC-RAP could increase its activity without affecting program responsiveness. T&M studies not only determine activity and time expenditure, but have a wider application assessing program efficiency by understanding, defining, and calculating capacity. T&M studies can inform future program development of MHEC-RAP and similar telehealth programs, both in Australia and overseas.  2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland. eid: 2-s2.0-84905643979
10. **Telemental health evaluations enhance access and efficiency in a critical access hospital emergency department**
Introduction: Mentally ill patients in crisis presenting to critical access hospital **emerg**ency rooms often face exorbitant wait times to be evaluated by a trained mental health provider. Patients may be discharged from the hospital before receiving an evaluation or boarded in a hospital bed for observation, reducing quality and increasing costs. This study examined the effectiveness of** an e**mergency telemental health evaluation service implemented in a **rural** h**ospit**al emergency room. Materials and Methods: Retrospective data collection was implemented to consider patients presen**ting **to the emergency room for 212 days prior to telemedicine interventions and for 184 days after. The study compared measures of time to treatment, length of stay (regardless of inpatient or outpatient status), and door-to-consult time. Results: There were 24 patients seen before telemedicine was implemented and 38 seen using telemedicine. All patients had a mental health evaluation ordered by a physician and completed by a mental health specialist. Significant reductions in all three time measures were observed. Mean and median times to consult were reduced from 16.2 h (standard deviation=13.2 h) and 14.2 h, respectively, to 5.4 h (standard deviation=6.4 h) and 2.6 h. Similar reductions in length of stay and door-to-consult times were observed. By t tests, use of telemedicine was associated with a statistically significant reduction in all three outcome measures. Conclusions: Telemedicine appears to be an effective intervention for mentally ill patients by providing more timely access to mental health evaluations in** rura**l hospital emergency **depart**ments.  2014 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-84903607877
11. **Successful provision of emergency mental health care to rural and remote New South Wales: An evaluation of the Mental Health Emergency Care-Rural Access Program**
Objective To evaluate a **rural** **emerg**ency telepsychiatry program, the Mental Hea**lth E**mergency C**are-R**ural Access Program (MHEC-RAP), which aims to improve ac**cess **to emergency mental health care for communities throughout western New South Wales (NSW). Methods A descriptive analysis of service activity data from the introduction of the MHEC-RAP in 2008 to 2011 using Chi-squared tests and linear regression modelling to assess change and trends over time. Result There were 55959 calls to the MHEC-RAP, 9678 (17%) of these calls initiated an MHEC-RAP service (2500 each year). The use of video assessment increased over 18 months, then levelled off to an average of 65 each month. Health care provider use increased from 54% to 75% of all contacts, and 49% of MHEC-RAP patients were triaged 'urgent'. Most (71%) were referred from the MHEC-RAP for outpatient care with a local provider. The proportion of MHEC-RAP patients admitted to hospital initially increased by 12%, then declined over the next 2 years by 7% (by 28% for admissions to a mental health inpatient unit (MHIPU)). Conclusion The MHEC-RAP is well established. It has achieved acceptable levels of service activity and continues to be as used as intended. Further research is required to confirm how the MHEC-RAP works in terms of process and capacity, how it has changed access to mental health care and to document its costs and benefits. What is known about the** topi**c? Rural and **remot**e communities have poorer access to and use of **mental health servic**es. Telehealth care is a reliable and accepted means for providing non-urgent mental health care. What does this paper add? The MHEC-RAP is a practical and transferable solution to providing** spec**ialist emergency mental health care, and support for local pr**ovide**rs, in rural **and r**emote areas via telehealth. There is a possible impact upon the problem of recruiting and retaining a mental heal**th wo**rkforce in ru**ral a**nd remote areas. What are the implications for practitioners? Providi**ng re**liable remote access to specialist mental health assessment and advice while supp**ortin**g providers in rural communities can result in better outcomes for patients and services alike.

12. **Telepsychiatry in emergency consultations: A follow-up study of sixty patients**
The objective was to investigate how telepsychiatry works in the assessment of psychiatric **emerg**ency patients. Sixty consecutive patients referred to the acute open ward having their **first** psychiatric contact through the videolink with the psychiatrist on duty. Only minor technical problems occurred. The results suggest both acceptance and satisfaction on the part of patients and staff with new technology, instead of waiting for a consultation or traveling to see a psychiatrist in face-to-face meeting. Telepsychiatry seems to be suitable for the assessment of psychiat**ric e**mergency patients, and satisfactory for patients and staff alike.  Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-25844509864
13. **Telepsychiatry: An island pilot project**
A telemedicine link was established in 1996 between the island of Inishmore and the **depart**ment of psychiatry in University College Hospital, Galway. The link was mainly used to facilitate **emerg**ency consultations between patients on the island and the duty psychiatrist, always at the request of the island's general practitioner. Nine patients were referred for assessment in this manner over eight months. Three patients had their **first** psychiatric contact and assessment through the video-link, and were followed up as outpatients via the link to eventual resolution of the episode of illness and discharge at the outpatient clinic. Our experience has been that videoconferencing systems are acceptable and satisfactory for patients and staff alike. eid: 2-s2.0-0031610061
14. **Emergency management guidelines for telepsychiatry**
Objective: Telepsychiatry, in the form of live interactive videoconferencing, is an **emerg**ing application **for e**mergency psychiatric assessment and treatment and can improve the quality and quantity of **mental health servic**es, particularly for **rural**, **remot**e and isolated populations. Despite the poten**tial **of emergency telepsychiatry, the literature has been fairly limited in this area. Method: Drawing on the combined clinical and administrative experiences of its authors, this article reviews the common administrative, legal/ethical and clinical issues th**at ar**ise in emergency telepsychiatry. Results: An initial set of** guid**elines for emergency telepsychiatry is presented to generate further discussion to assist those who are considering establishing general te**lepsy**chiatry and/or emergency telepsychiatry services. Conclusion: The prac**tices** and techniques of emergency telepsychiatry are relatively new and require further examination, modification and refinement so that they may be fully utilized within comprehens**ive mental health se**rvice systems.  2007 Elsevier Inc.

15. **Emergency telepsychiatry**
Telepsychiatry can be used in two kinds of psychiatric **emerg**encies: one-time clinical events and public health situations associated with mass disast**er. E**mergency telepsychiatry delivered by videoconferencing has the potential to improve patient care in many settings. Although experience is limited, it has been found to be safe and effective, as well as satisfactory **to bo**th emergency **depart**ment staff and the psychiatric patients treated. The development of comprehensive and standardized guidelines is necessary. There has been little use of acute telemedicine in disaster situations to date. However, telemedicine is becoming part** of r**outine emergency medical response planning in many** juri**sdictions. Emergency telepsychiatry has the **poten**tial to reduce emerge**ncy de**partment overcrowding, provide much needed care in **rural** areas and improve access to psychiatric care in the event of a natural or manmade disaster. eid: 2-s2.0-58149130136
16. **A comparison study of the turnaround time for telepsychiatry versus face-to-face consultations in general hospital nonpsychiatric emergency rooms**
background: Psychiatric consultation services, particularly for **emerg**encies, are limited in many parts of the United States. Telepsychiatry services are helping to bridge the gap, and are gaining acceptance and popularity. There is paucity of publications regarding comparison of turnaround time for consultations between video conferencing and traditional face-to-face psychiatric consultations in general hospital nonpsychiat**ric e**mergency **depart**ments (EDs). Our study aimed to address turnaround time and patient satisfaction. methods: Data regarding the turnaround t**ime f**or emergency psychiatric consultations using telepsychiatry in general hospital EDs was collected retrospectively and compared with the time for face-to-face traditional consultations. A patient satisfaction survey was also conducted after the telepsychiatry consultation. Statistical analysis of the data was done after the study was completed. results: The telepsychiatry group included 206 participants and the control group had 186 participants. There was an 84% reduction in the turnaround time for telepsychiatry consults (95% confidence interval, 81% to 86%). A patient satisfaction survey showed 97% satisfaction with telepsychiatry services. Gender and age did not modify the effect of telepsychiatry on time to consult (P > .10). conclusions: The reduction in the turnaround time and improved patient satisfaction indicate that telepsychiatry services can improve the quality of care for patients** in n**eed of emergency services.  2020 Quadrant Healthcom Inc..

0. **Telepsychiatry clinical decision support system used by non-psychiatrists in remote areas: Validity & reliability of diagnostic module**
Background & objectives: A knowledge-based, logically-linked online telepsychiatric decision support system for diagnosis and treatment of mental disorders was developed and validated. We evaluated diagnostic accuracy and reliability of the application at remote sites when used by non-psychiatrists who underwent a **brief** training in its use through video-conferencing. Methods: The study was conducted at a nodal telepsychiatry centre, and three geographically remote peripheral centres. The diagnostic tool of application had a screening followed by detailed criteria-wise diagnostic modules for 18 psychiatric disorders. A total of 100 consecutive consenting adult outpatients attending remote telepsychiatry centres were included. To assess inter-**rate**r reliability, patients were **interview**ed **face to fac**e by non-specialists at remote sites using the application (act**ive inter**viewer) and simultaneously on online application via video-conferencing by a passive assessor at nodal centre. **Another i**nterviewer at the nodal cen**tre **rated the patient using Mini-International Neuro**psychiatr**ic Interview (MINI) for diagnostic validation. Results: Screening sub-module had **high** sensitivity (80-100%), low positive predictive values (PPV) (0.10-0.71) **but **high negative predictive value (NPV) (0.97-1) for most disorders. For the diagnostic sub-modules, Cohens kappa was >0.4 for all disorders, with kappa of 0.7-1.0 for most disorders. PPV and N**PV w**ere high for most disorders**. In**ter-rater **agreement** analysis revealed kappa >0.6 for all disorders. Interpretation & conclusions: Diagnostic tool showed acceptable to good validity and reliability when used by non-specialists at remote sites. Our findings show that diagnostic tool of the telepsychiatry application has potential to empower non-psychiatrist doctors and paramedics to diagnose psychiatric di**sord**ers accurately and **reliabl**y in remote sites.  2017, Indian Council of Medical Research.

1. **A novel screening and diagnostic tool for child and adolescent psychiatric disorders for telepsychiatry**
Background: A diagnostic tool designed as part of a telepsychiatry application for diagnosis and management of child and adolescent psychiatric disorders in India was developed considering the paucity of trained child psychiatrists and mental health professionals in India. Materials and Methods: The diagnostic tool consisted of screening and 10 th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10) criteria-based diagnostic algorithms for 18 psychiatric disorders seen in childhood and adolescence. Accuracy of diagnoses and feasibility of use of the tool was examined by comparing it with detailed semi-structured clinical evaluations by a qualified psychiatrist with 50 psychiatric patients (children and adolescents). Statistical Analysis: Descriptive analyses and paired t-tests were conducted to compare the mean number of diagnosis gene**rate**d by the two **interview**s. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values were computed for the screening and the diagnostic sub-modules of the tool, compared to the clinical diagnoses. Kappa coefficients were computed to assess **agreement** between the diagnoses **gene**rated by the diagnostic sub-module and the clinical diagnoses. Results: The screening sub-module had **high** sensitivi**ty, **high specificity and negative predictive values for all disorders. For the diagnostic sub-module, there **was **moderate (kappa-0.4-0.6) to substant**ial agree**ment (kappa &gt; 0.6) for all the disorders, (except psychos**is) **and high sensitivity (barring a few disorders) and specificity for almost all the disorders. Positive predictive values were found to be ac**cept**able to high for most disorders, wi**th c**onsistently high negative predictive values. Conclusion: The new tool was found to be comprehensive, reasonably short and feasible. Results showed acceptable level of accuracy in di**agno**sis generated by the tool. eid: 2-s2.0-84994807407
2. **Application of telepsychiatry: A preliminary study**
Telemedicine is the provision of professional medical services from sites removed from the patient. This study was conducted in order to assess the reliability of psychiatric evaluations via video-consultation. The inter- **rate**r reliability was determined for each **interview**ing condition by employing the reliability-testing paradigm in which the **brief** psychiatric rating scale (BPRS) and the interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) are used. The int**er- **rater reliability scores between face-to-f**ace inter**vi**ews and i**nterviews conducted by video at two different levels of image qualities were compared by the authors. Reliability was found to be in perfect **agreement** in **each of t**he interviewing conditions. This study verifies that telepsychiatry is a **reliabl**e method of assessing patient conditions. It may be used to provide much needed mental health-care services to patients whose access to them is restricted. eid: 2-s2.0-0034014241
3. **The reliability of telepsychiatry for a neuropsychiatric assessment**
Objective: To determine whether or not the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS), an examination that relies on visual judgments, can be **reliabl**y measured via video conferencing equipment. Methods: AIMS scores were assessed by two independent **rate**rs in face-to-face contact with the subject and **two **raters observing remotely via audio-visual transmission. We determine**d in**ter-rater reliabilities using the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC). We assessed if the condi**tion** of the rater influenced the ICC. We distinguished betw**een **whether the rater was physically in the room with the subject or was connected via video. We then statistically compared the differences between these conditions. Results: There were no significant statistical diff**eren**ces between the raters, which could be attributed to the condition while assessing involuntary movements using the AIMS instrument. Regardless of whether this assessment was conducted by direct observation or via video conferencing equipment, the results w**ere rel**iable to the same degree. Conc**lusion:** Reliable neuropsychiatric assessments can be conducted using telemedicine even if primarily visual input is evaluated.  Copyright 2011, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-79955081873
4. **Telemedicine and geriatric psychiatry: Directions for future research and policy**
The use of **telecommun**ications to provide mental health services at a distance has grown rapidly in the past 10 years. The overall experience has been positive, but evaluations and reliability studies have been preliminary. A fundamental question of what constitutes adequate technology for telepsychiatry remains unanswered. As technology and equipment capability change rapidly, a more important question may be what clinical decisions and behavioral observations are required to produce **high** standards of distance mental health care. Geriatric patients may have sensory impairments and unique aspects to their psychiatric problems that can make telemental health assessments more challenging. It is not clear what model of telepsychiatry constitutes the best practice for geriatric psychiatry. Future research and program evaluations should address these questions to guide the use of telepsychiatry in productive directions. eid: 2-s2.0-0034965345
5. **Development of a novel diagnostic system for a telepsychiatric application: A pilot validation study**
Background: A net-based, decision support system for diagnostic assessment and management of psychiatric disorders, developed as part of a telepsychiatry service, which aims to deliver mental health care to underserved population of remote areas in India is described. This paper presents the development and preliminary results of diagnostic validation of the application, intended for use among adult patients. The bilingual (English and Hindi) diagnostic tool consists of a core diagnostic section comprising a screening sub-module and criteria-based diagnostic sub-modules for 18 adult psychiatric disorders, and additional sections covering background information. The diagnostic tool of the application was examined among 100 consecutive consenting adult outpatients, by comparing it with detailed semi-structured clinical assessments led by a consultant psychiatrist, on accuracy of diagnoses gene**rate**d, and examining the feasibility of its use. Results: The screening sub-module had **high** sensitivity **and **high specificity, low positive predictive valu**es, **but high negative predictive values for most disorders. For the diagnostic sub-modules, there was **mode**rate (kappa = 0.4-0.6), to substantial **agreement** (kappa > 0.6) between diagno**ses **generated by the tool and consultants' diagnoses, for all the disorders except dysthymia. Sens**itiv**ity was high barring a few disorders. **Spec**ificity was high for all the disorders, positive predictive values** wer**e acceptable to high for most disorders, and negative predictive v**alue**s were consistently high.** Com**pletion rate was 100%; average time taken was five minutes for screening alone, and 30 minutes for complete assessment with screening and criteria-based evaluation. A majority of the patients, their relatives, and **interview**ers were satisfied with **the inter**view. Conclusions: The preliminary results indicated that despite some limitations, the new diagnostic system was reasonably comprehensive, time-efficient and feasible, with an acceptable level of diagnostic accuracy. Hence, it appeared to be suitable for use as a telepsychiatric application.  2014 Malhotra et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd. eid: 2-s2.0-84906923585
6. **Reliability of telepsychiatry assessments: Subjective versus observational ratings**
Geriatric patients in underserved areas could benefit from the use of **telecommun**ications to expand access to mental health services. It is important to determine the clinical limitations of using videoconferencing for psychiatric assessments, particularly in the elderly. The goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that videoconferencing ratings based on visual observations of behavior would be less **reliabl**e than ratings based on patients' verbal reports of symptoms. Videoconferencing assessments of 30 geriatric patients using low-bandwidth (ISDN) equipment were compared to gold standard face-to-face assessments. The **Brief** Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) was dichotomized into subjective items based on patients' verbal reports and observational items based on visual ratings of behavior. Reliability of the BPRS subjective items was consistently **high**er than for the observational items. Future studies should emphasize the accuracy of telemedicine ratings that require visual observation of behavior, which is crucial to clinical assessment of psychogeriatric conditions. eid: 2-s2.0-0034970335
7. **Telepsychiatry: Assessment of televideo psychiatric interview reliability with present- and next-generation internet infrastructures**
Objective: We assessed the reliability of remote video psychiatric **interview**s conducted via the internet using narrow and broad bandwidths. Method: Televideo psychiat**ric inter**views conducted with 42 in-patients with chronic schizophrenia using two bandwidths (narrow, 128 kilobits/s; broad, 2 megabits/s) were assessed in terms of **agreement** with face-**to-face i**nterviews in a test-retest fashion. As a contr**ol, agree**ment was assessed between f**ace-to-fa**ce interviews. Psychiatric symptoms were **rate**d using the Oxford version of the **Brief** Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPR**S), and a**g**reement b**etween interviews was estimated as the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Results: The ICC was significantly lower in the narrow bandwidth than in the broad bandwidth and the control for both positive symptoms score and total score. Conclusion: While reliability of te**levideo p**sychiatric interviews is insufficient using the present narrow-band internet infrastructure, the next generation of infrastructure (broad-band) may permit ****reliabl****e diagnostic interviews. eid: 2-s2.0-0034893102
8. **Diagnostic reliability of telepsychiatry in American Indian veterans**
Objective: This study examined the reliability of the Structured Clinical **Interview** for DSM-III-R (SCID) in the administration of psychiatric assessments by real-time videoconferencing compared to face-to-face assessment within a rural American Indian community. Method: The SCID was administered to 53 male American Indian veterans who were randomly assigned over two sepa**rate** occasions by differ**ent inter**viewers to face-to-face and real-time interactive videoconferencing within 2 weeks. Comparisons were made with prevalences, the McNemar test, and the kappa statistic. Results: With the exception of past-year substance dependence and abuse/dependence combined, there were no significant differences between face-to-face and videoconference administration. The majority of kappas calculated (76%) indicated a good or fair level of **agreement**. Externalizing disorders tended to elicit greater concordance than internalizing disorders. Conclusions: Overall, SCID assessment by live interactive videoconferencing did not differ significantly from face-to-face assessment in this population. Videoconferencing is a viable vehicle for clinical and research purposes. eid: 2-s2.0-33846502249

Introduction: The mental and physical health of individuals with a psychotic illness are typically poor. When **adher**ed to, medication can reduce relapse. However, desp**ite a**dherence, relapse remains common and **function**al outcomes often remain compromised. Compliance is also typically low. Cardiovascular-related morbidity and mortality is also elevated, along with several important modifiable health risk behaviours. Access to psychosocial interventions is therefore important, but currently limited. **Telephon**e delivered interventions represent a promising solution, although further clarity is needed. Accordingly, we aim to provide an overview and critical analysis of the current state of evidence **for tele**phone delivered psychosocial interventions targeting key health priorities in adults with a psychotic disorder, including (1) relap**se, (**2) adherence to psychiatric medication and/or (3) modifiable cardiovascular health risk behaviours. Methods and analysis: Our methods are informed by published guidelines. The review is registered and any protocol amendments will be tracked. Ten electronic peer-reviewed and four grey literature databases have been identified. Preliminary searches have been conducted for literature on psych**osocial **telephone interventions targeting relapse,** medi**cation adherence and/or health risk behaviours in adults with a psychotic disorder. Articles classified as 'evaluation' will be assessed against standardised criteria and checked by an independent assessor. The searches will be re-run just before final analyses and further studies retrieved for inclusion. A narrative synthesis will be reported, structured around intervention type and content, population characteristics and outcomes. Where possible, 'summary of findings' tables will be generated for each comparison. For the primary outcome of each trial, when data are available, we will calculate a risk ratio and its 95% CI (dichotomous outcomes) and/or effect size according to Cohen's formula (continuous outcomes). Ethics and dissemination: No ethical issues are foreseen. Findings will be disseminated widely to clinicians and researchers via journal publication and conference presentation(s).

Objective: This randomized-controlled experimental study was conducted to determine the effects of **psychoeduc**ation in the clinic and **regular** **telepsychiatr**ic follow-up (via **telephon**e) after discharge on social **function**ing, drug **adher**ence of patients with schziophrenia. Methods: This study was performed on totally 62 patients, assigned to experiment (n=32) and control (n=30) groups, from 1st July 2010 to 31st May 2011, being followed in Mental Health Center of Kayseri Training and Research Hospital and meeting research criteria. Patients' characteristics were recorded by a form. For the patients in experiment and control groups; before education, after education and after 6-mon**ths tele**phone follow-up Scales of Medicat**ion A**dherence Rating, Soc**ial Func**tioning were applied. In **the psycho**education process, the patients in the experiment group were given 'Manual of Information for Patients with Schziophrenia' prepared by the researcher. After discharge, patients were intervi**ewed by **telephone for 6 months, every w**eek reg**ularly in average for 15 minutes. A standard, semi-structured interview form consisting of 7 questions we**re used **for telephone follow-up. Results: For the patients in the experiment group, after physc**hoeducat**ion and telephone follow-up, the mean sco**res f**or adherence to treatment and** social **functioning scores were increased, the differences between before and after **educatio**n and after telephone follow-up were significant. Again, the differences between the mea**n sco**res of adherence to treatment** and soc**ial functioning were significant af**ter educ**ation and after telephone follow-up for the patients in both experiment and control groups. In addition, the group and time interaction of the **mean **scores for adherence to treat**ment and** social functioning were significant. Conclusion: According to these resul**ts, the ps**ychoeducation and te**lepsychi**atric follow-up via telephone i**nduce**d increases in adherence to t**reatment** and social functioning for the patients. Supporting the patients with **schizoph**renia** vi**a psychoeducation **and telepsych**iatric follow-up had positive impact on these patients and these techniques are recommended to be used in patient follow-up at home. eid: 2-s2.0-84885139707
2. **Tecla: A telephone- and text-message based telemedical concept for patients with severe mental health disorders - study protocol for a controlled, randomized, study**
Background: Severe mental disorders like psychotic disorders including **schizophrenia** and schizoaffective disorders have a 12-month-prevalence of 2.6, bipolar disorders of 1.5 % in Germany. The relapse risk is high; so many patients need intensive monitoring and lifelong treatment. A high medication **adher**ence is essential for a successful treatment. But in practice, medicat**ion a**dherence is low and decreases over time. Telemedical care concepts might improve treatment and bridge gaps between in- and outpatient treatment. A telemedical care concept based on **regular** **telephon**e calls and short text messages was developed. The primary objective is to assess whether regu**lar tele**phone calls and text messages can improve the med**icati**on adherence of patients. Secondary objectives are the reduction of rehospitalization rates, the improvement of quality of life and of the severity of symptoms. Methods/design: The Tecla study (Post stationary telemedical care of patients with severe psychiatric disorders) is a two-armed prospective randomized controlled trial. The participants in the intervention group receive in addition to usual car**e **reg**ular **telephone calls every 2 weeks and weekly text messages on patient-individual topics during a 6 months period. Patients in the control group recei**ve only** regular care. Inclusion criteria are a physician-diagnosed bipolar disorder, schizoaffective disorder** or schizophr**enia and a signed informed consent. Exclusion criteria are planned inpatient treatments within the next 6 months and being non-reachable by phone. After 3 and 6 months both groups receive **follow up** assessments. Discussion: The primary objective of this study is the** medi**cation adherence that is measured with** the **Medication Adherence Report Scale, German version (MARS-D). The MARS-D is a self-repo**rt wi**th five items. Adherent behaviour is mostly overestimated using self-reports. The strength of the **MARS-**D is to detect non-adherent behavio**ur. T**he original Medication Adherence Report Scale in English language (MARS-5) was developed to encourage the patient to answer truthfully to the questions that are asked in a non-threatening and non-judgmental way to minimize social des**irabi**lity bias in admitting non-adherent behaviour.  2015 Stentzel et al. eid: 2-s2.0-84946030711
3. **Effect of psychoeducation and telepsychiatric follow up given to the caregiver of the schizophrenic patient on family burden, depression and expression of emotion**
Objective: This randomized-controlled experimental study was conducted to determine the effects of **psychoeduc**ation in the inpatient clinic and **regular** **telepsychiatr**ic follow-up (via **telephon**e) after discharge on emotional expression, depression and family burden of primary caregivers of the schizophrenic patients. Methods: This study was performed on 62 caregivers of the schizophrenic patients, assigned to experiment (n=32) and control (n=30) groups, from 1st July 2010 to 31st May 2011. The Scales for Expressed Emotion, the Beck Depression and the Zarit Family Burden were applied for the caregivers in experiment and control groups before education, after education and after 6-mon**ths tele**phone follow-up. Results: The mean scores of the caregivers in experiment group on family burden, emotional expression and depression were decreased after education an**d after **telephone follow-up and difference was significant (p &lt; 0.001). Conclusio**ns: Psycho**education **and telepsych**iatric fo**llow-up **via telephone induced decrease in family burden, emotional expression and depressive symptoms for their caregivers and was a support for the family in the patient care. eid: 2-s2.0-84881589469

0. **Telepsychiatry as an economically better model for reaching the unreached: A retrospective report from South India**
Aim: In a resource-poor country such as India, telepsychiatry could be an **econom**ical method to expand health-care services. This study was planned to compare the **cost**ing and feasibility of three different service delivery models. The end user was a state-funded long-stay Rehabilitation Center (RC) for the homeless. Methodology: Model A comprised patients going to a tertiary care center for clinical care, Model B was community outreach service, and Model C comprised telepsychiatry services. **The **costing included expenses incurred by the health system to complete a single consultation for a patient on an outpatient basis. It specifically exclu**ded **the cost borne by the care-receiver. No patients were interviewed for the study. Results: The RC had 736 inmates, of which 341 had mental illness of very long duration. On co**mpar**ing the c**osti**ng, Model A costed 6047.5 **INR **(100$), Model B costed 577.1 **INR **(9.1$), and Model C costed 137.2 INR (2.2$). Model C was found fifty times m**ore ec**onomical when compared to Model A and four tim**es mor**e economical when compared to Model B. Conclusion: Telepsychiatry services connecting tertiary center and a primary health-care center have potenti**al to **be an economical model of service delivery compared to other traditional ones. This resource needs to be tapped in a better fashion to reach the unreached.  2017 Indian Psychiatric Society. eid: 2-s2.0-85020217210
1. **An economic cost analysis of an expanding, multi-state behavioural telehealth intervention**
Introduction: In this paper the **econom**ic **cost**s associated with a growing, multi-state telepsychiatry intervention serving rural American Indian/Alaska Native populations were compared** to **costs of **travel**ling to provide/receive in-person treatment. Methods: Telepsy**chia**try costs were calculated using administrative, information-technology, equipment and technology components, and were compare**d t**o** tr**avel cost models. Both a **patien**t travel and a p**sychia**trist travel model were estimated utilising ArcGIS so**ftwa**re and unit costs gathered from literature and **gove**rnment sources. Cost structure and sensitivity **analysi**s was also calculated by varying modeling parameters and assumptions. Results and Discussion: It is est**imat**ed that per-session costs were $93.90, $183.34, and $268.23 for telemed**icine,** provider-**travel**, and patient-travel, respectively. Restricting **the ana**lysis to satellite locations with a larger number of visits reduced telemed**icin**e per-patient encounter costs (50 or more visits: $83.52; 100 or more visits: $80.41; and 150 or more** vis**its: $76.25). The estimated cost efficiencies of telemedicine were more evident for highly rural communities. Finally, we found that a multi-state centre was cheaper than each state operating independently. Conclusions: Consistent with previous research, this study provides additional evidence of **the ec**onomic efficiency associated with telemedicine interventions for rural American Indian/Alaska Native populations. Our results suggest that th**ere ar**e economies of scale in providing behavioural telemedicine and that bigger, multi-state tele**medi**cine centres have lower overall costs compared to smaller, state-level centres. Additionally, results suggest that telemedicine structures with a higher number of per-**sate**llite patient encounters have lower costs, and telemedicine centres delivering care to highly rural populations prod**uce gr**eater economic benefits.

2. **Economic evaluation of a tertiary telepsychiatry service to an island**
The island of Jersey is located 160km south of Britain and 23km from northwest France. The island has wellestablished primary and secondary **mental health servic**es, but tertiary services have to be purchased from UK mainland service providers. A pilot study of telepsychiatry was conducted, using videoconferencing to access terti**ary mental health se**rvices from the UK. During a six-month study period, five patient consultations and six specialist presentations were carried out. The total **cost** of using videoconferencing to deliver t**ertiary mental healt**h services not ordinarily available in Jersey was 3483.06. **The **costs of using the traditional model instead would have been 12,975.00. The threshold at which videoconferencing became cheaper than **travel** was between five and six telemedicine episodes per **year**; the actual workload during the pilot study was 22 episodes **per **year. The study suggests that telemedi**cine** is cost-effective for providi**ng tertiary mental h**ealth services not ordinarily available in Jersey. eid: 2-s2.0-39049175410
3. **Evaluation of a routine telepsychiatry service**
An assessment was undertaken of a routine telepsychiatry service in rural areas of a Canadian province as a follow-up to a pilot telepsychiatry project. Over two **year**s, there were 546 consultations at the five participating general hospitals, although the level of use varied considerably between them. Health professionals expressed high satisfaction with the service. While there were equipment problems in 17% of all consultations in the sec**ond **year, they did not seem to affect acceptance of the technique. A **cost** **analysi**s comparing consultations provided by a visiting psychiatrist and telepsychiatry found a break-even point of 348 consulta**tion**s a year. However, when use of the videoconferencing network for administrative meetings was considered, the break-even point was 224 cons**ulta**tions a year, substantially below the actual utilization of telepsychiatry. Telepsychiatry appeared to result in increased access to community **mental health servic**es, suggesting future increased demand for these. From the perspective of health authorities and health professionals, telepsychiatry proved to be a useful and sustainable addition to exist**ing mental health se**rvices. eid: 2-s2.0-0035222533
4. **Evaluation of a telepsychiatry pilot project**
We assessed a telepsychiatry pilot project in which a psychiatric hospital was linked with mental health clinics in five general hospitals. Information was collected through questionnaires administered to patients, service providers and psychiatric consultants, and by interviews. The technology was considered easy to use by participating health-care professionals and patients, and the quality of the sound and picture was adequate. Survey data suggested acceptance and satisfaction on the part of patients, service providers and psychiatric consultants. An **econom**ic **analysi**s indicated that at 396 consultations per **year** the service **cost** the same as providing a **travel**ling psychiatrist (C$610 per consultation); with more consultations, telepsychiatry was cheaper. Information gathered during the **evalu**ation suggested that the use of videoconferencing for psychiatric consultations was a viable option for an integrated, community-based **mental health servic**e. eid: 2-s2.0-0032616627

0. **A comparison of psychiatrist evaluation and patient symptom report in a jail telepsychiatry clinic**
The effectiveness of a jail telepsychiatry service was **evalu**ated by comparing psychiatrist and inmate report of psychopathology. Sixty-two inmates completed a total of 107 consultations at a **rural** county jail via interactive televideo. The inmates completed the Symptom Rating Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R), and the psychiatrist completed a Psychiatr**ist E**valuation Form including the Clinical Global Impression Scale-Severity Index (CGI) after each **teleconsult**ation. Most inmates were rated mild to moderately ill on the CGI. There was a significant, **high** correlation between telepsych**iatri**st evaluation on the CGI and inmate report of **overal**l symptoms on the SCL-90-R [r(101) = 0.35, p < 0.05]. The findings support the effectiveness of tele**psych**iatric evaluation for the jail population.

1. **Evaluation of a rural telepsychiatry service**
Objective: To **evalu**ate a telepsychiatry clinical service to Wagga Wagga in **rural** New South Wales, comprising a face-to-face **interview** with a psychiatrist followed by a telepsychia**try inter**view with a Sydney-based psychiatrist. Methods: Thirty-one patients were referred to a specialist mood disorder clinic i**n a r**ural setting for consultation and assessment. A retrospect**ive e**valuation was made to determine the acceptance of the teleconferenced psychiatry and face-to-face psychiatry, as well as the **overal**l patient response. Results: Twenty participants comple**ted a**ll evaluation components. Their results indicated a **satisfact**ion level of 95% with the consultation process as a whole, with 80% happy to use telepsychiatry again and 60% preferring telepsychiatry over travelling to a larger centre for face-to-face consultation. The face-to-face component **was satis**factory for 85% of patients while the telepsychiatry compon**ent was s**atisfactory for 72%. Conclusions: Although face-to-face psychiatry was preferred by this sample, the telepsychiatry component was **high**ly rated and preferred over travel to larger centres for face-to-face consultation, by resid**ents **of rural and remote locations. Certain issues are of more concern in telepsychiatry than face-to-face psychiatry, including confidentiality, rapport, explanation and education. eid: 2-s2.0-4744354629
2. **Telehealth service delivery for persons with alcoholism**
Videoconferencing at a bandwidth of 384 kbit/s was used in open sessions for subjects with alcohol use disorders (AUD). Study participants received eight sessions of group therapy over a four-week period from an accredited addictions counsellor. Outcome assessment included self-report measures, a qualitative **interview** and a chart review. Of the 18 subjects who started the study, 14 attended at least four sessions of therapy, completed self-report assessments and the thema**tic inter**view. The participants reported **high** levels of **satisfact**ion with telepsychiatry, found the intervention to** be **highly credible, had good session attendance and attrition comparable to that expected with conventional same-room treatment. In all, 82% of subjects reported that they would recommend the service to a friend or family member. The results demonstrate the feasibility of using videoconferencing for service delivery to adults with AUD, and encourage the future performance of randomized controlled trials. eid: 2-s2.0-31544443531
3. **A referrer and patient evaluation of a telepsychiatry consultation-liaison service in South Australia**
A study was carried out to describe the patient population assessed by a telepsychiatry consultation-liaison service in **rural** South Australia, and to assess the referrers' and patients' **satisfact**ion rating with this service. The study was performed in two parts, with retrospective and prospective components. The author completed a semi-structured **interview** for each patient (n=75) with a Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) for the prospective group (n=32). A questionnaire was also sent to all referrers seeking an **evalu**ation of the usefulness of the telepsychia**try inter**view in terms of assessment and management recommendations and outcome. Patients from the prospective group were sent a questionnaire examining th**eir e**valuation of the usefulness** of the i**nterview in terms of assessment and management recommendations, and difficulties with the technology. The patient population was characterized by **high** rates of affective disorder and personality disorder, **and **high indices of developmental disturbance. Referrers r**epor**ted high rates** of satis**faction with the service. Nursing staff rated the service more positively than general practitioners. The usefulness for assessment was** rat**ed more highly than for management. eid: 2-s2.0-0030632517
4. **Does the Use of Telemental Health Alter the Treatment Experience? Inmates' Perceptions of Telemental Health Versus Face-to-Face Treatment Modalities**
In corrections, where staffing limitations tax an overburdened mental health system, telemental health is an increasingly common mode of **mental health servic**e delivery. Although telemental health presents an efficient treatment modality for a spectrum** of mental health se**rvices, it is imperative to study how this modality influences key elements of the treatment experience. In this study, the authors compared inmates' perceptions of the working alliance, postsession mood, and **satisfact**ion with psychiatric and psycho**logical mental healt**h services delivered through 2 different modalities: telemental health and face-to-face. Participants consisted of 186 inmates w**ho received mental h**ealth services (36 via telepsychology, 50 via face-to-face psychology, 50 via telepsychiatry, and 50 via face-to-face psychiatry). Results indicate no significant differences in inmates' perceptions of the work alliance with the mental health professional, postsession mood, or over**all satis**faction with services when telemental health and face-to-face modalities were compared with**in each type of ment**al health service.

0. **Telepsychiatry for stable Chinese psychiatric out-patients in custody in Hong Kong: A case-control pilot study**
Introduction: In Hong Kong, persons in custody receive primary medical care within the institutions of the Correctional Services Department (CSD). However, for psychiatric care, persons in custody must attend specialist out-patient clinics (SOPCs), which may cause embarrassment and stigmatisation. The aim of this interventional pilot study was to compare **teleconsult**ations with face-to-face consultations for a group of stable Chinese psychiatric out-patients in custody. Methods: A total of 86 stable Chinese male out-patients in custody were recruited for psychiat**ric telecon**sultations. They were compared with 249 age-matched Chinese male out-patients in custody attending standard face-to-face psychiatric consultations at other SOPCs. The two groups had comparable baseline characteristics including age, education level, and 12-item Chinese General Health Questionnaire (C-GHQ-12) score. A **satisfact**ion survey of patients towa**rds the tel**econsultation was also carried out. Results: Compared with the face-to-face consultation** group, the** teleconsultation group showed a significantly better result in the difference in C-GHQ-12 scores before and after consultations (P=0.023). The correlation between the f**irst and se**cond teleconsultations also showed a moderate positive relationship (r=0.309). **The satis**faction survey showed a fav**ourable res**ponse to teleconsultations. No significant adverse events **were identi**fied for the teleconsultation group. Conclusion**s: The resu**lts suggest that teleconsultations are a sustainable and safe alternative to face-to-face consultations for stable Chinese psychiatric out-patients in custody. 2018 Hong Kong Academy of Medicine. eid: 2-s2.0-85051778746
1. **Home-based outpatient telepsychiatry to improve adherence with treatment appointments: A pilot study**
Objective: This study examined whether patients who had been nonadherent with **outpati**ent appointments and who were randomly assigned to receive treatment through a telepsychiatry intervention (home-based **video** teleconferencing) would show improvement in adherence to appointments, compared with a treatment-As-usual group. Methods: Participants (N=22) were randomly assigned to home-ba**sed v**ideo teleconferencing or** to out**patient treatment as usual during a six-month study. The primary **outcom**e measure was improvement in visit adherence, which was analyzed using a two-sample t test. Results: Percentage improvement in visit adherence did not differ significantly between the telepsychiatry and treatmentas- usual groups (14%, compared with 15%). A greater number of participants in the telepsychiatry group reported less subjective difficulty in keeping appointments. Conclusions: A small number of participants, short study period, selection bias, and the Hawthorne effect may have limited measured impact in this study. The findings implied that visit nonadherence among frequently nonadherent individuals is largely unrelated to inconvenience. eid: 2-s2.0-85021819602
2. **The North Lewisham Telepsychiatry Project: Beyond the Pilot Phase**
The integration of a telepsychiatry application into an inner-city community mental health service was evaluated over 10 months. ISDN ****video**conferenc**ing at 128 kbit/s was employed for psychiatric consultation between a primary care centre and a community mental health centre. A convenience sample of patients and referrals seen**** by v**ideoconfe**rencing was compared with a sample seen **face to fac**e. During the study period 19 patients were man****aged **by videoc**onferencing and** 12 face to** face. There were 162 consultations, comprising 81 prearranged **teleconsult**ations and 81 prearranged face-to-face consultations. There was no significant difference in attenda**nce between vi**deoconferencing and face-to-face consultatio**ns. Ni**ne of** th**e videoconferencing new referrals had not completed their treatment at the end of the study period, compared with only three in the face-to-face group. This implies that it takes longer to complete treatment for new r**eferra**ls ma**nag**ed by videoconferencing.  2002, SAGE Publications. All rights reserved. eid: 2-s2.0-18144452475
3. **Accuracy of telepsychiatric assessment of new routine outpatient referrals**
Background: Studies on the feasibility of telepsychiatry tend to concentrate only on a subset of clinical parameters. In contrast, this study utilises data from a comprehensive assessment. The main objective of this study is to compare the accuracy of findings from telepsychiatry with those from **face to fac**e interviews. Method: This is a primary, cross-sectional, single-cluster, balanced crossover, blind study involving new routine psychiatric referrals. Thirty-seven out of forty cases fulfilling the selection criteria went through a complete set of independ**ent face to** face and **video** assessments by the researchers who were blind to each other's findings. Results: The accuracy ratio of the pooled results for DSM-IV diagnoses, risk assessment, non-drug and drug interventions were all above 0.76, and the combined overall accuracy ratio was 0.81. There were substantial intermethod agreements for Cohen's kappa on all the major components of evaluation except on the Risk Assessment Scale where there was only weak agreement. Conclusion: Telepsychiatric assessment is a dependable method of assessment with a high degree of accuracy and substantial overall intermethod agreement when compared with s**tandard fac**e to face interview for new routine **outpati**ent psychiatric referrals.  2007 Singh et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd. eid: 2-s2.0-38149015474
4. **An incremental cost analysis of telehealth in Nova Scotia from a societal perspective**
We examined the costs of telehealth in Nova Scotia from a societal perspective. The clinical **outcom**es of telepsychiatry and teledermatology services were assumed to be similar to those for conventional face-to-face consultations. Cost information was obtained from the Nova Scotia Department of Health, the Canadian Institute for Health Information, and questionnaires to patients, physicians and telehealth coordinators. There were 215 questionnaires completed by patients, 135 by specialist physicians and eight by telehealth coordinators. Patient costs for a face-to-face consultation ranged from $240 to $1048 (all costs in Canadian dollars), whereas patient costs for telehealth were lower, from $17 to $70. However, from a societal perspective, the overall cost of providing face-to-face services was lower than for telehealth: the total costs for face-to-face services ranged from $325 to $1133, while the total costs for telehealth services ranged from $1736 to $28,084. A threshold analysis showed that, above a certain patient workload, telehealth services would be more cost-effective than face-to-face services from a societal perspective. This workload is attainable in Nova Scotia. eid: 2-s2.0-15944418935
5. **The effectiveness of telepsychiatry measured using the Health of the Nation Outcome Scale and the Mental Health Inventory**
In a telepsychiatry project in rural Queensland, data were collected from 124 patients attending hospital and general practice facilities for mental health-care and then again at follow-up one year later. Thirty-two of the patients were dealt with using telepsychiatry. Two health status scales were used to measure effectiveness: the Health of the Nation **Outcom**e Scale (HoNOS), administered by the practitioners; and the Mental Health Inventory (MHI), which was self-administered by the patients. There was a significant difference between the initial assessment and follow-up groups on most subscales of the HoNOS, but no significant difference between the face-to-face and telepsychiatry groups. Similarly, the MHI results showed a significant difference on all subscales between the initial assessment and follow-up groups, but no significant difference between the face-to-face and telepsychiatry groups. Individuals who used and did not use telepsychiatry all had improved hea**lth ou**tcome scores on the HoNOS and MHI during the study period. Telepsychiatry was as effective as face-to-face care. eid: 2-s2.0-0037264574
6. **Cost effectiveness, safety, and satisfaction with video telepsychiatry versus face-to-face care in ambulatory settings**
****Video**conferenc**e telepsychiatry provides an alternative for the psychiatric treatment of mental health patients who reside in remote communities. The objective of this study was to compare institutional ambulatory and hospitalization costs, treatment adherence, patient and physician **satisfact**ion, and treatment safety between mental healthcare ****via v**ideoconfe**rencing and care provided in person. Data collected for 1 year of telepsychiatry treatment was compared to that of the preceding year and a matched comparison group. Twenty-nine patients from Or Akiva and 20 patients from Reut Hostel in Hadera who met the inclusion criteria agreed to participate; 24 and 15 patients, respectively, completed the study. Forty-two matched patients, who continued face-to-face interviews, comprised the comparison group. Drop-out patients and those who did not consent to telepsychiatry treatment were not involved. During the year of telepsychiatry treatment, patients and physicians were satisfied and treatment was safe. However, 1 hour of telepsychiatry treatment was more expensive than face-to-face care, and a tendency of increased hospitalizations was noted. Adherence ratios before and during telepsychiatry treatment were similar, but were twice as high versus the comparison group. The limited sample size precludes the drawing of definite conclusions, and further studies involving a larger study population and longer duration of investigation is warranted.

7. **Is telepsychiatry equivalent to face-to-face psychiatry? Results from a randomized controlled equivalence trial**
Objective: The use of interactive ****video**conferenc**ing to provide psychiatric services to geographically remote regions, often referred to as telepsychiatry, has gained wide acceptance. However, it is not known whether clinical **outcom**es of telepsychiatry are as good as those achieved through face-to-face contact. This study compared a variety of clini**cal ou**tcomes after psychiatric consultation and, where needed, brief follow-up for **outpati**ents referred to a psychiatric clinic in Canada who were randomly assigned to be examined **face to fac**e or by telepsychiatry. Methods: A total of 495 patients in Ontario, Canada, referred by their family physician for psychiatric consultation were randomly assigned to be exami**ned face to** face (N=254) or by telepsychiatry (N=241). The treating psychiatrists had the option of providing monthly follow-up appointments for up to four months. The study tested the equivalence of the two forms of service delivery on a var**iety o**f outcome measures. Results: Psychiatric consultation and follow-up delivered by telepsychiatry produc**ed cli**nical outcomes that were equivalent to those achieved when the service was p**rovided fac**e to face. Patients in the two groups expressed similar levels of **satisfact**ion with service. An analysis limited to the cost of providing the clinical service indicated that telepsychiatry was at least 10% less expensive per patient than servi**ce provided** face to face. Conclusions: Psychiatric consultation and short-term follow-up can be as effective when delivered by telepsychiatry a**s when prov**ided face to face. These findings do not necessarily mean that other types of mental health services, for example, various types of psychotherapy, are as effective when provided by telepsychiatry. eid: 2-s2.0-34250894450
8. **Evaluating the diagnostic agreement between telepsychiatry assessment and face-to-face visit: A preliminary study**
Objective: Despite accumulated evidence that demonstrates clinical **outcom**e of telepsychiatry is comparable with conventional method; little research has been done on telepsychiatry in developing countries. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic agreement between telepsychiatry assessment and face-to-face assessment. Moreover, patient and doctor **satisfact**ion was assessed by self-report questionnaire. Method: This study was conducted in an inpatient department of a university-affiliated hospital in Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Iran. The study sample consisted of 40 inpatients aged over 18 years who were selected from October 2016 to February 2017. All patients were visited once by face-to-face conventional method and once by interactive **video** **teleconsult**ation by 2 psychiatric consultants. Results: Results of this study revealed that the diagnostic agreement between the 2 interviewers was 75%. Moreover, about 85% of the patients preferred telepsychiatry for follow-up visits. Also, more than 82% of the patients would recommend telepsychiatry to others although 95% of them perceived contact via telepsychiatry as uncomfortable to some extent. Conclusion: Telepsychiatry service can be used for psychiatric evaluation in Iran, and it has a desirable effect on patient and doc**tor satis**faction. The results of this study showed the capacity of moving towards using telepsychiatry.  2020 Korean Cancer Association. All rights reserved. eid: 2-s2.0-85083399092

The use of telepsychology, such as videoconferencing (VC) systems, has been rapidly increasing as a tool for the provision of mental health services to underserved clients in difficult to access settings. Inmates detained in restrictive housing appear to be at an increased risk of experiencing emotional and behavioral disturbances compared to their **gener**al population counterparts, yet they are less likely to receive appropriate treatment due to security constraints. The primary purpose of this article is to describe the process of implementing a novel telepsychology intervention **specif**ically **design**ed to offer group therapy to high-security, administratively segregated inmates. In addition, preliminary results on treatment and therapeutic process outcomes in a sample of 49 participants are reported. Although some evidence indicated that telepsychology was less preferred than in-person sessions, group differences on measures of psychological functioning and criminal thinking were not found across 3 conditions (telepsychology, in-person, and a no-treatment control). Furthermore, a number of limitations associated with program implementation and st**udy de**sign suggest that results be interpreted with caution and should not be used to discount the use of telepsychology as a viable treatment delivery option. Recommendations for future **develop**ment and **evalu**ation of telepsychological programs are discussed within the context of correctional settings and beyond.

1. **A standard telemental health evaluation model: The time is now**
The telehealth field has advanced historic promises to improve access, cost, and quality of care. However, the extent to which it is delivering on its promises is unclear as the scientific evidence needed to justify success is still emerging. Many have identified the need to advance the scientific knowledge base to better quantify success. One method for advancing that knowledge base is a standard telemental health **evalu**ation model. Telemental health is defined here as the provision of mental health services using live, interactive video-teleconferencing technolo**gy. E**valuation in the telemental health field largely consists of descriptive and small pilot studies, is often defined by the **individu**al goals of the **specif**ic programs, and is typically focused on only one outcome. The field should ad**opt n**ew evaluation methods that consider the co-adaptive interaction between users (patients and providers), healthcare costs and savings, and the rapid evolution in communication technologies. Acceptance of** a st**andard evaluation model will improve perceptions of telemental health as an established field, promote **develop**ment of a sounder empirical base, promote interagency collaboration, and provide a **framework** for more multidisciplinary research that integrates measuring the impact of the technology and the overall healthcare aspect. We suggest that consideration of a standard model is timely given where telemental health is at in terms of its stage of scientific progress. We will broadly recommend some elements of what **such **a standard evaluation model might include for telemental health and suggest a way forward for adopting such a model.

2. **Designing a framework for the evaluation of paediatric telepsychiatry: A participatory approach**
While there is a great deal of interest in **evalu**ating participants' experiences of teleconsultation programmes, **specif**ic **framework**s for s**uch e**valuations are scarce. We have conducted a multi-stage consultation to develo**p a frame**work for the study of a paediatric telepsychiatry programme. Emphasis was placed on ensuring the participation of stakeholders in the **design** and response stage** of t**he evaluation. A three-part **approach** was taken that comprised an opinion scan, focus groups and **individu**al interviews. This resulted in the identification** of sp**ecific areas of enqu**iry f**or the evaluation. One of the key points to emerge was that attending to context is vital. In the case of telepsychiatry, it is critical to understand the nuances of the local community for whom consultations are being provided. This involves considering the 'social e**colog**y' of each e**valua**tion site. The evaluation should take the form of** a di**alogue between the** eval**uators and those being evaluated, in order to maximize the uptake and integration of its findin**gs. The f**ramework we have **develop**ed should be viewed as a guide that is **gener**al enough to be used in **the de**sign of many different types of telepsychiatry programme. eid: 2-s2.0-3142550831
3. **Signal delay effects on rapport in telepsychiatry**
Video-mediated communication research has shown that **telecommun**ication signal delay can cause difficulty in interpersonal coordination of conversation. Studies of rapport suggest that interpersonal coordination is an important aspect of rapport. This study investigated the effect of signal delay on the level of rapport in quasi-psychotherapy sessions (stress **evalu**ation). Video conference counseling sessions were conducted with three levels of signal delay, zero, 300 ms, and 1,000 ms. These were compared to face-to-face counseling sessions. Three male counselors conducted the sessions. Forty-eight client participants, primarily male and female college students, were enrolled in the str**ess e**valuations. The level of client perceived rapport was measured using a self-report instrument administered following the session. The results did not provide evidence for an effect on rapport from delay when considering males and females together. However, males and females were found to respond differently regarding rapport. While no significant differences in rapport were found for males, females scored lower for rapport in the face-to-face condition than in the zero delay and the 300 ms delay condition. These differences may be attributed to the medium rather than to signal delay. Females may have felt more comfortable with unfamiliar male counselors in the video conferences because of the isolation provided, an effect that may have therapeutic application. eid: 2-s2.0-0034002612
4. **An assessment framework for telemedicine applications**
Pressures for the adoption of telemedicine place increased demands on purchasers to assess applications of the technique. Assessment principles are helpful in defining an **evalu**ation **framework** for use at the local level. We suggest an assessment **approach** that includes five **specif**ic elemen**ts: sp**ecification; performance measures; outcomes; summary measures; and operational and other considerations. **The appr**oach described here was **develop**ed to assist with the needs of **individu**al health authorities and institutions within the health-care system of Alberta. Aspects** of the **approach are illustrated using a telepsychiatry example under the assumptions made. Conventional psychiatry (where the patient visited the psychiatrist) was most expensive for the patient. The alternatives, telepsychiatry and outreach psychiatry (where the psychiatrist travelled to the patient), cost about the same from the service provider's perspective (and from that of society as a whole); they were both much cheaper for the patient. At higher volumes, telepsychiatry would be cheaper than outreach. eid: 2-s2.0-0033253290
5. **'CHEATS': A generic information communication technology (ICT) evaluation framework**
This paper describes a **gener**ic **framework** for the **evalu**ation of information communication technologies. T**his frame**work, CHEATS, utilises both qualitative and quantitative research methods and has proved appropriate in multiple clinical settings including telepsychiatry, teledermatology and teleeducation. The paper demonstrates how a multidisciplinary **approach** is essential w**hen e**valuating new and emerging technologies, particularly when such systems are implemented in real service as opposed to a research setting.  2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

6. **Towards a Framework for Evaluating Mobile Mental Health Apps**
Introduction: Mobile phones are ubiquitous in society and owned by a majority of psychiatric patients, including those with severe mental illness. Their versatility as a platform can extend mental health services in the areas of communication, self-monitoring, self-management, diagnosis, and treatment. However, the efficacy and reliability of publicly available applications (apps) have yet to be demonstrated. Numerous articles have noted the need for rigorous **evalu**ation of the efficacy and clinical utility of smartphone apps, which are largely unregulated. Professional clinical organizations do not provide guidelines **for e**valuating mobile apps. Materials and Methods: Guidelines and **framework**s are ne**eded **to evaluate medical apps. Numerous fra**mewor**ks and evaluation criteria exist from the engineering and informatics literature, as well as interdisciplinary organizations in similar fields such as telemedicine and healthcare informatics. Results: We propose criteria for both patients and providers to use in assessing not just smartphone apps, but also wearable devices and smartwatch apps for mental heal**th. A**pps can be evaluated by their usefulness, usability, and integration and infrastructure. Apps can be categorized by their usability in one or more stages of a mental health provider's workflow. Conclusions: Ultimately, leadership is needed to develo**p a frame**work for describing apps, and guidelines are needed for both patients and mental health providers.

0. **Characteristics of patients seen by visiting psychiatrists through Medicare in a rural community mental health service with an established telemedicine service**
Objective: We aimed to **determin**e characteristics of patients receiving **Medicar**e-funded face-to-face consultations by psychiatrists in a **rural** service with an established telemedicine service. Methods: For this study, 55 case-managed patients from f**our r**ural community mental health teams in South Australia provided information through questionnaires regarding psychological symptoms, quality of life, body mass index (BMI) and gave access to th**eir Med**icare data. Results: In a logistic regression, it was found that being younger was more likely associated** with a** Medicare psychiatric consultation (p<0.05). Participants with at least one recorded** visit **to a Medicare psychiatrist consultation also tended to have lower levels of psychological distress at the end of the 4-year period, have a higher BMI, and more general practitioner consultations. Conclusion: The study provides clinicians and policy makers with preliminary information on the subtle differences in clinical profile of p**atients** seen by Medicare-funded psychiatrists within an established state-managed telepsychiatry service.

1. **Geriatric Telepsychiatry: Systematic Review and Policy Considerations**
Telemental health (TMH) for older patients has the potential to increase access to geriatric specialists, reduce travel times for patients and providers, and reduce ever growing healthcare costs. This systematic review article examines the literature regarding psychiatric assessment and treatment via telemedicine for geriatric patients. English language literature was searched using Ovid Medline, PubMed, and PsycINFO with search terms including telemedicine, telemental health, aging, and dementia. Abstracts were reviewed for relevance based on inclusion criteria. Multiple study types were reviewed, including open label, qualitative and randomized controlled trial study designs. Data was compiled regarding participants, study intervention, and outcomes. 76 articles were included. TMH was shown to be feasible and well accepted in the areas of inpatient and nursing home consultation, cognitive testing, dementia diagnosis and treatment, depression in integrated and collaborative care models, and psychotherapy. There is limited data on cost-effectiveness of TMH in the elderly. This article will discuss the current barriers to broader implementation of telemedicine for geriatric patients including reimbursement from the **Medicar**e progr**am. Med**icare reimbursement for telemedicine is limited to **rural** areas, which does not allow for the widespread development of telemedicine progra**ms. All** Medicare beneficiaries would benefit from increased access to telemedicine services, not only those living** in r**ural areas. As many elderly and disabled individuals have mobility problems, home-based telemedicine services should also be made available. There are efforts in Congress to expand the **coverag**e of these ser**vices u**nder Medicare, but strong advocacy will be needed to ensure these efforts are successful.  2018 eid: 2-s2.0-85056225259
2. **Developing Telemental Health Partnerships Between State Medical Schools and Federally Qualified Health Centers: Navigating the Regulatory Landscape and Policy Recommendations**
Background: Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) deliver care to 26 million Americans living in underserved areas, but few offer telemental health (TMH) services. The social missions of FQHCs and publicly funded state medical schools create a compelling argument for the development of TMH partnerships. In this paper, we share our experience and recommendations from launching TMH partnerships between 12 **rural** FQHCs and 3 state medical schools. Experience: There was consensus that medical school TMH providers should practice as part of the FQHC team to promote integration, enhance quality and safety, and ensure financial sustainability. For TMH providers to practice and bill as FQHC providers, the following issues must be addressed: (1) credentialing and privileging the TMH providers at the FQHC, (2) expanding FQHC Scope of Project to include telepsychiatry, (3) remote access to medical records, (4) insurance credentialing/paneling, billing, and supplemental payments, (5) contracting with the medical school, and (6) indemnity **coverag**e for TMH. Recommendations: We make recommendations to both state medical schools and FQHCs about how to overcome existing barriers to TMH partnerships. We also make recommendations about changes to policy that would mitigate the impact of these barriers. Specifically, we make recommendations to the Centers for **Medicar**e and **Medicaid** about insurance credentialing, facility fees, eligibility of TMH encounters for supplemental payments, **and Med**icare eligibility rules for TMH billing by FQHCs. We also make recommendations to the Health Resources and Services Administration about restrictions on adding telepsychiatry to the FQHCs Scope of Project and the eligibility of TMH providers for indemn**ity cov**erage under the Federal Tort Claims Act.  2018 The Authors.

3. **Acceptability of telepsychiatry to a rural population**
Sixty-seven residents of a **rural** Midwestern state were surveyed by telephone to **determin**e which factors influence their willingness to receive **mental health servic**es through live, two-way audio and video transmission. Two-thirds of the survey respondents were willing to participate in telepsychiatry. Many expressed reluctance, however. They were concerned about maintaining confidentiality, and they perceived telepsychiatry as impersonal. **Medicar**e enrollees and older survey respondents were less willing than younger respondents to endorse the use of telemedicine. eid: 2-s2.0-0034117365
4. **Technology Tools: Increasing Our Reach in National Surveillance of Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities**
Challenges in collecting comprehensive health surveillance data on people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) are numerous. A number of important issues and strategies are discussed in the articles contained in this special issue of Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities. In this article, we focus on the advances and tools available in the area of technology. We explore a number of possible sources including accessing big data such as analyzing health information contained in **Medicaid** and **Medicar**e health databases. We also discuss some of the possibilities afforded to us by complementing Medic**aid/Med**icare database information with health information available in the myriad of electronic health records. Lastly, we explore other technologies available that might yield valuable health supports and information, including wearable devices, remote supports and other smart home technologies, telehealth and telepsychiatry, as well as looking at ways to access other technologies that collect health information (e.g., glucometer, health apps, connected exercise devices, etc.). eid: 2-s2.0-85072759544

0. **Telepsychiatry: an Innovative Approach to Addressing the Opioid Crisis**
The opioid epidemic faced by the USA is a complex public health **crisi**s, with staggering loss of life and overwhelming social, health, and economic costs. Despite the rising **need** for medication-assisted treatment, individuals struggling with opioid use continue to face multiple barriers hindering their access to care, particularly in rural areas. Innovative **approach**es to enhance access to treatment **are **needed. Telepsychiatry has proven to be effective and economical across multiple settings and psychiatric diagnoses, including opioid use disorder. As the implementation of telepsychiatry continues to expand, this method of healthcare delivery offers significant opportunities to overcome several barriers to access patients with opioid use disorder face. While addressing the opi**oid c**risis will **requir**e multifaceted efforts involving multiple stakeholders and differ**ent appr**oaches, a comprehensive strategy must incorporate the **adopt**ion of telepsychiatry as an inn**ovative **approach to overcoming barriers to treatment and enhancing access to care.  2018, National Council for Behavioral Health. eid: 2-s2.0-85044513376
1. **AiRCare: A Naturalistic Evaluation of the Effectiveness of a Protracted Telephone-Based Recovery Assistance Program on Continuing Care Outcomes**
Background & Objective Substance use disorder treatments are increasingly being contextualized within a disease management framework. Within this context, there is an identified **need** to maintain patients in treatment for longer periods of time in order to help them learn how to manage their disease. One way to meet t**his **need is through **telephon**e-based interventions that engage patients, and include more active outreach attempts and involvement of the patient's family. This study sought to **evalu**ate the effectiveness of three formats of an intensive 12-month post-discha**rge tele**phone-based **case** management **approach** (AiRCare) on adherence to continuing care plans and substance use outcomes. Methods Data were abstracted from electronic medical records for 379 patients (59.9% male) discharged from a residential treatment program located in the southwestern U.S. from 2013 to 2015. Patients were categorized into one of three groups and r**eceived **telephone contacts based on their self-selection upon admission to residential treatment (i.e., patient only, family only, and both patient and family). Outcome variables included re-engagement and re-admission rates, quality of life, abstinence rates at 6 and 12 months, and compliance with continuing care plans. Results & Conclusions Favorable short- and long-term outcomes were found for the majority of patients, irrespective** of **case management group. There appeared to be some value in the addition of family contacts to patient contacts with respect to reducing risk for 12-month re-admission to residential care. These positive but preliminary indications of the effectiveness of AiRCare **requir**e replication in a well-powered, randomized controlled trial.  2016 Elsevier Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-84993969530
2. **The case of telepsychiatry adoption and diffusion in a healthcare organization in New Zealand**
This research investigated telemedicine **adopt**ion and usage in psychiatry in one hospital in New Zealand (NZ). This research utilized the technological innovations theories as a guiding theoretical framework to develop a set of determinants of telemedic**ine a**doption in healthcare organizations. The research looked at two **stage**s in the **case** study concern**ing t**he adoption process of telemedicine, utilizing the video conferencing technology (TMVC). Pr**ior t**o TMVC adoption, the findings suggeste**d tha**t TMVC was adopted according to its relative advantage and cost effectiveness, along with other facilitating factors such as image enhancement. None of the deterringfactors s**eemed** to impede the adoption decision of TMVC**. Res**ults from the post-adopt**ion s**tage suggested that TMVC was used minimally in **the **case study. The superficial assessment of important factors such as complexity and c**ompat**ibility, prior to TMVC adoption, further suggested this weakness. In comparison with the literature, the incompatibility of TMVC in psychiatry stood as a unique cultura**l ide**ntifier pertaining to TMVC adoption in** the** NZ case study.

5. **Using tailored telephone counseling to accelerate the adoption of colorectal cancer screening**
Background: Few interventions to increase colorectal cancer screening have used a **stage** of change model to promote screening **adopt**ion. None have used computer-assisted tailored **telephon**e counseling calls. This study's purpose was to implement and **evalu****ate s**tage-based computer-assisted tailo**red tele**phone counseling to promote colorectal cancer screening in a primary care **popul**ation. Methods: This randomized controlled trial used a two-stepped intervention that included a mailed booklet on colorectal cancer screening followed by computer-a**ssisted **telephone counseling that was based on the Precaut**ion A**doption Process Model. Chart audit was used to document completion of colonoscopy, sigmoidoscopy or fecal occult blood testing. Results: Record audits were completed on 2474 (88%) of the 2817 eligible participants. There was no significant difference in the frequency and nature of the screening tests completed in the study arms. In a sub-analysis, st**ages **of adoption w**ere e**valuated pr**e- and p**ost-telephone counseling. Over half those receiving counseling reported a ch**ange **in stage toward**s scr**eening adoption. Conclusion: Overall, the intervention did not increase colorectal screening compared to control. Two possible reasons for the absence of a screening effect include: (a) the focus of the protocol on education for most patients rather than motivation, and (b) the **requir**ement that patients interested in screening seek further information and a referral on their own from their providers. While **those re**ceiving telephone counseling improve**d** t**hei**r stage of adoption, we cannot rule out selection bias. Stronger physician recommendation to speak with the counselors could improve call acceptance. Future colorectal screening should address these weaknesses.  2007. eid: 2-s2.0-34547830870
6. **Which helper behaviors and intervention styles are related to better short-term outcomes in telephone crisis intervention? Results from a silent monitoring study of calls to the U.S. 1-800-SUICIDE network**
A total of 2,611 calls to 14 helplines were monitored to observe helper behaviors and caller characteristics and changes during the calls. The relationship between intervention characteristics and call outcomes are reported for 1,431 **crisi**s calls. Empathy and respect, as well as factor-analytically derived scales of supportive **approach** and good contact and collaborative problem solving were significantly related to positive outcomes, but not active listening. We recommend recruitment of helpers with these characteristics, development of standardized training in those methods that are empirically shown to be effective, and the **need** for research relating short-term outcomes to long-term effects.  2007 The American Association of Suicidology. eid: 2-s2.0-34250882070

0. **The application of qualitative approaches to the evaluation of telehealth systems in Australia**
Health Technology Assessment (HTA) of telehealth applications is necessary to assist policy making and reimbursement strategies. A number of authors have concluded that because of the complexities of health, both **qualit**ative and quantitative data are required to resolve questions about the appropriate use of diffuse technologies such as telehealth. Both telepsychiatry and **teleradiolog**y are already covered for reimbursement in Australia. However, the majority of telehealth applications are not suitable for assessment using traditional HTA quantitative methodology. Assessment of telehealth applications should be based more** on qu**alitative methods involving surveys of the experience of practitioners and patients, rather than relying solely on traditional quantitative methods. eid: 2-s2.0-52749092776
1. **Challenges in telemedicine and eHealth: lessons learned from 20 years with telemedicine in Troms.**
The Norwegian Centre for Telemedicine (NST) has, over the past two decades, contributed to the development and implementation of telemedicine and ehealth services in Norway. From 2002, NST has been a WHO Collaboration Center for telemedicine. In August 1996, Norway became the first country to implement an official telemedicine fee schedule making telemedicine services reimbursable by the national health insurer. Telemedicine is widely used in Northern Norway. Since the late 1980's, the **Univers**ity Hospital of North-Norway has experience in the following areas: **teleradiolog**y, **telepatholog**y, **teledermatolog**y, teleotorhinolaryngology (remote endoscopy), remote gastroscopy, tele-echocardiography, remote transmission of ECGs, telepsychiatry, teleophthalmology, teledialysis, teleemergency medicine, teleoncology, telecare, telegeriatric, teledentistry, maritime telemedicine, referrals and discharge letters, electronic delivery of laboratory results and distant teaching for healthcare personnel and patients. Based on the result achieved, the health authority in North-Norway plans to implement several large-scale telemedicine servic**es: Teleradi**ology (incl. solutions for neurosurgery, orthopedic, different kinds of surgery, nuclear medicine, acute traumatic and oncology), digital communication and integration of patient data, and distant education. In addition, the following services will also be considered for large-scale implementation: teledialysis, prehospital thrombolysis, telepsychiat**ry, teledermat**ology. Last in line for implementation are: pediatric, district medical center (DMS), teleophthalmology and ear-nose-throat (ENT). eid: 2-s2.0-38449120147
2. **Towards learning organisations with telemedicine**
For the post-industrial society, the knowledge and information society, learning is an **import**ant activity. We speak about learning organisations and even a learning society. In healthcare dissemination of knowledge may be a tool for improving patient care. **Work**ing with telemedicine has been proposed to result in learning, but research on this is limited. To investigate learning in telemedicine a study was performed with **qualit**ative interviews of 30 pers**ons **working with telepsychiatry, **teledermatolog**y, a **telepatholog**y frozen-section service, and teleotolaryngology. The results clearly sh**ow t**hat working with telemedicine provides learning. More than 80% of the respondents revealed that they had learnt something new by using telemedicine and had improved their knowledge of their specialty as well as other areas. All GPs said they had learnt something new, as well as nurses, psychologists, other categories of personnel, and even medical specialists. When all within psychiatry report that they have learnt something new the future learning potential of telemedicine looks promising for psychiatry. Two-thirds of the respondents could not tell that the learning made them perform tasks for which they previously needed assistance, but the answers may have been dependent on the type of **tele**medical work and the educational background of the respondents. Two-thirds of the respondents thought that something more could be done** in **telemedical work to promote their own learning, which shows the clear potential for learning by tel**emed**icine. To start working with telemedicine initial instruction seems to be sufficient; a more extensive training programme appears unnecessary. In future with many applications of telemedicine implemented, healthcare organisations may bec**ome im**portant arenas for learning and leaders will have to focus on learning.

3. **Telemedicine and changes in the distribution of tasks between levels of care**
The present investigation, which was part of a larger study, was designed to answer the question Has telemedicine produced changes in the distribution of tasks between the general practitioner and specialist, or between the local hospital and **univers**ity/central hospital?' **Qualit**ative interviews were carried out with 30 persons involved in four telemedicine services in Norway: **teledermatolog**y, tele-otolaryngology, telepsychiatry, and a **telepatholog**y frozen-section service. The results indicated that telemedicine does not produce large changes in the distribution of tasks. The reported effects were largest and most complex for telepsychiatry, followed** by teledermat**ology. Local variations in how telemedicine is practised may explain the variation in the findings between telemedicine applications.  2002, SAGE Publications. All rights reserved. eid: 2-s2.0-0036361692
4. **Limitations in the routine use of telepsychiatry**
Telepsychiatry is well established in many countries, but there is still little information about its use in routine health care. We reviewed the literature for information on the use of telepsychiatry in mental health services. From 1033 publications identified in the literature search and through references from a separate project, 16 studies or descriptions of the routine use of telepsychiatry serviceswere selected for further review. Eleven of these articles dealt primarily with videoconferencing and fivew ith telephone-based services. Clinical use of videoconferencing in the programmes described by the reviewed papers was modest, with an average of 16 consultations per month. Three of the telephone-based services had large numbers of clients. The papers we reviewed gave limited consideration to the healthcare systems in which telepsychiatry was provided and to the use of conventional mental health services. Telepsychiatry appears to still be a niche technology in many health systems. A lack of champions for the technology and reimbursement problems may contribute to the limited use of this area of telemedicine. eid: 2-s2.0-64549124784
5. **Meeting the need for educational standards in the practice of telemedicine and telehealth.**
The first telemedicine standard to be developed, documented and adopted widely was the radiology standard, which includes technical and image transmission standards as well as requirements and qualifications needed for **teleradiolog**y practice. But many other health professionals engaged either full time or part time in telemedicine and telehealth--for example, telepsychiatry, **telepatholog**y, teletriage and tele-ophthalmology--also need and use special skills and knowledge. At present, they acquire these skills on the job and their skills may not be recognized. There should be performance standards and telepractice guidelines for professionals operating in the fields of telemedicine and telehealth. Furthermore, there is a case for the development and implementation of education and training standards, enabling professionals who practise in the field to obtain suitable skills, knowledge and recognition for telepractice. eid: 2-s2.0-0033657350
6. **Changes in the job situation due to telemedicine**
Little is known either about how telemedicine changes the job situation or about how the **work**ing environment might be improved for those involved in telemedicine. To investigate these issues, **qualit**ative interviews were carried out with 30 people in Nor**way **working with telepsychiatry (12 respondents), **teledermatolog**y (six respondents), a **telepatholog**y frozen-section service (10 respondents) and tele-otolaryngology (two respondents). The median annual number of remote consultations in telepsychiatry was nine,** in teledermat**ology 81 and in **the telepath**ology frozen-section service nine. The positive asp**ects** of working with telemedicine included less travelling, which gave more tim**e fo**r other work, less need to travel in poor weather, new contacts, an increased sense of professional security (because **support** was readily available) and the satisfaction of seeing partners in communication. At its present volume, telemedicine generally **fits** into daily work patterns quite well. Problems do occur, but they can be solved by appropriate organizational measures. Long-term scheduling of telemedical sessions may be **import**ant**. Ma**ny telemedicine workers want to have the equipme**nt i**n their own office. Working with telemedicine can be tiring and those interviewed wanted to limit the number of hours per week. A solution may be to use large clinics, such as **univers**ity cli**nics**, where the telemedical work could be distributed between several specialists.

In telemedicine, cooperation occurs via telecommunication. This represents a new situation for medical cooperation. Whether such cooperation **work**s poorly or well will be **import**ant with an increasing volume of telemedicine. When personnel are involved in external cooperation, as in telemedicine, the question of cooperation within one's own organization also arises. To investigate these matters, **qualit**ative interviews were performed with 30 pers**ons **working in **teledermatolog**y, telepsychiatry, a **telepatholog**y frozen-section service and tele-otolaryngology. The results showed that cooperating by telecommunication** mai**nly worked well. The cooperation may be influenced by factors such as personality, knowing each other personally, preparation and experience. Tele**medi**cal teamwork may be improved by factors like experience** and** education. Working with telemedicine did not reduce the personnel's cooperation within their own organizations, but rather improved it, although this effect was slight and most commonly involved improved knowledge of others. In general, the findings concerning cooperation and telemedicine were positive. eid: 2-s2.0-0035224111
8. **Learning in organizations working with telemedicine**
To investigate learning in telemedicine, **qualit**ative interviews were conducted with 30 people **work**ing with telepsychiatry, **teledermatolog**y, a **telepatholog**y frozen-section service and tele-otolaryngology. More than 80% of the respondents said that they had learnt something new by using telemedicine. Most frequently the participants improved their knowledge of the specialty in which they were involved, but this was not the only way in which they learnt. The learning did not necessarily change behaviour, as two-thirds of the respondents felt that the learning had not permitted them to perform tasks for which they had previously needed assistance (although this varied somewhat with the type of telemedi**cal **work that respondents were engaged in). Two-thirds of respondents thought that something more could be done in tele**medi**cal work to promote their own learning, which shows the clear potential for learning by telemedicine. Learning could be promoted further by extending the use of the technology to other application**s. T**o start working with telemedicine, initial instruction seems to be sufficient - a more extensive training programme appears unnecessary. In future, as many applications of telemedicine are implemented, health-care organizations may become **import**ant arenas for learning and leaders will have to focus on learning. The results of the present study clea**rly **showed that working with telemedicine produces learning. eid: 2-s2.0-0036366717
9. **Realtime telemedicine**
Telemedicine conducted via prerecorded interaction is more convenient than that using realtime interaction. On the other hand, a realtime consultation allows an immediate result to be obtained and there is likely to be a strong educational component for the remote practitioner. The use of the telephone is under-rated in telemedicine. Telephones have been used in outpatient follow-up, mental health, help lines and **support** groups. Telephones (fixed and mobile) have also been used for data transfer (e.g. for transmission of electrocardiograms). Realtime transfer of still images has been used in **telepatholog**y for many years, and more recently for rapid assessment of injuries. Realtime transfer of video images has been widely explored, perhaps most successfully in telepsychiatry. Some realtime telemedicine applications have been taken up with enthusiasm, even if formal evidence of cost-effectiveness may be lacking. **Teleradiolog**y and telepsychiatry are two examples where widespread adoption is beginning to occur. Other forms of realtime telemedicine represent 'niche' applications. That is, they appear to be both successful and sustainable in the centres where they were pioneered, but have not been adopted elsewhere. Teledialysis and teleoncology are examples of this type. The patchy diffusion of telemedicine is something that is not yet well understood. eid: 2-s2.0-37349083897
10. **Prioritisation of telemedicine services for large scale implementation in Norway**
In late 2005, the Northern Norway Regional Health Authority requested an evaluation of all tested telemedicine services in northern Norway to clarify which were suitable for large scale implementation. A total of 282 reports from the Norwegian Centre for Telemedicine, the **Univers**ity Hospital of North Norway and **the Uni**versity of Troms were included in the study. Projects not focusing on secondary health care were excluded and 46 studies representing 21 topics entered the final analysis. They were analysed with a self-developed scoring tool focusing on five items. Eleven topics were concluded as being candidates for large scale implementation and grouped according to priority. The first priority topics were **teleradiolog**y, digital communication/integration of patient records and education. The second priority topics were teledialysis, pre-hospital thrombolysis, telepsychiatry and **teledermatolog**y. The third priority topics were paediatrics, district medical centres, tele-ophthalmology and tele-otorhinolaryngology. No priority was suggested for the projects in cardiology, endocrinology, geriatrics, gynaecology/obstetrics, pathology and nursing/care. User **support**, training, research ability, financial incentives and interaction between clinicians and ICT-personnel were considered as **import**ant factors in motivating healthcare personnel to use telemedicine. eid: 2-s2.0-38449112255
11. **Telepathology networking in VISN-12 of the veterans health administration**
The Veterans Integrated Service Net**work** (VISN)-12, headquartered in Chicago, has implemented a **telepatholog**y** net**work between the eight VISN-12 hospital laboratories and Loyola **Univers**ity Medical School linked by an economical, high-speed wide-**area** network (WAN). Implementation of the WAN has reduced monthly telecommunications costs in VISN-12 by approximately 67%. In addition** to telepath**ology, the WAN enables real-time **teleradiolog**y (general computer tomography, and ultrasound), telefluoroscopy, telenuclear medicine imaging, telepsychiatry, and other forms of teleconsultation. Current applicat**ions of tele**pathology in VISN -12 include: primary diagnosis and consultation in surgical pathology, interpretation of serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation gels, provision of **support** for consolidated microbiology laboratories, review of problematic peripheral blood smears, and distance learning. We have learned a variety of l**essons from **telepathology. The enthusiasm and technical skill of providers are essential for success. As well, frequent communication and rapid techn**ica sup**port are necessary. Finall**y, in a** supporti**ve environme**nt, telepathology is a tool that can help bring together clinical laboratories with shared missions and goals. eid: 2-s2.0-0033664099
12. **Telemedicine in northern Norway**
The **Univers**ity Hospital of Troms has been involved in a variety of telemedicine activities since the late 1980s, including **teleradiolog**y, **telepatholog**y, **teledermatolog**y, remote endoscopy, remote gastroscopy, teleechocardiography, transmission of electrocardiograms, telepsychiatry, electronic delivery of laboratory results and distance learning for health professionals. Since 1993 the department of telemedicine in Troms has been designated the national centre of competence in telemedicine. With a wealth of experience to draw from, a critical number of health-care professionals exposed to and using telemedicine routinely, the **support** of the Norwegian health authorities, a national centre guiding telemedicine research, no licensing barriers within the country, nationwide ISDN and reimbursement for telemedicine services, the future of telemedicine in Norway looks promising. eid: 2-s2.0-0030632352
13. **A qualitative study of the organizational consequences of telemedicine**
The organizational consequences of telemedicine have frequently been mentioned in the telemedicine community, but there are few empirical studies. A study was therefore carried out of what happens in organizations when telemedicine is implemented. **Qualit**ative interviews were undertaken with 30 persons **work**ing in **teledermatolog**y, telepsychiatry, a **telepatholog**y frozen-section service and tele-otolaryngology. Almost all respondents reported numerous organizational changes, some **import**ant. Changes** in **work processes were the most common. Examples of the organizational consequences of telemedicine were organizational restructuring, new organizational units, changed mechanisms for internal coordination, different flows of patients through the health-care system, improved coordination of care, new job descriptions, relocation of the p**lace** of work, employment of personnel living far aw**ay f**rom the workplace, effects on employees not directly involved in telemedicine, sharing of experiences, minor staffing change**s, c**linical teamwork independent of co-location, administrative meetings arranged by telemedicine, merger of organizations independent of location, less travel by staff (and patients), a possible beneficial effect on **the qu**ality of care, and limited opposition to the adoption of the technology. Telemedicine may** be im**portant in the future organization of the disciplines studied and in health-care generally. The infrastructu**re o**f electronic networks may **play a**n important role for organizations as the volume of telemedicine activity increases and economies of scale are realized. eid: 2-s2.0-0035229519
14. **Telemedicine user network: A call for interested participants**
Telemedicine, or the use of telecommunication technologies for the delivery of medical services, has been receiving increasing attention as a possible answer to the tyranny of distance and the scarcity of specialist resources in rural and remote Australia [1,2]. While internationally **teleradiolog**y and **teledermatolog**y are the most frequent users of the technology, in Australia it is psychiatry that has been quick to recognise the potential of telemedicine and to use it for the delivery of specialist psychiatric **support**. In Australia telepsychiatry is one of the most common forms of telemedicine with some of the most established and successful tele-psychiatry programmes in the world.  1997, The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists.

0. **Attitudes Towards Implementation of Store-and-Forward Telemental Health in Humanitarian Settings: Survey of Syrian Healthcare Providers**
Store-and-forward (SandF) telemedicine is thought to be most applicable in humanitarian settings. Unlike other kinds of telemental health (TMH), SandF requires engagement and active **particip**ation from healthcare providers in submitting text or audio-video clinical material for consultations. To implement such consultative systems there is a need to gauge providers' attitudes towards this technology. Materials and Methods: An electronic survey was sent to Syrian healthcare providers (physicians and nonphysicians) who are affiliated with humanitarian nongovernmental organizations managing Syrians affected by war. After a description of what TMH and SandF a**re, part**icipants were asked about their attitudes towards such services. Results: Fifty-two providers responded to the electronic survey. Only results from providers inside Syria (n=30) are presented. The **major**ity of respondents had no **experi**ence with TMH. Half of the providers believed that mental healthcare can be provided through SandF and that there would be a benefit from such services. Respondents reported that **cultur**al (68%), financial (84%), and technical (80%) barriers do exist for such services. When asked, providers believed that patients would agree to be audiotaped (58%) for the purpose of SandF compared with being videotaped (15%) (p=0.007). Conclusions: Electronic surveys of healthcare workers in humanitarian settings are feasible. Providers in the Syrian humanitarian setting have lit**tle ex**perience in TMH; however, they are open to using an SandF service while acknowledg**ing cu**ltural, financial, and technical barriers to the implementation.  2016 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-84954457631
1. **Reactions of psychiatric patients to telepsychiatry**
Telepsychiatry could offer a viable medical service to remote or isolated social communities if it does not generate adverse reactions such as delusional ideation, particularly in patients in settlements without adequate exposure to mainstream **cultur**e and internet. We examined subjective reactions to telepsychiatry of randomly selected 84 psychiatric patients from remote locations in Ontario, Canada. They rated the quality of their teleconferencing sessions via 10 item questionnaire and were asked about advantages and disadvantages of telepsychiatry. The **major**ity of patients indicated that they were able to communicate as if physically present (92.9%) and were **comfort**able with telepsychiatric service (95.2%). They found the sessions as beneficial as direct meetings with their psychiatrist (84.5%) and would use this service again (98.8%). There were no instances of telepsychiatry being associated with adverse reactions in patients from remote communities with inadequate exposure to modern mainstr**eam cu**lture and internet.  R.

2. **Telepsychiatry services for Korean immigrants**
Asian Americans often face **cultur**al and language barriers when obtaining mental health treatment. With the small number of Asian mental health providers, it is difficult to ensure the linguistic and ethnic matching of providers and patients. Telepsychiatry holds great promise to address the unique needs of Asian Americans. We developed a project to establish telepsychiatry services that connect **Korean** mental health patients in Georgia with a linguistically **and cu**lturally competent psychiatrist in California and assessed the level of acceptability of psychiatric treatment via real-time teleconferencing among these patients. Upon the completion of the program, 16 patients (5 men, 11 women) completed a questionnaire that measured their acceptability of the telepsychiatry service. The findings indicate a high level of acceptance of the program am**ong Ko**rean patients. The quantitative and qualitative data show that they especially apprecia**ted th**e cultural sensitivity of the consultation and the **comfort**able interaction with the provider. However, challenges such as technical issues of teleconferencing may negatively affect the quality of the clinical interaction. Our study expands the knowledge base regarding the acceptability of such services to a population that **experi**ences disparities in mental health care. Future research should extend telepsychiatry services to other Asian population groups t**hat ex**perience lower access to mental health services.  2012, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-84871264338
3. **A Survey of Telepsychiatry in the USA**
Active telepsychiatry services in the United States were surveyed. Telepsychiatry was being used in four broad areas: educational, **administr**ative, research, and clinical. Of the five telepsychiatry sites with accurate patient **contact** data, there was a mean of 1.35 pati**ent con**tacts per week. The **major**ity of telepsychiatry usage involved direct physician-**patient** contact. No adverse outcomes to patients were reported.  1995, SAGE Publications.

4. **A description of Telemental Health Services provided by the Veterans Health Administration in 2006-2010**
Objective: This is the first large-scale study to describe the types of telemental health services provided by the Veterans Health **Administr**ation (VHA). Methods: The authors compiled national-level **VHA admin**istrative data for fiscal years 2006-2010 (October 1, 2005, to September 30, 2010). Telemental health encounters were identified by VHA and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs stop codes and categorized as medication management, individual psychotherapy with or without medication management, group psychotherapy, and diagnostic assessment. Results: A total of 342,288 telemental health encounters were identified, and each type increased substantially across the five years. Telepsychotherapy with medication management was the fastest growing type of telemental health service. Conclusions: The use of videoconferencing technology has expanded beyond medication management alone to include telepsychotherapy services, including both individual and group psychotherapy, and diagnostic assessments. The increase in telemental health services is encouraging, given the large number of returning veterans living in rural areas. eid: 2-s2.0-84870015766
5. **Videoconferencing in psychiatry: A survey of use in northern Norway**
A survey of the use of videoconferencing in mental health care was carried out in northern Norway. A questionnaire was distributed to all user institutions in northern Norway at the same time that ISDN became available, in mid-1995. The questionnaire completion rate for locations recorded as **particip**ants in videoconferencing sessions was 62%. Within six months, a total of 1028 persons **had part**icipated in 140 videoconferencing sessions from 35 institutions. The purposes of videoconferencing included meetings (50%), supervision, training and teaching (31%), clinical consultations (14%) and tests or demonstrations (5%). The alternative forms of **contact** which videoconferencing replaced included travel (59%),** no con**tact (25%), telephone (14%), and mail or fax (2%). No problems were reported in 55% of the sessions; in 19% there were audio problems, in 14% there were picture problems, in 5% attempts to connect failed and in 5% disconnection occurred. The **major**ity of users (87%) reported that they were satisfied or very satisfied with the facility; 8% were uncertain and 5% were less satisfied or totally dissatisfied. Continued surveying will provide longitudinal data on the diffusion of telepsychiatry in northern Norway. eid: 2-s2.0-0030322261
6. **Acceptability of telepsychiatry in American Indians**
Telepsychiatry differs from in-person treatment in terms of its delivery mechanism, and this dissimilarity may increase **cultur**al differences between the provider and the patient. Beca**use cu**ltural competence and identification can impact **patient satisfact**ion ratings, we wanted to explore **whethe**r cultural differences in our study population influenced telepsychiatric and in-person interviews. Here, we compared the acceptability of conducting psychiatric assessments with rural American Indian veterans by real-time videoconferencing versus inperson **administr**ation. The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IIIR (SCID) was given to **particip**ants both in person and by telehealth. A process measure was created to ass**ess part**icipants' responses to the interview type concerning the usability of the technology, the perceptions of the interviewee/interviewer inter**action**, the cultural competence of the interview, and satisfaction with the interview and the interview process. The process measure was administered to 53 American Indian Vietnam veterans both in-person and by real-time interactive videoconferencing. Mean responses were compared f**or each **participant. Interviewers were also asked several of the same quest**ions as **the participants; answers were compared to th**e corres**ponding participant responses. Overall, telepsychiatry was well received and comparable in level of patient **comfort**, sa**tisfac**tion, and cultural acceptance to in-person interviews. We also found evidence to suggest that interviewers so**metimes **interpreted participant satisfaction as significantly **less fav**orable than the participants actually responded. Despite the potential of videoconfe**rencin**g to increase cultural differences, we found that it is an acceptable means for psychiatric assessment of American Indian veterans and presents an opportunity to provide mental health services to a population that might otherwise not have access.

7. **Cultural aspects of telepsychiatry**
Telepsychiatry may involve working with clinicians, patients and systems of care that are both geographically and **cultur**ally distinct. In this conte**xt, cu**lturally appropriate care is an important component of telepsychiatry. The outl**ine fo**r cultural formulation from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) provides general principles for addressing these issues. Two components of the outline are particularly relevant in telepsychiatry: **(1) ho**w the cultural background of patie**nts (i**.e. their cultural identity) influences their **comfort** with technology; an**d (2) **the effect of cultural differences on the patient**-provi**der relationship. Cultural differences between patient and provider are often highlighted in telepsychiatry by the patient and provider location (e.g. rural versus urban differences). Familiarity with the rural community and regular **contact** and feedback are important. Future research should examine the effect of telepsychiatry on patient-provider relationships, patient attitudes towards care and, most importantly, patient outcomes. eid: 2-s2.0-33748852573
8. **Telepsychiatry and cultural barrier in Korea**
This research was performed in order to empirically prove that telepsychiatry can result in overcoming of the Confucian **cultur**al barrier which discouraged **Korean** patients from seeking psychiatric care. The Confuc**ian cu**lture of Korea forces its members to observe absolute conformity to the social norm. In this **kind o**f culture it is very hard to admit one's mental illness and to seek medical help. Thus telepsychiatry might be a good alternative to face-to-face meeting-based psychiatry es**pecial**ly in culturally inhibitive places such as Korea. We conducted a telepsychiatry **experi**ment using Instant Messenger with 93 volunteers who had** an ex**perience of seeing a psychiatrist in person. The result shows that people tend to think that telepsychiatry allowed them to break out o**f the **Confucian cultural protocol which put heavy emphasis on avoiding any irregular thought. eid: 2-s2.0-77953016400

0. **Wireless Tech Trends 2010. Trend: telemedicine.**
THE LANDSCAPE: As the U.S. population ages and the **number** of patients with chronic conditions continues to rise, hospitals are beginning to leverage **remot**e technology to improve care post-discharge and cut down on avoidable hospital readmissions. In addition, **rural** areas with increasingly limited access to specialists are using telemedicine to provide care without transporting patients from small, critical care hospitals into the larger cities. THE FUTURE: As healthcare reform begins to change the payment structure, episode of care reimbursement will provide the push for hospitals to increase their chronic care management programs. The cost of technology for in-home monitoring is rapidly dropping, and patients will begin to play a greater role in managing their own care. In addition, Washington's pledge to increase the national network infrastructure means t**hat r**ural areas will have better, faster connections to link specialty services to the cities, and the use of telemedicine for specialty services like telepsychiatry, telestroke and wound care may rise. eid: 2-s2.0-77951644990
1. **A pilot program in rural telepsychiatry for deaf and hard of hearing populations**
Background Access to mental health care in deaf communities is limited by cultural considerations, availability of translators, and technological considerations. Telepsychiatry can mitigate the deaf community's lack of access to care by allowing for deaf individuals in **remot**e communities access to care with facilities that cater to their needs. Methods Community Behavioral Health, Arundel Lodge, and Gallaudet **Univers**ity worked in conjunction to test three hypotheses: Telepsychiatry will be as effective as traditional face-to-face psychotherapy with deaf adults who have chronic mental illness.Patients living** in r**emote locations will report an improvement in accessibility to mental health services.Patients who receive telepsychiatry will report a comparable level of satisfaction of services to those receiving traditional services. The patient sample consisted of 24 participants, 13 women, 11 men. Telepsychiatry sessions were scheduled based on each patient's individual treatment plan against a control group who saw their providers face to face. Results The telepsychiatry and in-person groups were slightly different at baseline. Analysis of the data revealed no significant difference in coping abilities and psychiatric symptoms between those receiving face-to-face psychotherapy and those receiving telepsychiatry. Interpretation The quality and outcome of care was equal to in-person for the telepsychiatry in deaf patients. Since telepsychiatry does not compromise the quality of care, it is a good means of reaching out to members of the deaf community that cannot readily **access mental** health resources that meet their needs.  2016 The Authors.

2. **A telepsychiatry model to support psychiatric outreach in the public sector in South Africa**
The access of **rural** Mental Health Care Users in South Africa to specialist psychiatrists and quality mental health care is **current**ly sub-optimal. Health professionals and planners working in psychiatry lack a well-defined and feasible outreach model to facilitate the delivery of services to **remot**e **and r**ural areas. In response to this **challeng**e, a three-year action research telepsychiatry study was undertaken by the Departments of Psychiatry and TeleHealth at the **Univers**ity of KwaZulu-Natal, to develop a telepsychiatry outreach model based on local research and international evidence. The Model draws on needs and infrastructure assessments of the designated psychiatric hospitals in the province, a review of the published international evidence on telepsychiatry and videoconference-based education, and an evaluation of local clinical and educational telepsychiatry implementations in KwaZulu-Natal. The Model proposed is "virtual", i.e. not bound to provincial or district referral patterns, aims not to add to the burden on **the cur**rent workforce and is intended to be integrated into psychiatry outreach services and policy. The Model should be subjected to in situ testing for validation and implementation. It is hoped that an implementation of this Model will improve the access of Mental Health Care Users to specialist psychiatry care. eid: 2-s2.0-84870978861
3. **Enhancing access to psychologically informed mental health services in rural and northern communities**
Access to psychologically informed mental health services has historically been a **challeng**e for the more than 6 million Canadians residing in **rural** and northern (R&N) communities. However, over the past 20 years, Canada has been witness to a **number** of positive psychologist-led initiatives aimed at enhancing access for R&N Canadians. These can be grouped into 2 main categories, namely recruiting and retaining psychologists in R&N communities and developing and implementing technologically supported psychology services offered at a distance (telepsychology). This article provides an overview of the barriers to accessing psychologically informed mental health services and reviews some of the psychologist-led initiatives aimed at enhancing access in R&N Canada. Potential benefits and limitations of these initiatives are presented and the importance of enhanced collaboration between urban and R&N-based psychologists is discussed. Finally, psychologists are encouraged to look for and embrace opportunities to further broaden and enhance their positive presence in R&N communities.  2013 Canadian Psychological Association. eid: 2-s2.0-84878331449
4. **Counseling center-based tele-mental health for students at a rural university**
Students attending **rural** academic institutions often have no immediate access to psychiatrists to supplement on-site Counseling Center (CC) services. Because the Medical College of Georgia (MCG) could not cost-effectively provide on-site psychiatry services to Georgia Southern **Univers**ity (GSU) students, the two institutions explored telehealth services delivered by supervised Psychiatry residents using Web-based videoconferencing on MCG's virtual private network. GSU counselors completed client severity rating forms. CC clients in ongoing therapy who were judged to be in need of psychiatric services were referred to the Tele-clinic (TC). CC counselors referred the most **challeng**ed students to TC according to total distress score on intake, clinician intake assessment of client difficulty, and client need for medications. After seeing the clients in TC, MCG residents also completed GSU CC client severity rating forms. Post-intake and satisfaction surveys already in use at the GSU CC were completed both by CC clients not in TC and by CC clients jointly enrolled in TC. TC and CC populations were compared by gender, race, past mental health treatment, past psychiatric hospitalization, and past and **current** use of psychotropic drugs. Telepsychiatry conducted using low bandwidth videoconferencing successfully supplemented GSU CC mental healthcare, especially for clients with the most serious problems, and did so without travel from campus and within the milieu of daily student life. Cost-effective telepsychiatry services can successfully supplement management of students with mental health issues who att**end r**ural, smaller, and/or resou**rce-chal**lenged academic institutions.

Reforming mental health care is a focus of many ongoing initiatives in the United States, both at the national and state levels. Access to adequate mental health care services is one of the identified problems. Telepsychiatry and e-mental health services could improve access to mental health care in **rural**, **remot**e and underserved areas.

6. **Evaluating the promise of health IT to enhance/expand the reach of mental health services**
Objective: A growing **number** of health information technologies (HIT) are being developed and tested to address mental health conditions. HIT includes Internet and smartphone programs or apps, text messaging protocols and telepsychiatry. We reviewed the promise and evidence that HIT can expand access to mental health care and reduce disparities in use of services across groups in need. Conclusions: Limited reach of mental health services is a pervasive problem in the United States, and solving it will require innovations that enable us to extend our clinical reach into underserved populations without significantly expanding our workforce. In theory, HIT can extend access to mental health care in several ways: by enhancing the reach to priority populations, addressing system capacity issues, supporting training, improving clinical decision making, lowering the "consumer's threshold" for treatment, delivering preventive mental health services, speeding innovation and adoption and reducing cost barriers to treatment. At present, evidence is limited, and research is needed, focusing on consumer engagement strategies, the benefits and harms of HIT for the therapeutic relationship and the comparative effectiveness of various HIT alternatives.  2013 Elsevier Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-84879461048
7. **Telemedicine and advances in urban and rural healthcare delivery in Africa**
Telecardiology holds great promise for Africa, from tele-echocardiography and tele-ECG s, to home monitoring and text messaging for medication adherence monitoring. The burden of disease is great and there is an extreme shortage of health professionals. Telemedicine can provide access to scarce specialist care, improve the quality of care in **rural** areas and reduce the need **for r**ural patients to travel to seek medical attention. International cross border service can alleviate the shortage of doctors. But telecardiology, and telemedicine uptake in general, has been poor in Africa. Legal and ethical issues around local and cross border telemedicine have not been resolved. The literature was reviewed and obstacles to telemedicine in Africa and **current** telemedicine activities in Africa, are described. There are few sustained telemedicine services in Africa with the exception of tele-education. There is an expectation that mobile phones will facilitate a range of telemedicine activities in Africa. Africa needs telemedicine.  2013 Elsevier Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-84887948228

0. **Telepsychiatry Consultation for Medical and Surgical Inpatient Units**
Background Telepsychiatry is becoming more commonplace in the provision of psychiatric care. Most commonly used in the **outpati**ent setting, there is little information available in the literature as to the use of telepsychiatry for **inpati**ent medical/surgical consultation. Objective We review the **Univers**ity of Pittsburgh Medical **Center**'s telepsychiatry consultation program that provides consultation to an outlying community-based **rural** hospital. Methods This article examines the 69 telepsychiatry consultations that were performed from November 2014 through February 2016, looking at the patients served, common consultation questions, and patterns of diagnoses and recommendations. Results The median age of individuals undergoing telepsychiatry evaluations was 67 years, and the most common reason for consultation was for delirium. Over half of the patients consulted had a primary diagnosis of delirium, dementia, or a cognitive disorder not otherwise specified, using Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition, Text Revision) diagnoses. In most patients, additional laboratory studies or imaging or both were requested and medication changes recommended (initiation, dose changes, and discontinuation). Conclusion This report provides one of the first detailed views of the use of telepsychiatry in a rem**ote in**patient medical setting. Findings will guide education to primary teams and will shape the development of future telepsychiatry interventions.  2018 The Academy of Psychosomatic Medicine. eid: 2-s2.0-85029228744
1. **Telepsychiatry program eases patient crowding in the ED, expedites mental health services to patients and providers.**
With funding from the Duke Endowment, the Albemarle Hospital Foundation in Elizabeth City, NC, implemented a telepsychiatry program aimed at decreasing patient backlogs in the health system's EDs, while also quickly connecting patients with needed mental health care. The approach has more than halved LOS for patients who are discharged to **inpati**ent treatment facilities. The approach is also credited with reducing recidivism rates and the need for involuntary commitments. Now the state has announced plans to employ a similar approach statewide. Patients in the ED are connected with psychiatric providers at a remote location through the use of telemedicine carts that are equipped with wireless technology. With expedited psychiatric treatment, administrators say that nearly 30% of patients with involuntary commitment (IVC) orders stabilize to the point that their IVC orders can be rescinded and they can be discharged from the ED to **outpati**ent care. Since the start of the pilot program in March of 2011, project administrators report that the average LOS in the ED for patients discharged** to in**patient treatment facilities has decreased from 48 hours to 22.5 hours. eid: 2-s2.0-84891597657
2. **Telepsychiatry for Inpatient Consultations at a Separate Campus of an Academic Medical Center**
Background: Many hospitals do not have regular access to psychiatry consult services. This is well understood as a common shortage at nonacademic community hospitals (especially in **rural** environments, and may also be a problem at noncontiguously located smaller hospitals that are affiliated with academic medical **center**s in urban settings. The authors sought to deliver timely **inpati**ent psychiatric consultation-liaison services via telemedicine to a local but physically separated hospital affiliated with an academic medi**cal ce**nter. Materials and Methods: The authors collaborated with an office dedicated to the advancement of telemedicine technology at their academic **medica**l center. They developed a telemedicine-based care model to deli**ver in**patient consultation-liaison psychiatry consultations to an affiliated (but physically separate) small academic hospital that did not have its own on-site consultation-liaison psychiatry team. Results: The authors were able to successfully complete 30 consultations, each within 24 h. Only 1 patient was ultimately unwilling to participate in the telemedicine interview. As consultations were accomplished on same day as request, patient length of stay was unaffected. Conclusions: This pilot study suggests that telemedicine is a viable mo**del fo**r inpatient consultation-liaison psychiatry services to hospitals without on-site psychiatry resources and represents a viable alternative model of service delivery.  2016, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2016. eid: 2-s2.0-84978032635
3. **Expansion of the consultation-liaison psychiatry paradigm at a university medical center: Integration of diversified clinical and funding models**
The perspective of the contemporary Consultation-Liason Service (CLS) psychiatrist is increasingly one of consultant to medical and surgical colleagues in models other than **inpati**ent medical and surgical units. Simultaneously, the need for a clinically and educationally rob**ust in**patient CLS persists despite funding pressures. The **Univers**ity of California, Davis Medical **Center** Department of Psychiatry has made use of creative organizational and financial models to accompl**ish th**e inpatient CLS clinical and educational missions in a fiscally responsible manner. In addition, the department has in recent years expanded the delivery of psychiatry consultation-liaison clinical and educational services to other models of care delivery, broadening the role and influence of the CLS. Several of the initiatives described in this paper parallel an overall evolution of the practice of consultation-liaison psychiatry in response to managed care influences and other systems pressures. This consultation-liaison paradigm expansion with diversified sources of funding support facilitates the development of consultation-liaison psychiatry along additional clinical, administrative, research, and educational dimensions. Ot**her uni**versity medi**cal ce**nters may consider adaptation of some of the initiatives described here to their institutions.  2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. eid: 2-s2.0-0038013578
4. **Telepsychiatry "coverage" to a rural inpatient psychiatric unit**
Objective: **Rural** psychiatrists responsible for **inpati**ent psychiatry units in **gener**al hospitals often have trouble getting coverage for training, vacations, and periods of illness. This article describes telepsychiatry "coverage" t**o a r**u**ral g**eneral hospital psychiatric unit for 1 week. Materials and Methods: All adult patients meeting criteria **for in**patient mental health treatment in the emergency room were offered admission** to t**he general hospital after obtaining informed consent regarding the** use o**f inpatient telepsychiatry. The number of pati**ents o**n the inpatient psychiatric unit ranged from three to nine, with an average daily census of seven. All psychiatric care was provided via video teleconferencing (VTC) at a bandwidth of 512 kilobits per second using Internet Protocol. Results: Patients with psychosis reported more difficulty hearing the doctor than patients without psychosis and incorporated VTC into delusions in a congruent manner. Patients rated development of rapport and effectiveness of treatment higher than staff ratings. Two staff thought telepsychiatry was either not effective for acutely psychotic patients or more effective with higher functioning patients. Conclusions: Short-term co**vera**ge** **of rural inpatient psychiatric units for purposes of vacation, training, and illness is possible using telepsychiatry. Psychiatrist's efficiency and consistency are enhanced with instantaneous connections possible from hospital, office, or home. Significant increases in staff workload will occur without remote access to electronic medical records, electronic physician ordering, and an adequate phy**sical **layout of the inpatient psychiatric unit. Adequate educational preparation of unit staff regarding telepsychiatry and a staff process group during implementation is recommended.

5. **Impact of a telepsychiatry program at emergency departments statewide on the quality, utilization, and costs of mental health services**
Objective: This study estimated the impact of a statewide, centralized telepsychiatry service provided in nonpsychiatric emergency departments (EDs) on use of mental health services. Methods: Individuals treated via telepsychiatry were compared with a matched control group of individuals with mental health diagnoses who were treated in nonparticipating hospitals. Bivariate and two-part and **gener**alized linear regression models were used to assess differences between the two groups in **outpati**ent follow-up, hospital admission following the ED visit, length of hospital stay if admitted, and **inpati**ent and total costs. Results: Between March 2009 and June 2013, there were 9,066 patients with at least one telepsychiatry visit. Of these, 7,261 had index telepsychiatry visits that the authors were able to successfully match. Compared with the matched control group, telepsychiatry recipients were more likely to receive 30-**day out**patient follow-up (46% versus 16%, p<.001) and** 90-day** outpatient follow-up (54% versus 20%, p<.001). Telepsychiatry recipients were less likely than the control group to be admitted to the hospital during the index ED visit (11% versus 22%, p<.00 1). The combined effect of having a telepsychiatry consult during the index ED visit was a reduction of.86 days** in in**patient length of stay. Thi**rty-da**y inpatient costs were $2,336 (p=.04) lower for the telepsychiatry versus the control group, but 30-day total health care costs were not statistically different. Conclusions: Telepsychiatry delivered in the ED through a centralized coordinated program has great promise for improving l**inkage **with outpatient mental health services whi**le red**ucing inpatient utilization and hospital costs. eid: 2-s2.0-84946557675
6. **Designing an academic-community telepsychiatry partnership to provide inpatient and outpatient services in a critical access hospital**
To expand access to mental health treatment in an underserved area, the **Univers**ity of Washington (UW) and Dayton **Gener**al Hospital (DGH) entered into a partnership to provide comprehensive telepsychiatry services to individuals living in **rural** Columbia County. **Outpati**ent care is provided by behavioral health consultants at two DGH-affiliated primary care clinics in consultation with a UW-based psychiatrist with expertise in addictions. **Inpati**ent care is supported by regular consultation with UW psychiatrists as well as unscheduled "curbside" consults with attending UW psychiatrists. Patients with complex treatment options can participate in direct videoconferencing sessions with a UW psychiatrist.  2019 American Psychiatric Association.

1. **Success and failure in a Michigan telepsychiatry programme**
Telemedicine **programm**es are often **complex** undertakings that result in combinations of **success** and failure. Michigan State University and LifeWays received a grant for a four-phase telepsychiatry research **project** in 2000. We employed multiple data-collection techniques, including patient and provider surveys, in-depth interviews, observation, patient chart analyses, and organizational archival data analyses. Of the four phases in **the pro**ject, two proved to** be suc**cessful, one failed in its initial goal but succeeded with a redefined goal, and one failed completely. Issues that a**ffected** success or failure included human resource conflicts, organizational structure, inter-organizational relationships and allocated resources. eid: 2-s2.0-0345238663
2. **The evolution of a successful telemedicine mental health service**
**Develop**ment of telemedicine **mental health servic**es in Alberta evolved via a pilot **project**, the delivery of routine services to a small group of centres and subsequent expansion to a province-wide **programm**e. **Success** of the service was linked to support for telehealth by the provincial **govern**ment and consultation between the Alberta Mental Health Board (AMHB) and local stakeholders. Assessments by the AMHB have shown that telepsychiatry is acceptable and sustainable at a realistic cost. However, there are few measures of clinical effectiveness available and none of cost-effectiveness. A detailed economic **evalu**ation of the telemedicine mental health network would now be a **major** task. The expansion of telemedic**ine mental health se**rvices has increased the expectations of health-care decision makers. In addition, the **complex**ity of the network has increased and new initiatives, such as the use of telepsychology, have been introduced. Management of t**his suc**cessful telehea**lth prog**ramme continues to be time consuming and challenging. eid: 2-s2.0-0344807705

Aim: To **develop** a telepsychiatry educational **programm**e based on the Primary Care Version of the World Health Organization (WHO) ICD-10 Classification of Mental Disorders and the WHO Mental Disorders in Primary Care train**ing prog**ramme and to **evalu**ate the feasibility of deliver**ing the **programme to primary care mental health practitioners at remote and rural services across Western Australia. Methods: The ICD-10 telepsychiatry educational material **was dev**eloped and formatted onto a navigable CD-ROM disk. There were six clinical modules as recommended by the WHO **educatio**nal programme including: anxiety, depression, alcohol use disorders, sleep problems, chronic tiredness and unexplained somatic c**omplaint**s. This programme was delivered across eight participating sites by simultaneous videoconferencing over six one hour sessions. Knowledge of the material taught was assessed by a specifically designed knowle**dge-e**valuation form before and** after t**he teaching programme. Results: There were 32 participants in total representing several allied mental h**ealth di**sciplines. Post-programme kn**owled**ge evaluation forms were returned by 16 participants (50%). Analysis of the data showed significant improvement in knowledge about anxiety, unexplained somatic complaints, alcohol use disorders and sl**eep diso**rders following the programme. Conclusion: This study provides preliminary evide**nce of t**he effectiveness of our programme in increasing the knowledge of practitioners in regard to the diagnosis and management of key mental disorders common in primary care settings. Furthermore, it demonstrates the feasibility and** accepta**bility of delivering such a programme by simultaneous multi-site videoconferencing to rural and remote locations.  2007 Informa UK Ltd. eid: 2-s2.0-84871480529

Objective: To determine if service **util**ization behaviors varied with the remoteness of clients served by a telepsychology clinic in a predominantly **rural** health professional shortage area (HPSA) in Texas. Methods: Archival data from 290 low-income clients were analyzed to **test** associations between serv**ice **utilization behaviors and clients **distanc**e from the nearby access points where they traveled to receive counseling services from remotely located counselors. Resul**ts: Dis**tance to access points did not predict differences in **serv**ice utilization behaviors. However, clients** in r**ural counties traveled farther to receive services than clients in metropolitan **area**s. Some utilization behaviors varied by demographic variables and depressive symptom severity. Conclusions: A hub and spoke model of telehealth service delivery is an acceptable model for improving access to mental health care serv**ices **in rural and underserved communities, even for clients who live relatively far from access points. Telehealth providers should consider geographic, socioeconomic, transportation, and health-related barriers to care experienced by clients when implementing services and policies.  2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-85076372133
1. **The use of videoconferencing for mental health services in Finland**
The **util**ization of telemental health (TMH) services in **Finland** was surveyed in 2006. In total, 135 health-care units provided responses. Eighty-four responses were received from primary care units (health-care centres and clinics) and eight from other clinics, in all hospital districts. The overall rate of TMH consultations was 4 per 100,000 **popul**ation. The highest TMH consultation **per p**opulation ratio, 22 per 100,000, was in north**ern Fin**land. Most of the sites used telepsychiatry services for less than 10% of clinical outpatient services. The sites with over **20% **utilization of clinical TMH services from all psychiatric consultations were all **rural** health centres. Compared with Finla**nd, **the utilization rates of TMH were higher in Canada; that might be due to differences between the countries in the organization of mental health services in primary and specialized c**are. In** Finland TMH consultations made up only a very small proportion of all mental health services. The use of TMH was particularly common in remote areas; however, there were m**any r**ural centres t**hat **did not utilize clinical TMH.** TMH** was widely utilized for continuing and medical education. eid: 2-s2.0-64549119793

Background: There is a need of continuity of care research in psychiatric disorders to deal two important issues such as accessibility of psychiatrists, and **travel**. Aims: This pilot was designed to evaluate the acceptability, feasibility, possible clinical effectiveness and cost benefit of video based tele-psychiatric aftercare (TAC) clinic from an academic hospital. Methods: Fifty selected patients were recruited to provide direct video-consultations (DVC). Results: This study shows higher **score** on acceptability, **satisfact**ion and respect to privacy on these TAC.

2. **Alcohol abuse management in primary care: An e-learning course**
Background: The mental health knowledge gap challenges public health. The **Alcohol** Abuse Management in Primary Care (AAMPC) is an e-learning **cours**e designed to co**ver alc**ohol-related problems from the primary care perspective. The goal of this study was to verify if the AAMPC was able to enhance healthcare profess**ionals'** alcohol-related problems knowledge. Materials and Methods: One hundred subscriptions for the AAMPC were offered through the federal telehealth program. **The c**ourse was instructor-led and had nine weekly classes, delivered synchronously or asynchronously, at the students' convenience, using a varied array of learning tools. At the beginning, students took a test that provided a positive **score**, related to critical knowledge for clinical management, and a negat**ive s**core, related to misconcep**tions a**bout alcohol-related problems. The test was repeated 2 month**s aft**er course completion. Results: Thirty-three students co**mplet**ed the course. The p**ositi**ve score improved significantly (p<0.001), but not t**he ne**gative score. Students with previous ex**perie**nce with e-courses presented greater improvement **on th**e positive score (p<0.036). Eighty-percent of the s**tuden**ts thought the course excelled in meeting its objectives. Web conferences and video and audio recordings were the most appr**eciat**ed learning tools. Course **satisfact**ion was negatively related to frequency of Internet access (Spearman's rho=-0.455, p=0.022). Conclusions: E-learning was highly appreciated as a learning tool, especially by students with the least frequency of Internet use. Nonetheless, it worked better for those** prev**iously famil**iar w**ith e-courses. The AAMPC e-course provided effective knowledge transmission and retention. Complementary strategies to reduce misco**nceptio**ns about alcohol-related problems must be **develop**ed for the training of primary care staff.

3. **Telepsychiatry and carer education for schizophrenia**
Objective: Despite the scientific evidence, most families of people with **schizophrenia** in Europe never receive a carer education programme. We evaluated whether a carer education **cours**e delivered by telepsychiatry was as effective as a carer educat**ion c**ourse delivered in situ. Method: We delivered the carer ed**ucati**on course **for schizophr**enia simultaneously to a carers group in **rural** north west Ireland (remote) via three ISDN lines and live to a carers group in a city (host). We compared knowledge gains using the Knowledge Questionnaire before and** afte**r each course. Results: Fifty-six carers of peop**le with schiz**ophrenia participated in the trial. At baseline, participants at the remote and host centers did not differ in terms of know**ledge about s**chizophr**enia.** After the course, carers at both centers improved significantly and the knowledge gains between groups were equivalent at 6. weeks. Conclusion: Telepsychiatry can deliver effective carer education p**rogrammes abo**ut schizophrenia and may provide one solution to bridging the chasm between scientific evidence and clinical reality.  2010 Elsevier Masson SAS. eid: 2-s2.0-79960471492

5. **What is the potential for social networks and support to enhance future telehealth interventions for people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia: A critical interpretive synthesis**
Background: Digital technologies are increasingly directed at improved monitoring, management and treatment of mental health. However, their potential contribution to social networks and self-management support for people diagnosed with a serious mental illness has rarely been considered. This review and meta-synthesis aimed to examine the processes of engagement and perceived relevance and appropriateness of telehealth interventions for people with a diagnosis of **schizophrenia**. The review addresses three key questions. How is the use of digital communications technologies framed in the professional psychiatric literature? How might the recognised benefits of telehealth translate to people with a diagnosis** of schizophr**enia? What is the user perspective concerning Internet information and communication technologies?Methods: A critical interpretive synthesis (CIS) of published findings from quantitative and qualitative studies of telehealth interventions for people with a diagn**osis of schiz**ophrenia. Results: Most studies were of an exploratory nature. The professional dis**cours**e about the use of different technologies was overlain by concerns with surveillance and control, focusing on the Internet as a potential site of risk and danger. The critical synthesis of findings showed that the key focus of the available studies was on the delivery of existing traditional approaches (e.g. improving medications adherence, provision of medical information about the condition, symptom monitoring and cognitive behavioural therapy). Even though it was clear that the Internet has considerable potential in terms of accessing and utilising lay support, the potential of communication technologies in mobilising of resources for personal self-management or peer support was a relatively absent or hidden a focus of the available studies. Conclusions: Based on an interpretive synthesis of available studies, people with a d**iagnosis of s**chizophrenia or psychosis use the Internet primarily for the purposes of disclosure and information gathering. Empowerment, regulation and surveillance emerged as the key dimensions of engagement (or not) with telehealth interventions. The findings suggest that telehealth interventions are disproportionately used by particular patient groups (e.g.women, people who are employed). Further research needs to ascertain the mechanisms by which telehealth interventions may be potentially beneficial or harmful for engagement and management to people with** a diagnosis **of schizophrenia.  2013 Daker-White and Rogers; licensee BioMed Central Ltd. eid: 2-s2.0-84886733528
6. **Developing Texting for Relapse Prevention: A Scalable mHealth Program for People with Schizophrenia and Schizoaffective Disorder**
Symptom relapse in people with **schizophrenia** and schizoaffective disorder is common and has a negative impact on the **cours**e of illness. Here, we describe the **develop**ment of Texting for Relapse Prevention, a scalable, cost-effective text messaging relapse prevention program that queries patients' "early warning signs" daily. Results** of dev**elopment focus groups and content advisory teams with 25 patients and 19 providers suggest that patients were enthusiastic about the program and thought that receiving daily messages about their symptoms would help them feel supported. Providers also were positive about the idea but worried that the program might interfere with patient-provider communication if patients thought that the messages were coming from providers. Patients found the content positive and actionable. The program was improved to address this feedback. This it**erative** development process that included multiple stakeholders ensured that the program is feasible and acceptable to both patients and providers.  Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

7. **What format of treatment do patients with emotional disorders prefer and why? Implications for public mental health settings and policies**
Objective We analyzed the preference of three psychological intervention formats-individual, group, and online-in a sample of 267 patients with a primary diagnosis of emotional disorder in Spanish public mental health settings. Method We studied patients' preferences considering sociodemographic characteristics, diagnoses, history of psychological treatments, number of sessions, and **satisfact**ion with past interventions. Results Most participants (85.4%) preferred psychological treatment in an individual format, 14.2% in group, and 0.4% online. When comparing the people who chose individual and group treatment, no demographic or clinical differences were found. The arguments against group format were the lack of privacy and expression difficulties. Regarding online format, these included being considered impersonal and ineffective. Conclusion The rejection of group and online psychotherapy formats allows us to define the actions we should carry out in public mental health settings to improve the acceptance of more costeffective therapy formats.  2019 Osma et al. eid: 2-s2.0-85067042755

Objective: This article provides a description of a pilot telepsychology programme introduced in the Australian Men's Hockey programme in the lead-up to our gold medal World Cup and Commonwealth Games campaigns in 2014. Method: This article is a case description of a novel application of **video**conferencing technology and a reflective practice **evalu**ation of our **initi**al clinical experiences with this technology. Results: Observations and feedback from players and coaches augur well for the acceptability and effectiveness of new technologies in responding to the considerable psychological demands of an increasingly globalised elite sporting context. Despite the usual array of technological challenges, not only did individual sessions become a **critic**al part of ensuring individual well-being but group sessions also contributed to **team** cohesion. Coaching staff also utili**sed v**ideo links to access timely psychological input during tours, and to strengthen multidisciplinary assessments and treatment **plan**ning. Conclusions: The successful application of telepsychology with these exceptionally high-functioning clients in a high-stakes context allayed some of the concerns about telepsychology among the coaching and sport scie**nce **team.

1. **The Future of Telemental Health and Psychology in Australia: Restoring the Psychologically "Clever Country"?**
Australian psychologists have always been challenged to find innovative ways of overcoming the geographical, social, and economic barriers that characterise health care across this vast country. With the rapid digitalisation of communication globally, psychologists are urged to anticipate the ways in which information and communication technology will affect our practice in the future and to pro-actively formulate ways in which we can meet the changing demands for mental health services. Increasingly, research demonstrates that efficacy, clinical effectiveness, cost, and satisfaction are roughly equivalent for telepsychology as traditional face-to-face interventions. If psychologists are to retain a leadership role in the provision of global psychological services, it is imperative that we prepare to make provision to integrate new technologies into our professional practice. This article outlines some barriers and possible strategies to address them as we identify future directions for telemental health and the professional practice of psychology in the Australia.  2015 The Australian Psychological Society. eid: 2-s2.0-84937554546
2. **Post-disaster gulf coast recovery using telehealth**
Objective: The Gulf Coast continues to struggle with service need far outpacing available resources. Since 2005, the **Region**al Coordinating Center for Hurricane Response (RCC) at Morehouse School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, has supported telehealth solutions designed to meet high service needs (e.g., psychiatry) within primary care and other healthcare organizations. The overall RCC vision is to support autonomous, useful, and **sustain**able telehealth programs towards mitigating unmet disaster-related needs. Subjects and Methods: To assess Gulf Coast telehealth experiences, we conducted semistructured interviews with b**oth re**gional key informants and **nation**al organizations with Gulf Coast recovery interests. Using qualitative-descriptive analysis, interview transcripts were analyzed to identify shared **develop**ment themes. Results: Thirty-eight key informants were interviewed, representing a 77.6% participation rate among organizations engaged by the RCC. Seven elements **critic**al to telehealth success were identified: Funding, Regulatory, Workflow, Attitudes, Personnel, Technology, and **Evalu**ation. These key informant accounts reveal shared insights with telehealth regarding successes, challenges, and recommendations. Conclusions: The seven eleme**nts cr**itical to telehealth success both confirm and organ**ize dev**elopment principles from a diverse collective of healthcare stakeholders. The structured nature of these insights suggests a generalizable framework upon which other organization**s might** develop telehealth strategies toward addressing high service needs with limited resources.

4. **Integrating telemedicine and telehealth: putting it all together.**
Telemedicine and telehealth programs are inherently complex compared with their traditional on-site health care delivery counterparts. Relatively few organizations have **develop**ed **sustain**able, multi-specialty telemedicine programs, although single service programs, such as teleradiology and telepsychiatry programs, are common. A number of factors are barriers to **the dev**elopment** of sus**tainable telemedicine and telehealth programs. First, starting programs is often challenging since relatively few organizations have, in house, a **critic**al mass of individuals with the skill sets required to organize and manage a telemedicine program. Therefore, it is necessary to "boot strap" many of the start-up activities using available personnel. Another challenge is to assemble a management **team** that has time to champion telemedicine and telehealth while dealing with the broad range of issues that often confront telemedicine programs. Telemedicine programs housed within a single health care delivery system have advantages over programs that serve as umbrella telehealth organizations for multiple health care systems. **Plan**ning a telemedicine program can **involve** developing a shared vision among the participants, including the parent organizations, management, customers and **the pub**lic. Developing shared visions can be a time-consuming, iterative process. Part** of **planning includes having the partnering organizations and their managem**ent **teams reach a consensus on the **initi**al program goals, priorities, strategies, and impleme**ntat**ion plans. Staffing requirements of telemedicine and telehealth programs may be met by sharing existent resources, hiring additional personnel, or outsourcing activities. Business models, such as the Application Service Provider (ASP) model used by the Arizona Telemedicine Program, are designed to provide staffing flexibility by offering a combi**nation** of in-house and out-sourced services, depending on the needs of the individual participating health care organizations. Telemedicine programs should perform ongoing assessments of activities, ranging from service usage to quality of service assessments, to ongoing analyses of financial performance. The financial assessments should include **evalu**ations of costs and benefits, coding issues, reimbursement, account receivables, bad debt and network utilization. Long-rang**e st**rategic planning for a telemedicine and telehealth program should be carried out on an on-going basis and should include the program's govern**ing **board. This planning process should include goal setting and the periodic updating of the program's vision and mission statements. There can be additional special issues for multi-organization telemedicine and telehealth programs. For example, authority management can require the use of innovative approaches tailored to the realities of the organizational structures of the participating members. Inter-institutional relations may introduce additional issues when competing health care organizations are utilizing shared resources. Branding issues are preferably addressed dur**ing ****the i**nitial planning of a multi-organizational telemedicine and telehealth program. Ideally, public policy regarding telemedicine and telehealth within a service **region** will complement the objectives of telemedicine and telehealth programs within that service area. eid: 2-s2.0-44049092484
5. **Teleconsultation and Training of VHA Providers on Transgender Care: Implementation of a Multisite Hub System**
Background: The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is piloting a **nation**al program providing teleconsultation and training to clinicians to increase knowledge and comfort with treating transgender veterans and to expand clinical capacity. This program is based on Project ECHO and uses specialist expertise to train and educate front-line clinicians. Over time, the front-line clinicians increase knowledge and skills, enabling them to provide care locally and obviate need for patient travel. This program is innovative in **its na**tional scope, interdisciplinary **team** model, and multihub structure. This article describes **develop**ment of the program and **initi**al results for the first cohort of learners. Materials and Methods: Five interdisciplinary clini**cal **teams participated in the 14-session, 7-month progra**m. M**ost teams had some experience treating transgender veterans prior to participation. R**esul**ts: The teams completed at least 12 of 14 sessions. Thirteen of 33 participants completed an **evalu**ation. In general, respondents found the teleconsultation program very helpful and credited the experience with **impr**oving their team functioning. Furthermore, respondents reported a significant increase in confidence to treat transgender veterans by the end of the program (59% versus 83%). We explored whether it is possible to r**ecru**it VHA clinical teams to participate in lengthy training on a low prevalence but complex condition. Conclusions: Early results support the feasibility and effectiveness **of thi**s national VHA teleconsultation and training program for transgender care. Lessons learned from the first group of learners have been applied to two concurrent groups with positive results.  Copyright 2015, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2015. eid: 2-s2.0-84948766201
6. **Feasibility, acceptability, and sustainability of telepsychiatry for children and adolescents**
Objective: This study examined the feasibility, acceptability, and **sustain**ability of a telepsychiatry service for children and adolescents living in nonmetropolitan communities. Methods: Using high- bandwidth interactive **video** teleconferencing, psychiatrists at a children's hospital provided care to patients of primary care physicians at four nonmetropolitan sites. Review of one-year utilization provided feasibility data. Surveys of referring physicians examined acceptability of telepsychiatry. Reimbursement records provi**ded sus**tainability data. Results: Overall, 387 sessions were provided to 172 youths (mean=2.25 sessions) whose clinical profiles were representative of **nation**al samples. Referring providers endorsed high satisfaction with telepsychiatric care, although pediatricians were consistently more satisfied than family phys**icians.** Sustainability of telepsychiatry is challenged by infrastructure costs and low reimbursement by public payers. Conclusions: Telepsychiatry is a feasible and acceptable approach to providing psychiatric services to youths in underserved c**ommunit**ies. Sustainability will depend on **develop**ing financial alternatives to fee-for-service, especially if caseloads emphasize publicly funded programs. eid: 2-s2.0-36749038421
7. **Challenges and perspectives in the private practice of psychiatry: The development of tele-psychiatry [Enjeux et perspectives de la psychiatrie librale: le dveloppement de la tl-psychiatrie]**
Fall 2018 a comprehensive legislation has been launched in France on the practice of telemedicine, hence tele-psychiatry, historically one of its oldest application. This paper resulted from a presentation that has been made at the French Medico-Psychological Society President's Day, and aims at pointing out certain regulatory, ethical, and practical challenges in the **develop**ment of tele-psychiatry, in a truly progressive manner, given its importance to the accelerating processes of digitalisation within our societies. French users of telemedicine services are 4 % only, which has to be compared to 31 % of Saudis: usage has evolved since 2010, year in which the first telemedicine legislation has been implemented in France. In just a few years, mobile health (m-health) has become increasingly important, while the legislation, and the funding models, were unchanged. Psychiatrists practicing telemedicine may simply use **video** consultation, but those who wish to, can also digitalise their practice from case history to analysis and prescription, with dedicated assistance software. In any case, practising telemedicine requires the use of approved software, prior training, and professionalism. Key features of G**ood V**ideo Consultation Practices are described therein, along with broad recommendations on practicing trans**-bord**er video consultation sessions.  2018 Elsevier Masson SAS eid: 2-s2.0-85059465160

Background and objective: The application of e-health technology to the field of **substanc**e use disorders is at a relatively early stage, and methodological quality is still variable. Few have explored the extent of **util**ization of communication technology in exploring **risk** perception by patients enrolled** in subs**tance abuse services.The Overd**ose **RIsk InfOrmatioN (**ORION**) project is a European Commission funded programme, aimed to **develop** and pilot an e-health psycho-educational **tool** to provide information to drug using individuals ab**out **the risks of suffering a drug overdose. Methods: In this article, we report **on p**hase 1 (risk estimation), phase 2 (design), and phase 3 (feasibility) of **the O**RION project. Results: **The dev**elop**ment **of ORION e-hea**lth **tool underlined the importance of an evidence-based intervention aimed in obtaining reliabl**e ev**aluation of risk. Th**e OR**ION tool supported a decision making process aimed at influenc**ing the **substance users' self-efficacy and the degree t**o which **the substanc**e us**ers' understand risk factors. Therefore, its innovative power c**onsi**sted in translating risks combination into a clear estimation for the user who will then appear more likely **to b**e interested in his/her risk perception.

Individuals with intellectual disability experience higher rates of mental illness when compared with the general population, and there is a lack of medical and mental health professionals in **rural** and under-served areas. With the increase in discharge of individuals from institutional settings back to their home communities into the least restrictive environments, there are more patients with complex needs being added to the schedules of physicians in the outpatient delivery care **system**. Patients with disabilities may not travel well or tolerate changes in routine so may not have access to psychiatry. Utilization of telepsychiatry is well suited to this specialized patient population because it allows a highly traumatized group to meet with a psychiatrist and other mental health professionals from a location of their choice. Ohios Telepsychiatry **Project** for Intellectual Disability was initiated in 2012 to serve outlying communities with a lack of infrastructure and resources, to provide specialized **mental health servic**es to individuals with co-occurring mental illness and intellectual disability. After five years, over 900 patients with intellectual disability from 64 of Ohios 88 counties receive specialized mental health treatment through this statewide grant-fun**ded pro**ject.  2017, The Author(s) 2017. eid: 2-s2.0-85029819907

2. **The fall and rise of the South Australian telepsychiatry network**
The **Rural** and Remote **Mental Health Servic**e (RRMHS) has delivered telepsychiatry services through the use of videoconferencing to South **Australia**n communities since May 1994. The survivability of the service results from a combination of factors that have seen the RRMHS expand to 48 centres and deliver an average of 100 clinical sessions a month. The key factors responsible for the success of the service lie in the model of service delivery, management support, and the implementation of a **system** for the scheduling and reporting of videoconference activity. The current model of service delivery has evolved over the past seven years and is fundamentally different to the infrastructure established at the implementation stage of the **project**. A retrospective analysis shows the shift in service delivery models necessary for the **sustain**ability of telepsychiatry services in So**uth Austr**alia. eid: 2-s2.0-0042762614

0. **Predicting engagement with an online psychosocial intervention for psychosis: Exploring individual- and intervention-level predictors**
Background: Individuals with **psychosi**s demonstrate positive attitudes towards utilising digital technology in mental health treatment. Although preliminary research suggests digital interventions are feasible and acceptable in this **popul**ation, little is known about how to best **promot**e engagement with these resources. Candidate predictors include therapist support, sources of motivation and recovery style. Understanding what factors predict engagement will **aid** more effective **design** and implementation of digital interventions to improve clinical benefits. Objective: This study aimed to investigate demographic, psychological, and treatment variables that predict overall and type of engagement with a psychosocial, online intervention for individuals w**ith psyc**hosis. Methods: Ninety-eight participants with a his**tory of **psychosis were given access to a **web** program containing modules on self-management and recovery, which they were asked to use flexibly at their own pace. Activity was automatically logged by the **system**. Baseline measures of demographics, recovery style and motivation were administered, and participants were randomised to receive eit**her** website access al**one**, or website access plus weekly, asynchronous emails from an online coach over 12 weeks. Log and baseline assessment data were used in negative binomial regressions to examine predictors of depth and breadth of use over the intervention **period**. A logistic regression was used to examine the impact of predictor variables on usage profiles (active or passive). Results: Depth and breadth of engagement were positively predicted by receiving email support, low levels of externally controlled moti**vat**ions for website use, older age, and having a tertiary education. There was a significant interaction between level of controlled motivation and condition (+/email) on breadth and depth of engagement: receiving asynchronous emails was associated with increased engagement for individuals with low, but not high, levels of externally controlled motivations. Receiving email support and more autonomous motivations for treatment predicted more ac**tiv**e use of the website. Conclusions: Asynchronous email support **can pr**omote engagement with online interventions for indiv**iduals w**ith psychosis, potentially enabling self-management of illness and improving clinical outcomes. However, those using online interventions due to external motivating factors, may have low levels of engagement with the intervention, irrespective of coaching provided. These findings may gu**ide de**sign and implementation of future online interventions in t**his p**opulation.  2019 The Authors eid: 2-s2.0-85070855127
1. **Usability of online psychoeducation for siblings of people with psychosis**
Objectives: The E Sibling Project aims to address the needs of siblings of individuals affected by **psychosi**s through provision of a comprehensive online intervention. The online intervention comprises four core elements, including: information** on psyc**hosis; various coping and **promot**ing well-being strategies; siblings' blogs and discussion forum with peers; and an Ask the Experts function. After the intervention-prototype was developed, we tested its feasibility, usability and acceptability by siblings. Methods: We **evalu**ated the usability of the intervention-prototype using a non-randomised usability study with siblings of individuals diagnos**ed with **psychosis. The usability study adapted Poulson et al's framework to collect subjective feedback from participants on ease of use, perceived usefulness and acceptability, together with objective usage data on the intervention. Results: Twenty siblings were recruited to the usability test; 19 tried out the resource-prototype over a 4-week **period** and 17 completed the onl**ine e**valuation after using the intervention. In total, 906 page-views were made by the participants and each spent about two hours using the resource. Parti**cipan**ts evaluated the intervention as helpful, relevant and useful in terms of content, **design** and usability. Developments are needed to improve the navigation and intuitiveness of the resource. Conclusions: Using an internet-based information-giving and peer support intervention** to pr**omote wellbeing and coping is feasible and acceptable to siblings of **people w**ith psychosis.

2. **Process of design and usability evaluation of a telepsychology web and virtual reality system for the elderly: Butler**
Butler is a multi-application **system** based on Internet technology and virtual reality, **design**ed to meet the needs of elderly users. Its objectives are to assist elderly **popul**ations in accessing technology and new forms of communication, replicating, as far as possible the way of lineal interaction that t**his p**opulation group had traditionally to interact with information in order to facilitate the first contacts with technology. Butler is equipped with e-mail, videoconferencing, blogging, access to the Internet through a well-known **web** search engine, image and sound gallery, new contacts searcher, and two virtual reality environments. In this paper we describe Butler's most relevant features taking into account the usabil**ity de**sign process and the usability **evalu**ation of **the sy**stem, which, after pilot testing, have proven to be highly acceptable and satisfactory to users. We also present the results** of e**valuations pertaining to the iconography used in the program, the navigation and user**s' hel**p design process, and the first functional prototype, all of** which** were** desig**ned and redesigned with the **aid**** of** web heuristics and gui**deline**s **for** the web design for elderly users. Results suggest important features to be **taken **into account when designing and developing this sort of application for the elderly.  2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Most studies on coping among persons with severe mental illness have relied on retrospective self-report methods; a limitation of this methodology is susceptibility to recall bias. The purpose of the present investigation was to expand the **current** understanding of the impact of coping among persons with severe mental illness by examining coping strategies, mood, and social functioning (operationalized as productive time use) using a daily process design. Twenty-seven adults diagnosed with severe mental illness completed baseline clinical interviews and up to 20 days of nightly tele**phone** interviews addressing coping and daily life. A total of 198 coping efforts were reported for 387 days. Mixed-effects regression analyses examined the association between type of daily coping strategy (problem-centered, neutral, or avoidant) and both daily proportion of time participants spent in productive activity and daily negative mood, controlling for demographic and clinical variables. The results indicated that productive time use was significantly lower on days when avoidant strategies were used, in contrast with days when problem-centered strategies and neutral strategies were used. There was no significant main effect of coping on negative mood, although there was a trend in the expected direction. Findings support the hypothesis that the types of coping strategies adults with severe mental illness use are related to better social functioning on a daily level.  2010 Elsevier B.V. eid: 2-s2.0-78249245684
1. **'SMS' for mental health - Feasibility and acceptability of using text messages for mental health promotion among young women from urban low income settings in India**
Objective: The **current** study assesses the acceptability and feasibility of **mobil**e text messages for promoting positive mental health and as a helpline among **young** women in urban slums of Bangalore. Methodology: Forty girls in the age range of 16-18 years from urban slums received messages every day for a month. They could call or message back or give a 'missed call' to the same number whenever they had emotional problems or felt like talking to a counselor. The received responses in the form of return texts, missed calls and return **phone** calls were recorded. Feedback about the feasibility and acceptability of **the m**obile messages was collected after a month. Results: 25 out of 40 (62.5%) participants called back, asking for **mental health servic**es and to say they felt good about the messages. 23 of 40 (57.5%) messaged back regarding their feelings. 62% reported that they felt supported with the mental health messages. Male family members of nearly half of the participants called back to check the authenticity of the source. Most women did not face any problems because of the messages. Conclusion: This pilot **qualit**ative study indicat**es th**at mobile text messages are a feasible and culturally acceptable method for mental health promotion and prevention am**ong y**oung women from urban slums in India. Issues such as consent from the woman and family, ensuring confidentiality and providing authentic and reliable support services, need to be taken into account before attempting to scale up such a service, particularly in vulnerable groups.  2014 Elsevier B.V. eid: 2-s2.0-84912031259
2. **A qualitative study of young people's perspectives on receiving psychiatric services via televideo**
Objective: It is critical to consult **young** people about their experiences. This study addresses the paucity of research on the perspective** of y**oung people in general, and in paediatric telepsychiatry specifically. The goal is to understand the experi**ence **of young people receiving telepsychiatry. Method: Interpretive interactionism (Denzin, 1989) was used to i**nterv**iew 30 young people; immediately following the consultation and four to six weeks later. Analysis occurred via a series of steps in keeping with the interpretive interactionist framework. Results: Four themes arose repeatedly: the encounter with the psychiatrist and experience of having others in the room; the helpfulness of the session; a sense of personal choice during the consultation; and, the technology. Participants highlighted the **import**ance of their relationship with the psychiatrist. Participant's narratives were replete with examples of ways that they actively took responsibility and exerted control within the session itse**lf. C**onclusion: Young people have a significant role to play in their own care. It is critical that telepsychiatry recommendations be explained an**d opp**ortunities for young people to express their concerns and discuss alternatives are provided. Fur**ther **efforts to include young people may include ensuring offering alternate treatments and/or negotiated when recommended treatments are unacceptable and/or resisted. eid: 2-s2.0-77949602145

4. **A mobile phone program to track young people's experiences of mood, stress and coping**
Background: Research examining **adolesc**ent mood, stresses, and coping has tended to use retrospective questionnaires which are affected by recall biases. The aim of this study was to develop, pilot, and evaluate a youth-friendly **mobil**e **phone** program to monitor, in real-time, **young** people's everyday experiences of mood, stress, and their coping behaviours. Method and design: A momentary sampling program was designed **for m**ob**ile p**hones, and ran for 7 days, administering a brief questionnaire four random times each day, capturing information on **current** activity, mood, responses to negative mood, stresses, alcohol and cannabis use. Eleven high school students reviewed the program in focus groups, and 18 students completed 7 days of monitoring. Results: Engagement w**ith t**he mobile type program was high with 76% of 504 possible entries completed and 94% (17/18) of the participants reporting that the program adequately captured their moods, thoughts, and acti**vitie**s. The mobiletype program captured meaningful and analyzable data on the **way y**oung people's moods, stresses, coping strategies, and alcohol and cannabis use, vary both between and within individuals. C**onclu**sions: The mobile type program captured a range of detailed and interesting **qualit**ative and quantitative dat**a abo**ut young people's everyday mood, stresses, responses, and general functioning.

5. **Perspectives of Young Adults on Receiving Telepsychiatry Services in an Urban Early Intervention Program for First-Episode Psychosis: A Cross-Sectional, Descriptive Survey Study**
Background: Limited knowledge exists on telepsychiatry in specialized services for first-episode psychosis (FEP), despite its potential for improving service access and engagement. Objective: To explore access and use of technology, obstacles to attending clinic appointments, and perspectives of **young** adults with FEP on using telepsychiatry as part of outpatient services. Methods: A cross-sectional, descriptive survey study was conducted between July and October 2017 w**ith y**oung adults between the ages of 18 and 38 recruited from a specialized program for FEP in an urban Canadian setting. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and content analysis. Results: Among 51 participants (mean age = 26.1, SD = 4.2; 59% male; 20% experiencing housing instability), more than half (59%, n = 30) rarely or never used mainstream video chat (e.g., Facetime). The majority (78%, n = 40) reported obstacles to attending appointments, with several (37%, n = 19) identifying two or more. Almost half (49%, n = 25) were very favorable towards telepsychiatry and a quarter (25%, n = 13) were somewhat favorable. Participants expressed several concerns about telepsychiatry, including loss of human contact and confidentiality. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is a first study on the perspectives of individuals with FEP about telepsychiatry. Despite experiencing obstacles to attending appointments and expressing receptivity towards telepsychiatry, participants did not have access to these services. It is **import**ant to provide education to clinicians on the potential of telepsychiatry to improve service access. Also, more research is needed on when, where, and how telepsychiatry can be integrated into existing care while addressing patient and clinician concerns.

1. **Continuing professional development for Australian rural psychiatrists by videoconference**
Objective: The **Rural** Special Interest Group (RSIG) of the Royal ****Australia**n** and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists provided a program of educational meetings for psychiatrists and trainees** in r**ural locations to decrease **profession**al **isol**ation and facilitate opportunities to obtain credit for continu**ing profes**sional **develop**ment (CPD) purposes in **ongoing pr**ofessional registration. A pilot peer review group by videoconference was also implemented in West**ern Austr**alia, to provide peer review for psychiatrists working** in **isolation. Method: Six national interactive videoconferenced education seminars were provided. The membership was polled prior to the program for topic preferences and requested speakers, who were subsequently approached to present the seminars. A W**est Austra**lian peer review group was formed, involving psychiatrists from five di**ffere**nt rural locations and one psychiatrist from the metropolitan area. Results: National seminars were attended by 106 individuals (67% consultant psychiatrists, 17% trainees and 16% al**lied healt**h professionals). Evaluation demonstrates favourable views of the content and quality of the presentations and impact on practice patterns. Conclusions: Attendance at seminars via videoconferenci**ng pr**ovided rural psychiatrists with opportunities to obtain CPD credit without the need to travel, providing a cost-effective alternative for accessing education. Involvement enabled interaction among peers throughout Austral**ia, allevi**ating profe**ssio**nal isolation and generating networking opportunities.

Recent advances in communication technologies have the capacity for addressing many of the challenges identified with **rural** and **remot**e social work practice, such as scarcity of **profession**al resourc**es, profes**sional **isol**ation and limited access to supervis**ion and pr**ofessional **develop**ment. The purpose of this exploratory, qualitative study was to examine **how dev**elopments in communication technologies have influenced the way social workers practise social work** in r**ural **and r**emote Canadian areas. In-depth interviews were conducted with thirty-seven clinicians. The findings suggested that having access to communication resources, such as the internet, Telehealth and Telepsychiatry, appears to be positively addressing some is**sues **of rural and northern practice. While the role of communication technologies could be **further** developed as a means of addressing some of the limitations of distanc**e and fewe**r professional resources in these areas, it simultaneously risks imposing an urban-centric bias upon social work **pract**ice in ru**ral a**nd remote communities. eid: 2-s2.0-77949297975
3. **The reported benefits of telehealth for rural Australians**
Objective. A literature review was conducted to identify the reported benefits attributed to telehealth for people living and **profession**als working in **rural** and **remot**e areas of **Australia**. Data sources.Scopus and relevant journals and websites were searched using the terms: telemedicine, telehealth, telepsychiatry, teledermatology, teleradiolo**gy, Austr**alia, and each state and territory. Publications since 1998 were included. Study selection.The initial search resulted in 176 articles, which was reduced to 143 when research reporting on Austral**ian r**ural, regional** or r**emote populations was selected. Data synthesis.A narrative review was conducted using an existing 'benefits' framework. Patients are reported to have benefited from: lower costs and reduced inconvenience while accessing specialist health services; improved access to services and improved quality of clinical services. Hea**lth profes**sionals are reported to have benefited from: access to continuing educat**ion and pr**ofessional **develop**ment; **provis**ion of enhanced local services; experiential learning, networking and collaboration. Dis**cussi**on.**Rural **A**ustralian**s have reportedly benefited from telehealth. The reported improved access and quality of clinical care a**vaila**ble to ru**ral Austra**lians through telemedicine and telehealth may contribute to decr**easin**g the urbanrural health disparities. T**he reporte**d professio**nal dev**elopment opportunities and support from specialists through the use of telehealth may con**tribu**te to improved rural medical workforce recruitment and retention. What is known about the topic An extensive international literature has reported on the efficacy of telehealth, and to a lesser extent the clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness of telemedicine. Systematic reviews conclude that the quality of the studies preclude definitive conclusions being drawn about clinical and cost-effectiveness, although there is some evidence of effective clinical outcomes and the potential for cost-benefits. Little attention has been paid to the benefits reported** for **people who live in ru**ral a****nd remo**te Australia, despite this being a rationale f**or th**e use of telehealth i**n rur**al and remote locations. What **does **this paper add Patien**ts in** rural and remo**te locati**ons in Australia are reported to benefit from telehealth by increased access to health services and up**-skilled h**ealth pr**ofessional**s. Health professionals are reported to benefit from telehealth by up-skilling from increased contact with specialists **and increa**sed access to profe**ssional** development. The review findings suggest that one strategy, the increased use of telehealth, has the potential to reduce the inequitable access to health services and** the **poorer health status that man**y rural Au**stralians experience, and contribute to addressing the on-going problem **of th**e recruitment and retention of the rural health workforce. What are the implications for practitioners The use of telehea**lth a**ppears to be a path to up-ski**lling** for rural and remote practitioners.  2010 AHHA. eid: 2-s2.0-77956332819

0. **Thinking Outside the Box: Are We Ready for Teleprecepting to Expand Training and Practice Venues?**
A significant challenge related to nurse practitioner (NP) training is the shortage of clinical sites with qualified faculty to precept NP interns. The problem is compounded in **rural** communities with provider shortages, restricting their opportunities to train (and potentially recruit) new APRNs. Consequently, these **underserv**ed communities have difficulty accessing specialty providers, such as Psychiatric Mental Health Nurse Practitioners (PMHNPs). Combined with geographic distance from **urban** communities and generally lower pay, m**any r**ural and/or remote communities struggle with the disparity in contrast to more **popul**ated regions. A needs assessment of** an under**served county with poor access to psychiatric services suggests that contracted telepsychiatry was costly and failed to address the long-term dearth of **local** psychiatric providers. Stakeholders reported t**hat l**ocal RNs (and possibly FNPs) were employed** by t**he local hospital and that a subgroup may have aptitude and interest in psychiatry if a university program and preceptors were available. Collaborating with** an u**rban PMHNP program, televideo technology for clinical training and preceptor **develop**ment offers a solution to the dearth of preceptors. A pilot intervention will use teleprecepting aimed at establishing best practice guidelines for implementation of this novel approach to expanding the clinical training and capa**city **in rural and under-served communities.  2019,  2019 University of California San Francisco. eid: 2-s2.0-85055985260
1. **Health-related quality of life of rural clients seeking telepsychology services**
Sixty million US residents live in **rural** areas, but health policies and interventions **develop**ed from an **urban** mindset often fail to address the significant barriers to health experienced by these **local** communities. Telepsychology, or psychological services delivered by distance via technology, is an emerging treatment modality with special implications for underser**ved r**ural areas. This study found that a sa**mple **of rural residents seeking telepsychology services (n = 94) had low health-related quality of life (HRQOL), often due to cooccurring physical and mental health diagnoses including high rates of depression. However, a brief telepsychology treatment d**elive**red to rural clients (n = 40) was associated with an improvement in mental health-related quality of life (d = 0.70, P <.001). These results indicate that despite the complex health needs of these **underserv**ed communities, telepsychology interventions may help offset the disparities in health se**rvice** access in rural areas.  2014 Kevin R.

2. **The evolution of a community-based telepsychiatry program in rural Alabama: Lessons learned - A brief report**
The purpose of this paper is to describe the partnership between a community-based **rural** mental health clinic and an academic health center to provide telepsychiatry services** in r**ural Alabama. The partnership was **develop**ed to meet the needs of a clinic that serves an unde**rserv**ed **rural **popul****ation with limited psychiatric services. This paper offers valuable lessons learned for mental health practitioners who may be considering the benefits and challenges of forming community-based partnerships in use of telepsychiatry to build capacity to deliver clinical mental health **servi**ces to rural mental health shortage areas.  2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC. eid: 2-s2.0-84872603652
3. **A Review of Mental Health Approaches for Rural Communities: Complexities and Opportunities in the Canadian Context**
Three mental health approaches with potential relevance to **rural** Canada were reviewed: telepsychiatry, integrated mental health models, and community-based approaches. These approaches have been evaluated in relation to their cost-effectiveness, comprehensiveness, client-centredness, cultural appropriateness, acceptability, feasibility and fidelity; criteria that may vary ami**dst r**ural contexts. Collaborative approaches to care, technologies fully integrated into **local** health systems, multi-sectoral capacity-building, and further engagement with informal social support networks may be particularly promising strate**gies **in rural communities. More research is required t**o det**ermine rural mental health pathways among diverse social groups, and further, to establish the acceptability of novel approaches in mental health. eid: 2-s2.0-84959270278
4. **Estimating the economic impact of telemedicine in a rural community**
One commonly discussed benefit of broadband access in **rural** America is the potential for telemedicine visits that al**low r**ural residents to take advantage of **urban**ized medical services. While the primary benefit of telemedicine is often viewed as improved health care access, the availability of these services also offers significant economic contributions to the **local** community. Site visit**s to **24 rural hospitals of varying size over a four-state area in the Midwest provide information to **develop** a methodology for estimating telemedicine's economic impact. Using this technique, telemedicine services contribute between $20,000 and $1.3M annually to th**ese l**ocal economies, with an average of $522,000.  2011 Northeastern Agricultural and Resource Economics Association. eid: 2-s2.0-83455225285
5. **Rural mental health: Implications for telepsychiatry in clinical service, workforce development, and organizational capacity**
In Hawai'i, **rural** residents suffer disproportionately from poor health and mental health outcomes. Hawai'i's island geography ma**kes r**ural health service disparities especially compelling. Physician workforce shortages are projected to increase, despite 30 years of programs aimed at recruiting physic**ians **to rural areas. Telepsychiatry has been shown to be a feasible way to provide a variety of health services to individual**s liv**ing in rural areas with limited access to healthcare. The Univer**sity **of Hawai'i **Rural Health** Collaboration (UHRHC) was established by the Department of Psychiatry to address the need for workfo**rce d**evelopment and rural access to **mental health servic**es across the State of Hawai'i by using telepsychiatry. Partnerships with community health clinics have been formed to provide patient care and consultation-liaison services through telepsychiatry technology. In addition, UHRHC focuses on workforce **develop**ment in its residency training curriculum by utilizing a servi**ce-le**arning approach to rural mental health. Evaluation of these efforts is currently underway, with preliminary evidence suggesting that UHRHC is a promising strategy to increase access to criti**cal mental health se**rvices and r**educe** health disparities in rural Hawai'i.

6. **Rural jail telepsychiatry: A pilot feasibility study**
New York State has a large **rural** **popul**ation, and many of the jails** in r**ural areas have minimal or no psychiatric services available on site. Cost of transport to off-site psychiatric services and the safety issues related to moving inmates from a secure building may limit inmate access to appropriate psychiatric services. This feasibility study describes a project that provided telepsychiatric consultation to increase access to psychiatric treatment in an unde**rserv**ed rural jail in upstate New York. Subjects were consenting jail inmates who requested or were found to be in need of psychiatric care. The project provided interactive two-way audio-video communication between the psychiatrist located in an **urban** university medical center and subjects who were incarcerated 182 miles away. During the project period, 15 inmates were assessed and treated in 37 consultations. Subjects were predominantly young white males with anxiety, mood, and substance use disorders. Services were readily accepted by inmates and staff. Telepsychiatric examination and treatment appears to be a feasible method to increase access to mental hea**lth c**are in rural jails. Future advocacy for increased mental hea**lth s**ervices in rural areas in criminal justice setting is likely to depend on further evidence of favorable cost benefit.

7. **Attitudes toward medical and mental health care delivered via telehealth applications among rural and urban primary care patients**
Adequate health care services are often not available in **rural** and remote areas, and this problem is expected to grow worse in the near future. "Telehealth" interventions represent a strategy for addressing access to care problems. We examined and compared attitudes toward medical and mental health care delivered via telehealth applications among ad**ult r**ural (n = 112) and **urban** (n = 78) primary care patients. We also examined attitudes toward telehealth applications among a subset of patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-a group likely in need of specialized services. Both ur**ban a**nd rural patients were receptive to receiving medical and psychiatric services via telehealth. There were few meaningful differences across variables betwee**n urb**an and rural patients, and there were no meaningful differences by PTSD status. These findings support the feasibility of telehealth applications, p**artic**ularly for rural patients who may not otherwise receive needed services.  2008 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-39149100645
8. **Psychiatric Mental Health Nurse Practitioners Meeting Rural Mental Health Challenges**
OBJECTIVE: To describe the current **rural** mental health system crisis in the United States and how psychiatric mental health nurse practitioners (PMHNPs) can holistically mitigate this systemic issue. METHOD: Respective to the objective, relevant literature is reviewed. RESULTS: PMHNPs have successfully increased access to care in underser**ved r**ural communities by practicing at the fullest extent of their scope without mandated supervision, utilizing telepsychiatry practice, while expandin**g PMH**NP rural mental health education and research to meet and absol**ve pr**essing rural mental health challenges. CONCLUSIONS: Current evidenc**e sup**ports that rural mental health care improves when PMHNPs have full scope of practice, utilize telepsychiatry, engage in related scholarly activity, and have formalized educati**on an**d training for ****rural health** car**e delivery, which collectively answer the professional and moral call **servi**ng the **underserv**ed **rural **popul****ation with mental illness.

0. **Bioethical principles available in therapeutic communication through SMS**
There is a new concept applicable in health communication: **electron**ic health communication, or simply: e-health communication. The usage of e-health technologies in modern and psychological practice generates a series of bioethical issues and methodological challenges never encountered before. This article sets as **main** objective the identification of the bioethical aspects involved in the early forms of telemedicine and telepsychology, namely the ones obtained through the cell phone. The focus will be on SMS (short message service) - affordable and interactive application - that provides real interactions among patients and healthcare providers, **help**ing to improve access to the medical and psychological services for remote rural communities and marginal population. In general, the studies testing the SMS efficiency in practice have positive feedback, covering several medical and psychological specialties (diabetes, nutrition diseases, cardiology, contagious diseases, ENT, obstetrics - gynecology, psychiatry, clinical psychology, psychotherapy, educational counselling, and others). A rigorous and systematic analysis of the bioethical issues involved (benefits, risks, autonomy, informed contentment, non-discrimination) can clarify some of the controversies that arise in this revolutionary field. In the same time, such an analysis is likely to provide procedural openings, and technical and legal actions in telemedicine and telepsychology. The article also examines the possibility that these new practices would be introduced in Romania, in the interests of patients and of public health politics. There are auspicious premises as at the end of the year 2012 were, according to official statistics, 25.5 millions of cell phones users, who sent 909 million of SMS, out of 10.1 millions accessing the internet from their cell phones. eid: 2-s2.0-84902812553
1. **Telepsychiatry in Polish patients' and doctors' opinion**
BACKGROUND: Telepsychiatry is a new method of medical care, using modern communication technologies and **electron**ic informations. It consists of web pages, containing data about diseases and their treatment in the form of multimedia libraries with video- and audiobooks. This research concerns verification of knowledge and attitude to telepsychiatry amongst patients and psychiatrists.SUBJECTS AND METHODS: An anonymous survey was conducted amongst 105 psychiatrists aged 26-74, including 74 women and 31 men and 102 patients aged 21-79, including 61 women and 41 men.RESULTS: Research reveals that majority of patients never met with the concept of 'telepsychiatry' and do not know what it means. However, more than 50% of respondents answered positively to every question considering the utility of telepsychiatry. Furthermore according to 18% it is possible to replace eye-to-eye conversation by videoconferencing. Only 15% of doctors claim to have an extensive knowledge on telepsychiatry, and 10% do not know what it means. The vast majority of physicians perceive positive aspects of this method of medical care, but 63% would not want general insertion of telepsychiatry. Doctors are apprehensive of losing **person**al data and medical confidentiality, and of the necessity of legal changes as well.CONCLUSION: The obtained results allow us to conclude that Polish patients and doctors, regardless of their knowledge, age, gender or disease, perceive advantages of telepsychiatry. In connection with this, implementing this method into the Polish medical market makes sense and is in accordance with both patients' and doctors' opinion. Based on our research, we confirmed that there is a necessity of wider popularization of telepsychiatry in Polish therapeutics. eid: 2-s2.0-84952775808

3. **Women's use of online resources and acceptance of e-mental health tools during the perinatal period**
Objectives The women's professional **help**-seeking rate for perinatal depression is low, despite the prevalent and disabling nature of this condition. Therefore, new approaches should be implemented to increase women's access and utilization of treatment resources, namely e-mental health tools. This study aimed to characterize women's current pattern of use of online resources for mental heal issues and women's acceptance of e-mental health tools during the perinatal period, and to investigate its **main** determinants. Methods This study used an online cross-sectional survey that was completed by 546 women during the perinatal period. Results 31.3% had prior knowledge of websites targeting mental health illness. Women presenting an actual need **for **help (i.e., a positive screen for depression) reported greater use of online resources and greater engagement in e-health behaviors related to mental health (d=0.460.61), and being more accepting of e-mental health tools, particularly of informative websites. Women's perceptions concerning the e-mental tools were found to predict their intentions to use them. Conclusions The results seem to globally support Portuguese women's acceptance of e-mental health tools. To improve the level of acceptance, women should be involved as stakeholders in the development of new e-mental health tools and provided with specific information before their utilization.  2016 eid: 2-s2.0-84982824306
4. **Innovative new technologies to identify and treat traumatic brain injuries: Crossover technologies and approaches between military and civilian applications**
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has become the signature injury of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom. The use of improvised explosive devices has seen an exponential increase in both Iraq and Afghanistan. In previous conflicts prior to Iraq, survivability of such an injury was far less. Today, technological improvements in trauma care have increased an injured warfighter's chance of survival. A reduction in severe TBI has been achieved but an increase in mild or moderate TBI has been observed. The consequences of this kind of injury can be both physical and mental and can often be hidden or even misdiagnosed. The U.S. Army is interested in pursuing technological solutions for early detection and treatment of TBI to reduce its lasting impact on the warfighter. Such technological breakthroughs have benefit beyond the military, as TBI is a high probable event in nonmilitary settings as well. To gauge what technologies or methods are currently available, the U.S. Army's Telemedicine and Advanced Technology Research **Center** partnered with the American Telemedicine Association to organize and conduct a discipline-specific symposium entitled "Innovative New Technologies to Identify and Treat Traumatic Brain Injuries: Crossover Technologies and Approaches Between Military and Civilian Applications." This symposium was held in Palm Springs, CA, in September 2009. The purpose of the meeting was to provide a unique opportunity for leaders from disparate organizations involved in telemedicine and related other activities to meet and explore opportunities to collaborate in new partnership models. The meeting was designed to **help** Telemedicine and Advanced Technology Resea**rch Ce**nter identify opportunities to expand strategic operations and form new alliances. This report summarizes this symposium while raising awareness for collaboration into better ways of adapting and adopting technologies to address this growing health issue.  2010, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-77952351531
5. **Psychological online consultation service attracts men: A new approach to close the gap between being ill and being treated**
Background: Since 1999, the University Hospital Zurich (Zurich, Switzerland) has offered an e-mail-based consultation service for individual health concerns where anonymous questions can be asked to an online doctor. This study aimed at the characterization of the user profile, the content of the question, and the answers given specific in the field of psychiatry. Materials and Methods: In total, 3,148 questions were asked from 2008 to 2010. Of these, 209 (6.6%) requests were selected by International Classification of Diseases-10 and International Classification of Primary Care codes relevant for psychiatry and included in the retrospective qualitative study. The content analysis of the requests was supported by means of the Mayring inductive category system using a professional text analysis program (MAXQDA). Results: Of the users, 45.9% were female, and 46.9% were male. The mean age was 37.4 years. The **main** topics of the request were somatoform, somatization, and hypochondriac disorders in 18.4%, behavioral syndromes in 17.9%, and mood disorders in 15.4%. The reason stated most frequently for using the service was looking for a second opinion. The doctors responded with detailed information about disease and treatment and in 70.8% recommended consultation of a physician. Conclusions: Telemedicine is suggested to empower patients by developing health literacy with professional advice. The gender ratio of the users is almost equal, although the prevalence of psychological diseases in the general population is higher in women than in men. Psychological online consultation may potentially reach mentally ill individuals who do not have or did not seek professional **help** yet, and it seems to be especially attractive for men.  2015, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-84921509769
6. **A telepsychiatry transition clinic: The first 12 months experience**
To improve the management of soldiers with combat-related mental health problems, an interdisciplinary telepsychiatry service was established between a clinic at the Fort Bragg army base and the Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical **Center** in Salem. In the first 12 months of operation, 120 soldiers (105 males) were seen in a total of 394 telepsychiatry sessions. The time spent on telepsychiatry by the six VA psychiatrists increased from 13 hours in the first month to 41 hours in the twelfth month. The number of telepsychiatry sessions increased from nine in the first month to 56 in the twelfth month. The mean global assessment of function score (GAF) in the soldiers increased significantly (P<0.001) from 58.0 at intake to 62.3 at the last visit. Soldiers received VA telepsychiatry on average 22 days after the initial consultation with a primary care provider, a reduction of at least eight days compared to the previous delay. The majority of soldiers (89%) who were treated by VA psychiatrists enrolled in the VA within about six months of discharge. Similar VA-US Military collaborations may prove beneficial for other military bases that have returning combat soldiers. eid: 2-s2.0-80052157726
7. **Soldiers' personal technologies on deployment and at home**
Objective: **Person**al technologies such as smartphones, computers, and gaming devices, are ubiquitous in the civilian world. Consequently they represent ideal vehicles for disseminating psychological and other health resources and interventions. However, almost nothing is known ab**out pe**rsonal technology use in the U.S. military. We conducted the most comprehensive survey to date of the use, availability, and n**eed fo**r personal technologies by U.S. military service members. Our survey asked detailed questions about computers and the Internet, phones and smartphones, other mobile or portable technologies, gaming devices, and TV and video media used during deployment and at permanent duty station or home. Materials and Methods: We collected data by paper-and-pencil survey in 2010 and 2011 from 331 active Army service members at a processing and registration **center** in a large military installation in the western United States. Two cohorts were surveyed: Soldiers who had previously been deployed to a warzone and soldiers who had never been deployed. Results and Conclusion: We measured hi**gh rat**es of personal technology use by service members at home across all popular **electron**ic media. Soldiers at home essentially resembled civilian consumers in their use of popular technologies. Some technologies, including the Internet, gaming, and TV, were widespread on deployment. Others, most notably cellphones, were more restricted by availability, connectivity, opportunity, and military regulation in the warzone. Results will enable researchers and technology developers target their efforts on the most promising and popular technologies for psychological health in the military.

Building on the work of Pomerantz and Handelsman (2004) and Handelsman and Galvin (1988), this article presents a modern suggested framework for facilitating and enhancing the **informed cons**ent process for telepsychology. With the proliferation of mainstream online psychotherapy services across the past decade, new challenges for therapists and clients have emerged. Although the American Psychological Association (2013a) has published general guidelines for telepsychology practice, clinicians and clients may benefit from a more in-depth, illustrative model from which to develop telepsychol**ogy informed ****consent** processes. Like its predecessors, this version contains questions clients have the **right** to discuss with their psychologists; however, unlike its antecedents, this version is presented as a modular template that can be easily modified to suit practitioners' needs.

1. **Capacity, consent and electroconvulsive therapy: A qualitative and cross-sectional study**
Background: Mental capacity based mental health legislation has been proposed, but its potential impact on practice has not been described. Aims: To describe the extent to which mental capacity based **law** might change prescriptions of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in England and Wales. Method: A qualitative study using focus groups and semi-structured interviews of psychiatrists, was followed by a cross sectional study of 186 consultant psychiatrists. Results: Psychiatrists were divided in their management of detained but apparently competent patients refusing ECT. From the cross sectional survey, 15.9% reported having prescribed ECT in such patients, but some expressed views that the treatment was not acceptable under these circumstances. Conclusions: Mental capacity based legislation could limit the use of compulsory treatment to some individuals refusing treatment. However, it might equally lead to psychiatrists redefining their operational definitions of mental capacity. Declaration of interest: This study was funded by the Department of Health.

2. **Expanding our Reach: Telehealth and Licensure Implications for Psychologists**
This article discusses the background and history of the Association of State and Provincial Psychology Board's (ASPPB) Principles and Standards for Telepsychology. The Principles/Standards are described with comments on each one as they apply to the practice of telepsychology, and with a guide on how they coordinate with the American Psychological Association's Guidelines for the Practice of Telepsychology. Further, barriers to the interjurisdictional practice of telepsychology are reviewed and a proposed solution to them is presented. The ASPPB psychology interjurisdictional compact, known as the PSYPACT is in process of being introduced as an effective vehicle for addressing these barriers.  2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York. eid: 2-s2.0-84949535290
3. **The Intelligent e-Therapy system: A new paradigm for telepsychology and cybertherapy**
One of the main drawbacks of computer-assisted psychology tools developed up to now is related to the real time customisation and **adapt**ation of the content to each patient depending on his/her activity. In this paper we propose a new approach for mental e-health treatments named Intelligent e-Therapy (eIT) with capabilities for ambient intelligence and ubiquitous computing. From a technical point of view, an eIT **system** is based on four fundamental axes: ambient intelligence for capturing physiological, psychological and contextual information of the patient; persuasive computing for changing/reinforcing behaviours; ubiquitous computing for using **the sy**stem at any place, and at any time; and multiple technological platforms support.  2009 Taylor & Francis. eid: 2-s2.0-70449497700
4. **Informed consent to e-therapy**
E-therapy, the provision of mental health treatment through the Internet, poses many risks as well as benefits. This article addresses some **relev**ant risks and benefits of e-therapy and discusses the practicality of using computers in the **informed cons**ent process. Although e-therapy has numerous proponents, no clinical trials have assessed its long-term effectiveness. To limit liability and to protect patients, e-therapy providers should disclose material risks as well as possible benefits and engage patients in an active dialogue. A thoro**ugh informed ****consent** procedure enables patients to make an educated decision about whether e-therapy is **right** for them. In the future, e-ther**apy and infor****med con**sent online may become more common; in the mean time, clinicians must be prepared for e-therapy's uncertain legal status and allow patients to decide for themselves whether or not to seek counseling on the Internet. eid: 2-s2.0-33748347271
5. **Delivery of evidence-based psychotherapy via video telehealth**
There has been increasing interest in using video telehealth to deliver evidence-based psychotherapies (EBPs). Telehealth may have numerous advantages over standard in-person care, including decreasing patients' and providers' costs and increasing **system** coverage area. However, little is known regarding the effectiveness of EBPs via video telehealth. This review had two goals, including a review of the existing literature and ongoing research on using video telehealth technologies to deliver EBPs as well as an informal survey of telehealth experts to discuss the special considerations and challenges present in **adapt**ing practices to video telehealth. Together, findings suggest that telehealth practices could represent an important component of the future of psychotherapy and clinical practice, especially in dissemination and implementation of EBPs in traditionally underserved areas and populations.  2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York (outside the USA). eid: 2-s2.0-84888199158
6. **Evaluating Telehealth Websites for Information Consistent with APA Guidelines for Telepsychology**
The authors evaluated websites offering therapeutic telehealth services (N = 55) using a 38-item checklist based on the American Psychological Associations Guidelines for the Practice of Telepsychology (APA Guidelines) to determine the extent that online service providers included such information on their websites. On average, the websites reviewed addressed only 39% of the checklist criteria. These findings are disconcerting and suggest most providers websites do not include information that would help potential clients make informed decisions about online treatment.

0. **Resident Evaluation of a Required Telepsychiatry Clinical Experience**
Objective: The authors explored **resid**ent **experi**ences of telepsychiatry clinical training. This paper describes an analysis of evaluation forms completed by psychia**try r**esidents following a required train**ing ex**perience in telepsychiatry. Methods: Retrospective numeric and narrative data were collected from 2005 to 2012. Using a five-point Likert-type scale (1 = strongly disagree and 5 = strongly **agree**), residents ranked the session based on the following characteristics: the **overal**l experience, **interest** in participating in telepsychiatry in the future, understanding service provision to underserved areas, telepsychiatry as mode of service delivery, and the unique aspects of telepsychiatry work. The authors also conducted a content analysis of narrative comments in response to open-ended questions about the positive and negative aspects of t**he tra**ining experience. Results: In a**ll, 8**8 % of residents completed (n = 335) an anonymous evaluation following their participation in telepsychiatry consultation sessions. Numeric results were mostly positive and ind**icated** that the experience **was inte**resting and enjoyable, e**nhanced **interest in participating in telepsychiatry in the future, and increased understanding of providing psychiatric services to underserved communities. Narrative data demonstrated that the most valuable aspects of training included the knowledge acquired in terms of establishing rapport and engaging with patients, using the technology, working collaboratively, identifying different approaches used, and awareness of the compl**exity** of cases. Resident desire for more training of this nature was prevalent, specifically a wish for more detail, additional time for discussion and debriefing, and further explanation of the unique aspects of telepsychiatry as mode of delivery. Conclusions: More evaluation of telepsychiatry training, elective or required, is needed. The context of this training offered potential side benefits of learning about interprofessional and collaborative care for the underserved.  2015 Academic Psychiatry. eid: 2-s2.0-84959335862
1. **Psychologist and Physician Interest in Telehealth Training and Referral for Mental Health Services: An Exploratory Study**
The current study explored psychological and medical professionals' **interest** in videoconferencing telehealth training and mental health telehealth referral. An online survey assessed 782 participants comprised of 669 psychological (45% male, Mean Age = 47.01, SD = 16.82) and 113 medical professionals (58% male, Mean Age = 46.19, SD = 12.40). Z-test analyses indicated that although psychological professionals were statistically m**ore inte**rested in receiving telehealth training, both groups report**ed some **interest. Ranked responses indicated efficacy data, ethical issues, and legal concerns as the most endorsed areas **of train**ing interest. Referral concerns were also found. Findings were discussed related to both statistical and clinical significance. Application of findings is discussed related to future work, practice, and program creation. The development of telehealth training progra**ms will **provide interested professionals with tools required for practice and may serve as an impetus to increase utilization and/or referral.  2014 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. eid: 2-s2.0-84905711312
2. **Telemedicine interest for routine follow-up care among neurology patients in Arkansas**
Background: Teleneurology in Arkansas has been used primarily for management of acute stroke with a state-funded hub-and-spoke model allowing physicians at rural hospitals to access vascular neurologists in time to facilitate tissue plasminogen activator **administr**ation. Routine neurologic care has been provided only in small pilot studies. We wished to determine patient **interest** in participating in teleneurology for routine follow-up visits as well as demographic and medical factors associated w**ith inte**rest. Materials and Methods: New and established patients of the Neurology Outpatient Clinic at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) were surveyed between March 2011 and December 2012 to asses**s their **interest in participating in teleneurology as well as potential factors associated** with th**eir interest. Results: Of 1,441 responde**nts, 52.**4% were interested in tel**emedicin**e. Of th**ose inte**rested versus uninterested in telemedicine, respectively, 68.9% versus 36.32% traveled more than 1 h to the clinic, 64.7% versus 35.3% had difficulty secondary to neurological conditions, 22.6% versus 6.8% had missed medical appointments due to travel problems, and 43.1% versus 9.4% had travel-imposed financial hardship**. Conclu**sions: Telemedicine interest for routine follow-up visits was strong among patients at the UAMS Neurology Outpatient Clinic. Fac**tors pos**itively associated with interest included long travel distances, travel expenses, and transportation difficulties. These results suggest that implementing a telemedicine program for follow-up visits would be acceptable to neurology patients for routine ongoing care.

3. **Connecting to the future: Telepsychiatry in postgraduate medical education**
Objective: This study characterized and examined factors influencing psychiatry **resid**ents' and fellows' **interest**, **exposur**e, and future plans to use telepsychiatry. Subjects and Methods: A 17-item electronic survey was distributed to 485 psychia**try r**esidency and fellowship programs in the United States. Each program director or **administr**ator was asked to voluntarily distribute the survey to his or her trainees. Chi-squared tests were performed to test differences in proportions. Stepwise multivariate logistic regression was used to model outcomes** of inte**rest. Results: In total, 283 respondents completed the survey. A majority of responden**ts were **interested in telepsychiatry and felt that it was an important part of training. Of the 50 respondents who had clini**cal exp**osure to telepsychiatry and completed the survey, most reported that their **experi**ence incr**eased th**eir interest level, and two-thirds reported having either a one-time encounter or less than 6 h of multiple pati**ent ex**periences via telepsychiatry. C**linical** exposure to telepsychiatry was significantly related to level of training (p=0.001) and program **locat**ion (p=**0.005**). Residents in their **postgradu**ate year (PGY) 4 or fellowship were 2.6 times more likely to be exposed to clinical telepsychiatry t**han P**GY 1-3 residents (95% confidence interval [**CI] 1**.41-4.95). Residents and fellows in rural programs were 4.3 times more likely to be exposed than those in urban or suburban settings (95% CI 1.07-17.28). Factors affecting trainees' plans to use telepsychiatry in their future practice include prog**ram l**ocatio**n (p=0.0**13) and intere**st le**vel (p<0.001). Residents and fellows i**n rur**al locations were 9.3 times more likely to report future plans to use telepsychiatry (95% CI 1.88-45.71). Conclusions: There is a p**racti**ce g**ap betw**e**en** resident interest a**nd resi**dent exposure to telepsychiatry. Training programs should consider incorporating a brief telepsychiatry** expe**rience t**o fulfil**l both resident interest and the growing demand for psychiatrists.  2013, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-84896551051
4. **Choosing psychiatry as a career: Motivators and deterrents at a critical decision-making juncture**
Objective: To examine factors influencing the choice of psychiatry as a career between **resid**ency program application and ranking decision making. Methods: Using an online questionnaire, applicants to the largest Canadian psychia**try r**esidency program were surveyed about the impact of various factors on their ultimate decision to enter psy**chiat**ry residency training. Results: Applicants reported that patient-related stigma was a motivator in considering psychiatry as a career, but that negative comments from colleagues, friends, and family about choosing psychiatry was a deterrent. Training program length, limited treatments, and insufficient clerkship **exposur**e were noted as deterrents to choosing psychiatry, though future job prospects, the growing role of neuroscience, and diagnostic **complex**ity positively influenced choosing psychiatry as a specialty. Research and elective time away opportunities were deemed relatively unimportant to ranking decisions, compared with more highly weighted factors, such as program flexibility, emphasis on psychotherapy, service-training balance, and training program **locat**ion. Most applicants also reported continuing to fine tune ranking decisions between the application and ranking submission deadline. Conclusions: Stig**ma, exp**osure to psychiatry, diagnos**tic com**plexity, and an encouraging job market were highlighted as positive influences on the choice to enter** psyc**hiatry residency. Interview and information days represent opportunities for continued targeted recruitment activity** for **psychiatry residency programs. eid: 2-s2.0-84905994899
5. **Defining competencies for the practice of telepsychiatry through an assessment of resident learning needs Approaches to teaching and learning**
Background: A foundational assessment of learning needs is missing from previous reports of telepsychiatry curricula. We used an in-depth needs assessment to identify specific skills required for the practice of effective telepsychiatry, and provide an evidence base to guide the development of telepsychiatry curricula in **postgradu**ate psychiatry training. Many of these skills set telepsychiatry apart from practice in traditional face-to-face clinical settings, or result from adaptations to clinical practice to meet the needs of a telepsychiatry interface in patient care. Methods: We used a qualitative, modified grounded theory approach to gain insight into areas of importance for telepsychiatry training** in postg**raduate psychiatry **resid**ency. 16 interviews of faculty **and r**esidents (9 and 7 interviews, respectively), allowed participants to reflect on their **experi**ences in telepsychiatry. Data were then thematically analyzed. Results: Interview respondents identified important aspects of the context for telepsychiatry training; the skills required to competently practice telepsychiatry; and the desired teaching and learning methods for acquiring these skills. Specific domains of competency were identified: Technical skills; assessment skills; relational skills and communication; collaborative and interprofessional skills; **administr**ative skills; medico-legal skills; community psychiatry and community-specific knowledge; cultural psychiatry skills, including knowledge of Indigenous cultures; and, knowledge of health systems. The skills identified in this study map well to competency- based **medical educ**ation frameworks. Conclusions: Telepsychiatry is increasingly being adopted as a solution to health systems problems such as regional disparities in access to care, and it requires explicit competency development. Ensuring adequate and quality **exposur**e to telepsychiatry** duri**ng residency training could positively impact our health systems and health equity.  2016 Crawford et al. eid: 2-s2.0-84956888493

0. **Practical issues in delivery of clinician-to-patient telemental health in an academic medical center**
Background: In the **age** of online communication, psychiatric care can now be provided via videoconferencing technologies. While **virtual** visits as a part of telepsychiatry and **telemental health** provide a highly efficient and beneficial modality of care, the implementation** of vir**tual visits requires attention to quality and safety issues. As practitioners continue to utilize this technology, issues of clinician licensing, treatment outc**omes of** virtual visits versus in-person visits, and **cost** offset require ongoing study. Methods: This review provides an overview of the topics of technology, **legal** and regulatory issues, clinical issues, **and **cost savings as they relate to practicing psychiatry and psy**chology** via virtual visits in an academic medical center. We review the telepsychia**try/telemental he**alth effectiveness **literatur**e from 2013 to the present. **Our liter**ature searches used the following** terms: telementa**l health effective, telepsychiatry effective, telepsychiatry ef**ficacy, and telem**ental health efficacy. These searches produced 58 articles, reduced to 16 when including only articles that address effectiveness of clinician-to-patient services. Results: The technologic**al, l**egal, and regulatory issues vary from state to state and over time. The emerging research addressing diverse populations and disorders provides strong evidence for the effectiveness of telepsyc**hiat**ry. Cost savings are difficult to precisely **determin**e and depend on the s**cope** of the cost and benefit measured. Conclusion: Establishing a telepsychiatry program requires a comprehensive approach with up-**to-da**te legal and technological considerations.  2017 President and Fellows of Harvard College. eid: 2-s2.0-85020433122
1. **Telemental Health: Digital Disruption and the Opportunity to Expand Care**
**Telemental health**, which involves clinicians connecting remotely to patients via teleconferencing, has seen growing interest. In addition to providing in-home treatment, this technology allows specialists to provide care in remote and underserved areas. Current research suggests that both patients and clinicians are satisfied with tele**mental health servic**es and that it is **compar**able in terms of quality to in-person care. Nonetheless, concerns still exist regarding its effects on the role of clinicians and the care they provide.  2016,  The Author(s) 2016. eid: 2-s2.0-84959422131
2. **The effectiveness of telemental health: A 2013 review**
Introduction: The effectiveness of any new technology is typically measured in order to **determin**e whether it successfully achieves equal or superior objectives over what is currently offered. Research in **telemental health** - in this article mainly referring to telepsychiatry and psychological services - has advanced rapidly since 2003, and a new effectiveness review is needed. Materials and Methods: The authors reviewed the published **literatur**e to synthesize information on what is and what is not effective related** to telemental he**alth. Terms for the search included, but were not limited to, telepsychiatry, effectiveness, mental health, e-health, videoconferencing, telemedicine, **cost**, access, and international. R**esults: Telementa**l health is effective for diagnosis and assessment across many populations (adult, child, geriatric, and ethnic) and for disorders in many settings (emergency, home health) and appears to be **compar**able to in-person care. In addition, this review has identified new models of care (i.e., collaborative care, asynchronous, mobile) with equally positive outcomes. C**onclusions: Telem**ental health is effective and increases access to care. Future directions suggest the need for more research on service models, specific disorders, the issues relevant to culture and langu**age**, **and **cost.  2013, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-84896551334

0. **Using telepsychiatry to enrich existing integrated primary care**
Background: Integrated care is characterized by evolving heterogeneity in models. Using telepsychiatry to enhance these models can increase access, quality, and efficiencies in care. **Introduct**ion: The **purpos**e of this **report** is to describe the process and **outcom**es of adapting telepsychiatry into an existing integrated care service. Materials and Methods: Telepsychiatry was implemented into an existing integrated care model in a high-volume, **urban**, primary care clinic in Colorado serving patients with complex physical and **behavior**al needs. Consultative, direct care, educational/training encounters, provider-to-provider communication, process changes, and patient-level **descript**ive measures were tracked as part of ongoing quality improvement. Results: Telepsychiatry was adapted into the exist**ing beha**vioral health services using an iterative team meeting process within a stepped care model. Over 35% of the requests for psychiatry services were medication related-and medication changes (type/dose) were the most frequent refer**ral ou**tcome of psychiatric consultation. Forty percent of patients in the service had m**ultiple **behavioral health diagnoses, in addition to physical health diagnoses. Discussion: Telehealth will become an increasingly necessary component in building hybrid/blended integrated care teams. Examples of flexible model implementation will support clinics in tailoring effective applications for their unique patient panels. Conclusions: An adapted integrated care model leveraging telepsychiatry is successfully serving the complex deep end of a primary care patient population in Colorado. Lessons learned in implementing this model include the importance of team attitudes.  2019, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-85071183030
1. **An analysis of telepsychiatry programs from an organizational perspective**
Employing telecommunication tools to deliver **behavior**al health services over a **distanc**e, referred to as telepsychiatry, is a **techniqu**e that has been around since the 1950s. With more than 40 formally recognized active telepsychiatry programs, ample published studies have documented the technical feasibility and apparent satisfaction and acceptance by patients and providers. However, there has been **minim**al analysis regarding the formal programs delivering these services. This study collected data from 16 programs recognized as among the most active in the world. The results indicate a dearth of strategic business plans for the provision of telepsychiatry services; a focus on patient services above all and; the potential for telepsychiatry to eventually meld into the everyday practice of psychiatrists and psychologists. eid: 2-s2.0-0034527826
2. **Evaluation of Telepsychiatry-Enabled Perinatal Integrated Care**
OBJECTIVE: The **purpos**e of this article is to describe the implementation of the first known telepsychiatry-enabled model of perinatal integrated care and to **report** initial results following implementation. METHODS: **Behavior**al health screening data were collected from 712 patients at an **urban** women's clinic, and a more in-depth set of process and **outcom**e measures, including treatment engagement, services utilized, and delivery and postpartum pati**ent ou**tcomes, was collected from 135 patients referred **for beha**vioral health services. Using nationally published metrics to provide context, the authors applied a **descript**ive design to evaluate and conduct analyses of **progra**m outcomes. RESULTS: The telehealth-enabled integrated care model was successfully implemented within a specialty obstetrics practice. Identification and treat**ment of **behavioral health issues exceeded nationally published rates. The model was also associated with positive indices related to birth weight and br**eastfeed**ing behavior. CONCLUSIONS: These initial results point to telepsychiatry as an effective tool for expanding perinatal integrated care and lay the foundation for further study and model refinement. The results also add to the growing body of evidence for the use of telepsychiatry-supported integrated care across diverse clinical settings and patient populations. eid: 2-s2.0-85084175503

1. **Enchantment in psychiatric medicine**
Max Weber's 1918 essay Science as a Vocation posits that increasing scientific knowledge has contributed to a disenchantment of the **natur**al world. His argument has implications for medicine, an applied science aimed at the improvement of health, including psychiatric medicine. Using Weber's argument, this **paper** **discuss**es the ambivalent relationship psychiatry has with technology. On one hand, based on the historical roots of the specialty and the influence of psychodynamic psychotherapy, psychiatrists believe themselves to be masters of the invisible space between physicians and their patients. They claim to have the skills and insight that enable them to establish a unique kind of relationship in which communication not only allows them to diagnose, but also to heal through a variety of psychotherapeutic techniques. As a result, many psychiatrists are wary of the introduction of technology into therapeutic setting and the potential for this type of communication to be disrupted or diminished in value, often basing their concern on the ways in which technology has been witnessed to be disenchanting in other medical specialties. On the other hand, others see the future practice of psychiatry best guided through whole-hearted embrace of brain-based medical technology, which has been stunted by the complexity of the brain and relative lack of research funding compared to other medical specialties. T**his dis**cussion within the **field** is timely, as on the horizon lies the holy grail of technological advancement for psychiatric practice: definitive biomarkers to diagnose mental illness and provide individualized treatments.  2019 Elsevier B.V. eid: 2-s2.0-85073722642

3. **Digitising psychiatry? Sociotechnical expectations, performative nominalism and biomedical virtue in (digital) psychiatric praxis**
Digital artefacts and infrastructures have been presented as ever more urgent and necessary for mental health research and practice. Telepsychiatry, **mHealth**, and now digital psychiatry have been promoted in this regard, among other endeavours. Smartphone apps have formed a particular focus of promissory statements regarding the improvement of epistemic and clinical work in psychiatry. This article contextualises and historicises some of these developments. In doing so, I show how purportedly novel **field**s have been constituted in part through practices of performative nominalism (whereby articulations of a neologism in relation to established and recent developments participate in producing the referent of the new term). Central to this has been implicit and explicit extolment of what I term biomedical virtues in public-facing and professionally orientated discourse. I document how emphases on various virtues have shifted with the attention of psychiatry to different digital modalities, culminating with knowledge-production in mental health as one significant focus.  2018 The Author.

4. **A consolidated model for telepsychology practice**
Objective: In this **paper**, we identify available telepsychology guidelines, understand similarities and differences, and organize the contents into a model of core practice domains pertinent to a variety of applications of telepsychology practice. Method: A scoping review of **current** telepsychology guidelines was conducted to identify, organize, and distill available telepsychology guidelines (Arksey & O'Malley, 2005, Int J Soc Res Methodol, 8, 1932). Results: We identified overlap among five sets of telepsychology guideli**nes cur**rently available and presented a consolidated model including nine practice domains influenced by practice setting and modality. Conclusions: Telepsychology has the potential to **address** current issues in availability, accessibility, acceptability, anonymity, and affordability of mental health services but establishing or engaging in telepsychology practice has been daunting for many practitioners. Telepsychologists can disseminate applications of this model in different settings and with different modalities and this practice model can inform future development of competencies.  2020 The Authors.

6. **Path analytic modeling of psychologists openness to performing clinical work with telepsychology: A national study**
Objective: To examine whether the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) and Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) apply to psychologists openness to using telepsychology. Method: Participants were 1,791 psychologists **current**ly practicing psychotherapy. Participants represented all 50 US states and averaged 26.33 (SD = 11.18) years in clinical practice. The study used a cross-sectional, national online design. Results: Path analyses derived from the TRA and TAM evidenced poor fit. A newly-developed, third model achieved adequate to fit in which perceived attitudes of others concerning telepsychology were associated with perceived ease of use ( = 0.25, p <.001) and usefulness ( = 0.30, p <.001) of telepsychology. Perceived ease of use ( = 0.30, p <.001) and usefulness ( = 0.32, p <.001) of telepsychology both uniquely predic**ted cur**rent use of telepsychology.

8. **Prospective acceptance of distinct mobile mental health features in psychiatric patients and mental health professionals**
Background: Despite numerous mobile health (**mHealth**) applications available, **current** impact on mental healthcare is low. Users face overwhelming variety of applications and sensors. Evidence for distinct features' effectiveness is largely lacking. Along with technical feasibility and data security issues, readiness and preferences of patients predetermine engagement and impact** of mHe**alth in psychiatry. Objective: We aimed to assess the prospective attitudes of psychiatric patients and mental health professionals (MHP) **towards** mHealth applications in **gener**al and with regard to distinct features. Methods: We conducted a survey entailing 486 subjects (297 MHP and 189 patients). Results: Professionals and patients indicate both, considerable acceptance and rejection for most features. Marked concerns across groups relate to data security** in g**eneral. Actimetry and geotracking were considered particularly skeptical. Importantly, most patients prefer to be prompted timely about health status changes. Conclusion: Altogether, evidence indicates substantial **support** for mHealth features in mental healthcare despite considerable rejection of distinct features. We conclude that tighter collaboration between researchers, developers and clinicians must a**ddress **matching mHealth-apps to patients' needs. Improved information on potential risks and possibilit**ies ass**ociated with mHealth features is strongly indicated in MHP and psychiatric patients in order to reach an appropriately informed decision on individual involvement.  2018 Elsevier Ltd eid: 2-s2.0-85059267634
9. **How psychological telehealth can alleviate society's mental health Burden: A literature review**
Mental health professionals must establish new means to reach those in need that face obstacles related to geographical location, time limitations, and health. With the high incidence of mental illness, as well as the hypothesized increase in coming years, telehealth modalities propose a novel and far-reaching alternative to traditional therapy. This article outlines the positive aspects and interdisciplinary possibilities when telehealth is incorporated into mental health practice. Novel outlets including **mHealth** and the utilization of computer tablets as mental health facilitators are outlined. Considerations for practice including training are **discuss**ed, as well as potential future directions for the **field**. Available data supports telehealth as an effective mode for the treatment of clients who are unable to pursue mental health services in their **current** form. However, careful consideration and training for the mental health professional is needed if telehealth is to be effectively used to alleviate the mental health burden.

Objectives: The **current** study explored differences in acceptance of telehealth interventions amon**gst cur**rently licensed and future clinicians with a focus on web camera-based intervention. The influence of theoretical orientation was also assessed. Method: An online survey assessed 717 participants comprising 409 licensed psychologists (40.8% female, mean age = 56.57, standard deviation [SD] = 11.01) and 308 doctoral-level students (78.9% female, mean age = 27.66, SD = 5.9) across domains of endorsement and rejection. Results: Binary logistic regression indicated no significant difference **between** currently licensed and future psychologists in their endorsement of telehealth modalities. Cognitive-behavioral, cognitive, behavioral, and systems psychologists were significantly more accepting of telehealth interventions than were dynamic/analytic or existential therapists. Conclusions: Increasing exposure to telehealth through education as well as continued research on efficacy for specific diagnoses may **help** psychologists to more effectively determine whether telehealth is the "best fit" for both clinician and client.  2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-84870919311
11. **From Digital Mental Health Interventions to Digital Addiction: Where the Two Fields Converge**
Scientific **literatur**e from the last two decades indicates that, when it comes to mental health, technology is presented either as panacea or anathema. This is partly because researchers, too frequently, have planted themselves either in the **field** of digital mental health interventions (variably called telepsychiatry, digital therapeutics, computerized therapy, etc.), or in that of the problems arising from technology, with little cross-fertilization between the two. Yet, a closer look at the **two f**ields reveals unifying themes that underpin both the advantages and dangers of technology in mental health. This article **discuss**es five such themes. First, the breakneck pace of technology evolution keeps digital mental health interventions updated and creates more potentially problematic activities, leaving researchers perennially behind, so new technologies become outdated by the time they are studied. Second, the freedom of creating and using technologies in a regulatory vacuum has led to proliferation and choice, but also to a Wild-West online environment. Third, technology is an open window to access information, but also to compromise privacy, with serious implications for online psychology and digital mental health interventions. Fourth, weak bonds characterize online interactions, including those between therapists and patients, contributing to high attrition from digital interventions. Finally, economic analyses of technology-enabled care may show good value for money, but often fail to capture the true costs of technology, a fact that is mirrored in other online activities. The article ends with a call for collaborations between two inter**relat**ed fields that have beentill nowmutually insular.  Copyright  2020 Aboujaoude and Gega. eid: 2-s2.0-85079160741

Objective: To explore the benefits and problems with the use of e-mail as an **adjunct** to face-to-face cognitive behavioural psychotherapy for patients with **chronic** psychiatric disorders. Methods: The study involved 4 patients (2 men and 2 women, aged 21-31) with a history** of chr**onic psychiatric disorders. All patients met diagnostic criteria for **variou**s combinations of **affect**ive disorders and anxiety disorders and all met the criteria for social phobia. Two patients also suffered from one or more **person**ality disorders. Patients initially received face-to-face treatment after which e-mail was added as** an adj**unct treatment modality. Results: The results of the study demonstrated that e-mail can be an effective supplement to face-to-face therapy for patients with complex psychiatric disorders. E-mail may be used in different ways, and these can be varied depending on the specific needs of each patient. The particulars of how the use of e-mail functioned in each of the cases are discussed. Conclusions: E-mail may contribute positively to therapy especially for patients that express an **interest** in the use of this **type** of technology and those that have problems concentrating, expressing themselves verbally, or have **high** levels of anxiety in face-to-face settings. A good working alliance should always be established prior to the introduction of e-mail in therapy, in order to reduce the chance of misunderstanding occurring.

1. **The use of telepsychology in clinical practice: Benefts, effectiveness, and issues to consider**
The use of **variou**s technologies in the practice of psychology has increased greatly in recent years in concert with increases in the use of these technologies in the lives of most individuals. E-mail, text messaging, chat rooms, and the Internet have greatly changed how many individuals communicate and maintain relationships. The psychotherapy relationship is no exception. The scope and practice of telepsychology, the use of the Internet and other technologies in the provision of psychological services, is reviewed along with relevant research that supports their use in the treatment of a wide range of conditions and disorders. Clinical, ethical, and legal issues and challenges are addressed and recommendations for the effective and appropriate use of these technologies in psychological practice are provided.

2. **Special online consulting for patients with eating disorders and their relatives: Analysis of user characteristics and e-mail content**
In the treatment of **chronic** diseases, programs that use the internet as a medium are becoming more and more important as a complement to classical intervention techniques. Since 1998, a non-profit information and online consulting service for patients with eating disorders and their friends and relatives (www.ab-server.de) has existed. This was established by members of the Deutsche Forschungsinitiative Essstrungen e.V. (DFE) [German Research Initiative for Eating Disorders] and members of the Clinic of Psychiatry, University of Leipzig, Germany. For the present study, 2,176 e-mail requests from users of the online consultation service were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively in order to better understand the differences between different **type**s and groups of users. The analysis was related to the social field of the **person** requesting the consultation, **the **type of disorder reported, and the content of the e-mail request. Three main user groups could be identified: people who described themselves as having an eating disorder (57.2%), people who were related socially to the **affect****ed pe**rson (32.4%), and int**ereste**d persons (9.8%). The consulting service was predominan**tly us**ed by persons suffering from bulimia nervosa or their families and friends (63.1%). One third (33.3%) of the posted e-mails were related to behavioral patterns in dealing with the illness and ****the a**f**fected person. They were followed by inquiries for information about the disease (18.7%) and by those seeking help in finding specialized clinics/therapists and places in therapies. The increasing use of the online consulting service indicates that there is a substantial need for info**rmatio**n and help in persons with eating disorders and in their relatives, who are able to easily **contact** professionals using this online service. Online consulting has a **high** potential for complementary **care o**f affected people.  Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-33847724788
3. **E-mail therapy for anorexia nervosa: Prospects and limitations**
Demographic and clinical characteristics indicate **high** acceptance of e-mail by outpatients with anorexia nervosa. Patients report that frequent e-mail **contact** provides them with the experience of grea**ter con**tact with their clinicians and requires them to be more attentive to therapeutic tasks. Routine logs of calorie counts and symptoms may be communicated by e-mail on a frequent basis, freeing up office time for better discussions. Informal investigations in a case series of outpatients with anorexia nervosa suggest that e-mail can offer a useful **adjunct** to treatment. No adverse consequences have been experienced. Clinicians using e-mail in this fashion must attend to legal and ethical concerns about e-mail communication.

Telepsychology is having a profound **influenc**e on **profession**al practice. Currently, however, many psychologists lack the requisite knowledge and skill to provide **ethic**al and **compet**ent telepractice services. Moreover, the **field** has lagged in developing the educational and supervised experiences required to achi**eve co**mpetency. Yet, there is great opportunity as well. The purpose of this article is to identify the natural integration of the pillars of counseling psychology with the major domains of telepractice and to link telepractice to the values and mission of counseling psychologists. We present aspects of telepsychology includ**ing e**thical and legal factors, asynchronous and synchronous practice, and group-focused practice along with technologies and the rules that govern them. We also describe interjurisdictional practice, and introduce a proposed curriculum based upon the be**nchmar**k competencies for infusion of telepsychology into training across **the profes**sional lifespan.

1. **Online counseling: An exploratory survey of Italian psychologists attitudes towards new ways of interaction**
Objective: Online counseling may be defined as an interaction between users and mental health **profession**als that takes place through computer mediated communication technology. This study aimed to investigate the attitudes of Italian psychologists towards different aspects of online counseling provided via email, chat, forums, and videoconference. Method: An online questionnaire was administered to a sample of 289 licensed psychologists in the Veneto Region (Italy) in **order** to collect opinions, preferences, and intentions to use online modalities, along with prior knowledge and practice experiences. Results: Only 18.3% of the respondents had previous experience with online counseling. Overall, the majority of psychologists (62.6%) were favorable towards online counseling, but they also had several reservations about the provision of online diagnosis and **therapeut**ic interventions. Results showed a consistent lack of clarity regarding **ethic**al and penal issues concerning online modalities. Conclusions: More efforts must be directed to deepening the application of new technologies in the **field** of psychology** in o**rder to enable** an e**thical **and profes**sional practice of online counseling in Italy.  2017,  2017 Society for Psychotherapy Research. eid: 2-s2.0-85009200750
2. **Divided by miles, connected by purpose: Telepsychology technology in a graduate training program**
The use of telepsychology technology to deliver psychological services to geographically dispersed and isolated populations is on the rise. The increasing use of technology has not necessarily been accompanied by an enhancement in technology instruction by psychology training programs. A model of doctoral training is offered that integrates telepsychology technology throughout its curriculum, training, and program administration. Results from an evaluation of the acceptability and perceived effectiveness of the model in a graduate training program is presented along with recommendations for telepsychology training in **profession**al psychology.  2013 American Psychological Association. eid: 2-s2.0-84882660488
3. **Toward uniform competency standards in telepsychology: A proposed framework for canadian psychologists**
As Canadian psychologists increasingly incorporate Internet-based technologies into their practice, they are reminded that telepsychology-the application of technologies for the delivery of distance psychological services-requires special skills, knowledge, and judgment that extend beyond the core requirements of **profession**al practice. However, what constitutes **compet**ence in both face-to-face and telepsychology practice is still evolving in Canada. This article explores how the existing framework for Canadian psycholog**ist co**mpetence found in the Mutual Recognition Agreement of the Regulatory Bodies **for Profes**sional Psychologists in Canada (Council of Provincial Associations of Psychologists, 2001/ 2004), along with current research and other supporting documents in distance mental health, may serve as a useful foundation for the development of uniform telepsy**cholog**y competency standards across Canada.  2014 Canadian Psychological Association. eid: 2-s2.0-84925584626
4. **Ethical Practice in Telepsychology**
Objective: Telepsychology has the potential to revolutionise the provision of psychological service not only to those in remote locations, or with mobility issues, but also for those who prefer flexible access to services. Rapid developments in internet communications technology have yielded new and diverse methods of telepsychology. As a result, **ethic**al regulatory and advisory guidelines for practice have often been developed and disseminated reactively. This article investigates how the c**ore e**thical principles of **confidenti**ally, consent and **compet**ence are challenged in telepsychological practice. Method: Through the application of e**xisti**ng ethical standards, advances in communications technology are considere**d and** their ethical use in psychological contexts explored. Conclusion: It is expected that psychologists will have ba**sic co**mpetencies for the use of everyday technology in their practice. However, the use of internet communications technology for telepsychology has created new opportunities and** chal**lenges for ethical practice. For example, telepsychology is geographically flexible, but there can be privacy concerns in cross-b**order** information flow. Psychologists who engage in telepsychology require a particularly thorough understanding of concepts such as data mining, **electron**ic storage, and internet infrastructure.

5. **Telepsychiatry and the meaning of in-person contact: a preliminary ethical appraisal.**
Pioneering researchers claim that telepsychiatry presents the possibility of improving both the quality and quantity of patient care for populations in general as well as for those in rural and remote locations. The prevalence of, and literature on telepsychiatry has increased dramatically in the last decade, covering all aspects of research endeavors. However, little can be found on the topic of **ethic**s in telepsychiatry. Using various clinical scenarios we may provide insight into the moral challenge in telepsychiatry-the lack of in-person contact. The difficulty is to articulate what the significance of in-person contact is and further, its meaning in the **therapeut**ic relationship between the patient and the physician. Using the personalist perspective and related philosophical approaches we may sketch an idea of the patient as person, existentially considered as a relational and bodily human being. By applying Brennan's model for health technology assessment we may evaluate the morally troubling aspect of telepsychiatry-a lack of in-person contact-on this philosophical sketch of the person. This consideration is crucial when developing policies to guide the use of telepsychiatry in **order** to maintain the quality of care. eid: 2-s2.0-77953010070
6. **Security management in telepsychology**
Psychologists increasingly rely upon " telepsychology" (e.g., e-mail and Internet-based client communications) despite the growing presence of threats to online security. However, practitioners may overestimate the benefits of **electron**ic communications and underestimate their risks. Using the example of the availability heuristic as one cognitive bias, which may promote this imbalance, this article reviews a number of resources for practitioners that provide enhanced security and **confidenti**ality in the digital realm. Governmental, regulatory and **profession**al bodies provide pertinent and detailed guidance that can achieve these goals. To illustrate this process, this article reviews and augments a number of safeguards (administrative, physical, and technical) within the HIPAA Security Rule. It also surveys opportunities for continuing education and credentialing that may enha**nce profes**sional **compet**ence** in elec**tronic communications. It concludes with a list of recommendations for enhancing security and reducing the **influenc**e of the availability heuristic in telepsychology. These recommendations range across several catego**ries of pr**ofessional practice: hardware and software manageme**nt, confid**entiality, informed conse**nt, co**mpetence, consultation, and continuing education. This article can help practitioners reap the benefits of telepsychology while successfully en**hancing co**nfidentiality and security.  2011 American Psychological Association. eid: 2-s2.0-83755163154
7. **Therapeutic boundaries in telepsychology: Unique issues and best practice recommendations**
Technology-assisted mental health services are becoming much more routinely utilized by clients and practitioners alike. Clinicians practicing telepsychology must prepare themselves in **order** to provide **compet**ent care in this ever-evolving context of service delivery. Although much has been written with regards to considerations of **ethic**al and legal practice, practical and logistical guidelines, and the advantages and disadvantages of the delivery of services via the use of technology, little to no attention has been paid to issues related to **therapeut**ic boundaries in the telepsychology relationship. Clinicians must consider how to maintain appropriate boundaries in telepsychology settings** in o**rder to prevent harm and optimize treatment gains. Such considerations are also necessary given that it is probable that the telepsychology clinician will encounter novel boundary issues that are unlikely to occur in the traditional face-to-face therapy setting. We discuss the clinical utility of boundaries, potential boundary issues in telepsychology settings, and suggested best practice recommendations to ens**ure co**mpete**nt, e**thical, and efficacious treatment in this novel context of service delivery.  2014 American Psychological Association. eid: 2-s2.0-84925672075
8. **Cybertherapy: Advantages, limitations, and ethical issues**
Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) are becoming more and more common in Clinical Psychology. Two of the technologies that are more consolidated in this **field** are virtual reality (VR) and telepsychology. There are other technological innovations that are beginning to be used in clinical and health psychology such as ambient intelligence, ubiquitous computing or persuasive computing. In the last fifteen years there has been a proliferation of studies testing the efficacy of immersive virtual reality in the delivery of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for several mental dis**order**s and health conditions. The essence of VR is that it can simulate reality and add a new possibility: the user has the illusion of "being" in the computer-generated environment while interacting with the VR objects. This unique feature of VR is very relevant for its use in Clinical Psychology. At the same time, it can raise several **ethic**al issues. It is important to investigate the possible effects of blurring the distinction between real and virtual worlds in vulnerable populations. Some other concerns regarding the use of VR in therapy have already been investigated, such as cybersickness. After ten years of experience treating patients with VR, this has not been a problem in the published efficacy studies. Telepsychology has also been used to improve the delivery of CBT. A number of Internetdelivered programs have already become important tools in the health system. The main advantage is that online therapy can reach people who might not otherwise seek therapy, such as disabled people or those who live in remote areas. However, several concerns have been raised about self-help procedures, like the issue of self-diagnosis. and the fact that patients usually have all of the necessary self-help information at their disposal. It is important to establish criteria to protect people from the possible negative effects of this. Other innovations such as ambient intelligence and pervasive computing bring up ot**her e**thical issues. For example, is privacy being compromised too much when people are located using GPS or physiologically monitored 24 hours a day? Criteria for considering these issues must be established. Our research group has been working with new technologies and therapies for the last fifteen years. This paper addres**ses t**he ethical issues we have encountered in our research and clinical practice; it al**so ex**plores ethical issues that will become increasingly important. eid: 2-s2.0-77952896145
9. **Twenty-First Century Ethical Challenges for Psychology**
Foreseeable social and technological changes will force us to reevaluate our thinking about **ethic**ally appropriate ways to fulfill our mission of using psychology to advance human health and welfare in the twenty-first century. Three categories of challenge related to societal and technological changes have become particularly evident. First, increasing patterns of delivering services over substantial distances by **electron**ic means (i.e., telepsychology) demand consideration. Second, we must parse **our e**thical obligations to individuals, to groups, and to society at large as our **influenc**e working behind the scenes as "invisible" psychologists grows. Finally, as we witness the accelerating demise of psychiatry, we must take care not to follow a similar path. As we f**ace n**ew ethical challenges, we must continually ask ourselves where our responsibilities lie as individuals and as a **profession**. We must learn not to repeat the mistakes of the past and focus instead on optimizing the future for a science and practice of psychology focused on human health and welfare.  2007 American Psychological Association. eid: 2-s2.0-34548642366

0. **A model for digital mental healthcare: Its usefulness and potential for service delivery in low- and middle-income countries**
Background: Using digital technology to deliver mental health care can possibly serve as a viable adjunct or alternative to mainstream services in lessening the mental health gap in a large number of resource deficient and LAMI countries. Conventional models of telepsychiatric services available so far, however, have been inadequate and ineffective, as these address only a small component of care, and rely on engagement of specialists who are grossly insufficient in numbers. Aim: To describe an innovative digital model of mental health care, enabling and empowering the non-specialists to deliver high quality mental health care in **remot**e areas. Methods: The model is powered by an online, fully automated clinical decision support **system** (CDSS), with interlinked modules for diagnosis, management and follow-up, usable by non-specialists after brief training and minimal supervision by psychiatrist, to deliver mental health care** at r**emote sites. Results: The CDSS has been found to be highly reliable, feasible, with sufficient sensitivity and specificity. This paper describes the model and **initi**al experience with the digital mental health c**are sy**stem deployed in three geographically diffic**ult a**nd remote areas in northern hill states in India. The** onlin**e system was found to be reasonably comprehensive, brief, feasible, user-friendly, with high levels of patient satisfaction. 2594 patients assessed a**t the** three remote sites and the nodal center represented varied diagnoses. Conclusions: The digital model described here has the potential to serve as an effective alternative or adjunct for delivering comprehensive and high quality mental health care in LAMI countries like India in the primary and secondary care settings.  2019 Indian Journal of Psychiatry. eid: 2-s2.0-85059851863

2. **Demographic and psychiatric predictors of engagement in psychotherapy services conducted via clinical video telehealth**
Introduction: Military veterans are at high risk for **develop**ing mental health problems. Unfortunately, veterans have relatively low rates of engagement in **mental health servic**es compared with non-veterans. In order to address barriers to mental health care services, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) has implemented clinical video telehealth (CVT). Although the effectiveness of this technology appears promising, there is limited research **evalu**ating rates of engagement in **CVT mental health se**rvices or what factors may predict premature attrition from mental health care delivered via this format. Methods: The present study aimed to investigate treatment engagement among veterans enrolled in psychotherapy delivered via CVT, as well as to explore the effects of various demographic and clinical characteristics on these outcomes. Participants were 250 veterans with consults placed to the CVT clinic at a large Midwestern VHA.** To e**valuate characteristics related to therapy retention, demographic and symptom profile information was gathered from a subset of 93 participants who attended at least one CVT psychotherapy appointment. Results: Results indicated there were no significant demographic differences between veterans who attended at least one CVT appointment and those who did not attend at least one session. Demographic variables were not related to the number of CVT visits attended. Regarding psychological characteristics, veterans with anxiety disorders attended fewer CVT appointments overall than veterans with mood disorders and attendance at CVT was negatively correlated with anxiety severity. Discussion: These findings have potential implications for providers working in CVT clinics as well as for future research in this area.  The Author(s) 2018. eid: 2-s2.0-85059667168

In the wake of the recent pandemic of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), with confirmed cases having crossed 750,000, health **system**s across the world are getting overwhelmed; making it strenuous to maintain essential health services. Several changes were implemented in our acute mental health care service using a collaborative approach to maintain a balance between preventive measures to flatten the curve and to provide care to those who were in **need**. Mode of service delivery was changed predominantly to tele-medicine, amongst others. It was found to be a workable model, albeit further follow up will be required to better understand its viability and feasibility to withstand the COVID-19 cataclysm.  2020 eid: 2-s2.0-85083013026

The COVID-19 pandemic threatens to disrupt the provision of **mental health servic**es. In response, policymakers, administrators, and providers have taken bold steps toward enabling telepsychiatry to bridge this sudden gap in care for our most vulnerable populations. With rapid deregulation and adoption of this modality of care, careful consideration of issues related to policy and implementation is essential to maximize its effectiveness and mitigate unintended consequences. Though the crisis places the healthcare **system** under strain, it sets the stage for a lasting shift in not only how care is delivered, but also our beliefs around **the sy**stems capacity for rapid, innovative change.  2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature. eid: 2-s2.0-85084131396

6. **Risperidone for night terrors and sleepwalking in an adult: A case report**
Objective: To report the successful treatment of a case of night terrors and sleepwalking in an adult using low-dose risperidone. Case Summary: A 30-year-old female with a history of nightmares as a teen, but with no prior psychiatric history, presented with new-onset night terrors and sleepwalking related to psychosocial stressors. She recalled images of being chased by monsters and of people trying to hurt her. Sleepwalking sometimes involved self-injurious behavior, as she ran through the house screaming. Intake diagnoses included general anxiety disorder (GAD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD). She reported compulsive counting since childhood and episodes of compulsive eating. Risperidone 1 mg was started and eventually titrated to 2 mg at night for night terror and sleepwalking suppression. For GAD, OCD, and OCPD, paroxetine 10 mg was started and titrated to 50 mg. Temazepam 30 mg was added to prolong sleep and cyproheptadine 4 mg was prescribed for anorgasmia. Symptoms were well controlled with the medications for about 8 months. The patient chose to stop the paroxetine and temazepam on day 655, but continued to take risperidone 2 mg for approximately 45 days. When she discontinued the risperidone, the night terrors and sleepwalking returned within 3 days. Discussion: Low-dose risperidone has been shown to modulate combat posttraumatic stress disorder nightmares. Its effectiveness for night terrors and sleepwalking has not been reported. In this case, risperidone was the sole medication suppressing night terrors and sleepwalking for a month and a half. As found in previous studies, 2 mg of risperidone seemed to be the optimal dose. Conclusions: Risperidone dosed at 1-2 mg at night may be a pharmacologic alternative for the symptoms of sleep terrors with sleepwalking.  1985-2013 Harvey Whitney Books Co.

7. **States leverage telepsychiatry solutions to ease ED crowding, accelerate care**
Many states are having success turning to telepsychiatry-based solutions to connect mental health patients with **need**ed care while also decompressing crowded EDs. Just one year into a statewide telepsychiatry **initi**ative in North Carolina (NC-STeP), administrators say the approach has saved as much as $7 million, and hospital demand for the service is higher than anticipated. In Texas, mental health emergency centers (MHEC) that use telepsychiatry to connect patients in **rural** areas w**ith **needed psychiatric care are freeing up EDs to focus on medical care. In just 11 months, 91 North Carolina hospitals have at least started the process to engage in NC-STeP. Much of the savings from NC-STeP come from involuntary commitment orders being overturned as a result of the telepsychiatry consults, reduc**ing **the need for expensive inpatient care. Implementing NC-STeP has involved multiple hurdles including credentialing difficulties and technical/firewall challenges. The Texas model provides 24/7 availability of psychiatrists via telemedicine through a network of MHECs. In-person staff at the MHECs perform basic screening tests and blood draws so that medical clearance can be achieved **with**out the need for an ED visit in most cases. Funding for the MHECs comes from the state, hospitals in the region, and local governmental authorities that reap savings or benefits from **the i**nitiative. eid: 2-s2.0-84925031051
8. **Successfully navigating multiple electronic health records when using telepsychiatry: The NC-STeP experience**
Telepsychiatry is a viable option for providing psychiatric care to those who are currently underserved or who lack access to services, but barriers to its widespread utilization remain. Use of different electronic health record **system**s (EHRs) by various health c**are sy**stems is one such barrier. Utilization of different EHRs makes it difficult for providers to review patient data and to document clinical encounters.

9. **Community based telepsychiatry service for older adults residing in a rural and remote region- utilization pattern and satisfaction among stakeholders**
Background: **Evalu**ation of telepsychiatry (via videoconference) for older adults is mostly focussed on nursing homes or inpatients.** We e**valuated the role of a community based program for older adults in **rural** and **remot**e regions of South Australia. Method: The utilization pattern was studied using retrospective chart review of telepsychiatry assessments over 24 months (2010-2011). Satisfact**ion w**as evaluated through prospective post-consultation feedback (using a 5-point Likert scale), from patients, community based clinicians and psychiatrist participating in consecutive assessments from April-November 2012. Descriptive analysis was used for the utilization. Mean scores and proportions were calculated for the feedback. Mann Whitney U test was used to compare patient subgroups based on age, gender, prior exposure to telepsychiatry services and inpatient/ outpatient status. Feedback comments were analysed for emerging themes. Results: On retrospective review of 134 consults, mean age was 75.89 years (SD 7.55), 60.4% (81) were females, and 71.6% (96) lived independently. Patients had a broad range of psychiatric disorders, from mood disorders to delirium and dementia, with co-morbid medical illness in 83.5% (112). **On fe**edback evaluation (N = 98), mean scores ranged from 3.88-4.41 for patients, 4.36-4.73 for clinicians and 3.67-4.45 for psychiatrists. Feedback from inpatients (14 out of 37) was significantly lower compared to outpatients (37 out of 61) (chi sq. = 0.808, p < 0.05), and they were significantly less satisfied with the wait time (U = 163.0, p < 0.05) and visual clarity (U = 160.5, p < 0.05). Audio clarity was the most common aspect of dissatisfaction (mean score less than 3) among patients (6, 11%). Psychiatrists reported a preference for telepsychiatry over **face to fac**e in 55.4% (46) assessments. However, they expressed discomfort in situations of cognitive or sensory disabilities in patients. Conclusions:** In r**ural **and r**emote areas, community-based telepsychiatry program can be a useful adjunct for psychiatrist input in the care of older adults. Innovations to overcome sensory deficits and collaboration with community services should be explored to improve its acceptance among the most vulnerable population.  2018 The Author(s). eid: 2-s2.0-85054051128
10. **Tower of Babel Problem in Telehealth: Addressing the Health Information Exchange Needs of the North Carolina Statewide Telepsychiatry Program (NC-STeP)**
Telepsychiatry is a viable option for providing psychiatric care to those who are currently underserved or who lack access to services. While the current technology is adequate for most uses, and continues to advance, there remain barriers to its widespread utilization. One such barrier when working with different healthcare **system**s is that they utilize different electronic medical rec**ord sy**stems (EMRs). This paper describes the experience of the North Carolina Statewide Telepsychiatry Program (NC-STeP) with this problem and how the program successfully resolved it by establishing a web portal that connects participating hospital emergency departments and **remot**e psychiatric providers to share secure electronic health information regarding patient encounters across different EMRs. The Portal also facilitates scheduling, status tracking, and reporting on each patient encounter, as well as delivers the necessary data for the billing to process charges for each consult and to administrators for the operation of the program. The portal effectively bridges the **need**s of the multiple actors in the telepsychiatry virtual encounter. It provides an efficient experience for the patient and the point-of-care provider, a reliable document exchange for the psychiatric provider, and effective record keeping for the billing and government entities.  2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature. eid: 2-s2.0-85037990118
11. **Rejection of the visual in telepsychotherapy**
Despite the progressively decreasing cost and complexity of videotelephones and computer videoconferencing, the telephone remains the preferred instrument of most psychoanalysts and psychotherapists for treatment at a distance, some even proclaiming the advantages of neither seeing nor being seen. This communication addresses possible causal and consequential implications of this rejection of the visual. Pertinent contributory factors considered include: individual variations in preference for sensory modalities, a neophobic reaction of anxious befuddlement in the face of new technology, habit, and institutionalized bias. The psychoanalytic rationale for the use of the couch with its attendant visual deprivation is reviewed in the light of linguistic theory and research advances in the neuropsychology of nonverbal communication. A survey questionnaire is offered to the reader to help answer some of the questions raised. eid: 2-s2.0-0034534150
12. **Psychology and Medical Rehabilitation: Moving Toward a Consumer-Driven Health Care System**
Changes in health care will provide both opportunities and threats for rehabilitation psychologists. We must demonstrate the relevance of our clinical services to important outcomes or risk being excluded as treatment providers. With shifts to nonhospital settings, we can provide increasing clinical and administrative leadership. However, we must redefine models of treatment to include home care and "telepsychology," practice guidelines and critical paths, involvement of paraprofessionals, case management, injury prevention, and health promotion. We should be involved when datasets are established to define disability-related health policies and reimbursement and be proactive in Medicare, Medicaid, and managed care reform to **develop** treatment packages to decrease long-term handicap. Collaboration with consumers is critical. We must frame research questions to address current policy issues. Our skills can help improve the effectiveness of human behavior, whether it be patients with illness, consumers with disability, health care providers, health **system**s managers, or legislators. eid: 2-s2.0-0006713725
13. **Core belief content examined in a large sample of patients using online cognitive behaviour therapy**
Abstract Background Computerised cognitive behavioural therapy provides a unique opportunity to collect and analyse data regarding the idiosyncratic content of people's core beliefs about the self, others and the world. Methods 'Beating the Blues' users recorded a core belief derived through the downward arrow technique. Core beliefs from 1813 mental health patients were coded into 10 categories. Results The most common were global self-**evalu**ation, attachment, and competence. Women were more likely, and men were less likely (than chance), to provide an attachment-related core belief; and men were more likely, and women less likely, to provide a self-competence-related core belief. This may be linked to gender differences in sources of self-esteem. Those who were suffering from anxiety were more likely to provide power- and control-themed core beliefs and less likely to provide attachment core beliefs than chance. Finally, those who had thoughts of suicide in the preceding week reported less competence themed core beliefs and more global s**elf-e**valuation (e.g., 'I am useless') core beliefs than chance. Limitations Concurrent symptom level was not available. The sample was not nationally representative, and featured programme completers only. Conclusions Men and women may focus on different core beliefs in the context of CBT. Those suffering anxiety may **need** a therapeutic focus on power and control. A complete rejection of the self (not just within one domain, such as competence) may be linked to thoughts of suicide. Future research should examine how individual differences and symptom severity influence core beliefs.  2015 The Authors. eid: 2-s2.0-84938815259
14. **Training psychiatrists for rural practice: A 20-year follow-up**
Objective: This report describes the **Rural** Psychiatry Residency Program at the University of New Mexico (UNM RPRP) and presents findings from a survey of program graduates. Methods: Current practice location of residency graduates was identified to learn whether graduates of the UNM RPRP continued to practice** in r**ural communities compared to the graduates of the traditional residency program. Additionally, a web-based survey was completed by 37 of the 60 graduates who participated in the UNM RPRP since its inception in 1991 through 2010. Questions addressed current practice, perceived barriers, and perceptions of experiences. Results: Thirty-seven percent of the graduates from the UNM RPRP currently prac**tice **in rural communities compared to 10 % of the graduates from the traditional residency track. Of the survey respondents, 95 % continue to work with underserved individuals. Reported barriers to **pract**ice in rural areas include professional isolation, lack of referral resources, and travel distances. Respondents reported valuing education about **system**s based practice and telepsychiatry. Conclusion: Purposeful and well-coordinated educational opportunit**ies s**ituated in rural community health clinics can address some of the barriers for recruiting and retaining practici**ng ps**ychiatrists in rural areas. Practical skill building at the individual, agency, **and sy**stem level is integral in training psychiatrists for work in these communities. In particular, the use of telepsychiatry emerged as an important practical applicati**on fo**r the provision of rural mental health care.  2014 Academic Psychiatry. eid: 2-s2.0-84907187036
15. **Videoconference Grief Group Counseling in Rural Texas: Outcomes, Challenges, and Lessons Learned**
Disparities in access to mental health care, especially in **rural** areas, demand continued attention from practitioners, researchers, and community stakeholders. Telehealth, or the use of long distance technology to provide **mental health servic**es, is one well-recognized solution for reducing mental health disparities. At the Telehealth Counseling Clinic, advanced doctoral students provide telepsychology services to low-income and uninsured individuals living i**n a r**ural region in Texas. In response to an identified community **need** for grief counseling services, an 8-week grief group utilizing videoconference technology was conducted. This article discusses clinical and methodological challenges and lessons learned that are unique to delivering group counseling services over videoconference technolo**gy in** a rural area, as well as preliminary data of the groups effectiveness as measured by a satisfaction survey, the Patient Health Questionnaire9, the COREB, and the Complicated Grief Assessment are presented.  2016 ASGW. eid: 2-s2.0-84961206491
16. **Psychosis 101: Evaluating a training programme for northern and remote youth mental health service providers**
Background: Most of the early psychosis intervention (EPI) training has focused on family physicians participants. In Northern Ontario, there is a shortage of primary care. This paper will present **evalu**ation results of a pilot training programme for **rural** and **remot**e youth **mental health servic**e providers. Method: A mixed methods approach was used.** We e**valuated a 2-day workshop about EPI for non-medical mental health workers delivered onsite and simultaneously by videoconferencing. There were 19 participants across four agencies. Seven were onsite and 12 were offsite. Participants' knowledge was measured using a validated questionnaire at pre-intervention and at 3-, 6- and 9-month follow up. A repeated measures ANOVA was **used **to evaluate knowledge acquisition between the two modes of training. At 6 months, focus group interviews were conducted to explore their experiences of the mode of intervention d**elive**ry and evaluation. Emerging themes were iteratively derived through a series of discussions involving independent coders. Results: Only 15 complete datasets were available of the 19 original participants. Differences in knowledge acquisition between the two groups did not reach statistical difference. Six-month focus group data indicated that participants improved their relationship with EPI services and they were part of a strengthened network with other providers in the region. Post-intervention, the accuracy of referrals from participating agencies increased dramatically, with an increase in proportion of referrals who were eligible for EPI services. The follow-up process engaged participants in learning and re-engaged them with the material taught during the training session. Conclusions: The results about **develop**ing service partnerships and relationship with specialist services are encouraging for policy and service decision-makers to addr**ess mental health se**rvice **need**s in northern **and r**emote areas.  2013 Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd. eid: 2-s2.0-84886747839
17. **Design and development of a stepped-care behavioral intervention to support parents of young children newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes**
One of the most common chronic conditions of childhood, the prevalence of type 1 diabetes (T1D) in young children is increasing. Early childhood **develop**ment complicates optimal T1D management and glycemic outcomes. Parents are at risk for elevated psychological distress, especially immediately following diagnosis. Few empirically supported interventions are available to support parents and promote optimal T1D management during this vulnerable period. This paper reports on **the dev**elopment and study design of First STEPS: Study of Type 1 in Early childhood and Parenting Support. The aim of this trial is to **evalu**ate the efficacy of a stepped care behavioral intervention for parents of young children over the first year following a new T1D diagnosis. The stepped care design provides participants with up to three intensity levels, or steps, of clinical behavioral intervention support based on **need**, compared to usual care. Intervention steps include peer parent coaching, telephone-based behavioral support, personalized psychological assessment and recommendations, and intensive assessment of T1D glycemic management with recommendations. Primary outcomes include children's glycemic control and parents' psychosocial functioning. Secondary outcomes include children's behavioral and psychosocial functioning. Exploratory analyses w**ill e**valuate demographic, disease-specific, and psychosocial factors related to progression in and response to each step of the intervention.  2017 Elsevier Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-85027531152
18. **Effectiveness of an online CBT-i intervention and a face-to-face treatment for shift work sleep disorder: A comparison of sleep diary data**
In western societies, about one in six employees works in shifts. Shiftwork is associated with a number of poor somatic and psychological health outcomes, especially sleep issues. Higher rates of absenteeism and accidents in the workplace are possible consequences. Still, prevention programs and treatment options that are specifically tailored to shift-workers **need**s are rare. We devised a 4-week online cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) intervention (n = 21) and compared sleep outcomes to a face-to-face outpatient treatment for shift-workers (n = 12) using a sleep diary and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). In the online sample, measures also included the World Health Organization wellbeing questionnaire (WHO-5) and the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). In the outpatient sample, the Beck **Depress**ion Inventory (BDI-II), the Montgomerysb**erg Dep**ression Rating Scale (MADRS), and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) were administered. Results showed significant improvements in sleep efficiency by 7.2% in the online sample and 7.7% in the outpatient sample. However, no significant difference was found in the rate of improvement in sleep efficiency across four weeks of treatment between the samples. In the online sample, the wellbeing (WHO-5) and insomnia symptoms (ISI) scores were significantly improved following the CBT-I intervention (p < 0.004 and p < 0.002 respectively). In the outpatient sample, symp**toms of** depression (BDI-II and MADRS scores) and insomnia symptoms (PSQI scores) improved significantly following the CBT-I intervention. In summary, CBT-I significantly improved sleep efficiency in both the online and outpatient samples, in addition to wellbeing, symptoms of in**somnia,** and depression. The findings of this study demonstrate online CBT-I as a feasible approach for treating insomnia in shift-workers. Future randomized controlled trials **are **needed.  2019 by the authors.

19. **Use of Telepsychiatry in Pediatric Emergency Room to Decrease Length of Stay for Psychiatric Patients, Improve Resident On-Call Burden, and Reduce Factors Related to Physician Burnout**
Background: Our study aims to demonstrate through implementation of telepsychiatry for child psychiatry patients **evalu**ated in the pediatric emergency room (PedsER); we can reduce length of stay (LOS) and reduce factors contributing to physician burnout through reduction of on-call travel burden. Introduction: Telepsychiatry has increased access to health care using real-time interactive videoconferencing, allowing clinicians and patients in separate locations to have a meaningful clinical encounter. Use has increased over the past several years given cost reduction and **need** for psychiatric specialty services in under-resourced **system**s. Materials and Methods:** We e**valuated data regarding child psychiatry fellow use of telepsychiatry through a prospective real-time questionnaire filled out by the on-call clinician from July 1, 2017 to December 23, 2017 (study period). LOS was measured from the patient's registration time through time of discharge. Results: Telepsychiatry significantly reduced the total monthly LOS for nonhospitalized patients in the PedsER during the study period compared to all prior months (285-193 h; p = 0.032) and compared to a similar prior seasonal time frame (329-193 h; p = 0.017). Telepsychiatry use reduced travel for face-**to-fa**ce evaluations by 75% and saved 2.22 h per call day. Discussion: Unique in this study is enhancing on-site psychiatric consultation in the emergency room, rather than solvin**g a sy**stems issue of referring out for psychiatric consultation. Moreover, this study uniquely demonstrated a noted improvement in on-call physician travel burden by reducing travel time with telepsychiatry. Physician burnout is notably high during residency training. Factors such as telepsychiatry can improve work efficiency and lend time to activities outside of work, mitigating the onset of this challenging issue. Conclusions: Telepsychiatry was shown to be effective in reducing dwell time and improving on-call burden. This study also showed promise** in ou**r system for improving access to other forms of specialized care consultation in PedsER settings.

20. **Computer applications in psychiatry: Role in patient care, education, research and communication**
In recent years, computer use has pervaded almost every aspect of the practice of medicine. Although computers have been in use in psychiatry since the early 1950s, it was the last decade that has witnessed the greatest growth. While computers cannot replace the careful attention and compassion of human contact, they can perform standardized operations much faster and more accurately. The current interest in computer use is associated with two phenomena: one is the availability of home, office, and portable computers; and the other is the exponential growth in the information that has to be processed in order to deliver optimal care. Computers have advanced patient care through improvements in documentation, **evalu**ation, and treatment modalities (e.g., virtual reality). They have advanced education by providing convenient access to academic resources, adding decision support modules to electronic records, and by introducing educational software. Research was promoted through the use of sophisticated statistical tools, the convenience of access to clinical databases, and through the introduction of **new e**valuation and treatment modalities. Communication on intranets and on the Internet has significantly improved all aspects of psychiatric practice. Specific topics that require further **develop**ment and clarification include: electronic records, confidentiality in electronic networks, the role of telepsychiatry and virtual reality in psychiatric treatment and rehabilitation. eid: 2-s2.0-0012433071

There have been a number of important **develop**ments in Australia in the area of telemedicine. At the national level, the House of Representatives' Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs has been conducting the Inquiry into Health Information Management and Telemedicine. The Australian Health Ministers' Advisory Council has supported the establishment of a working party convened by the South Australian Health Commission to prepare a detailed report on issues relating to telemedicine. State governments have begun a number of telemedicine projects, including major **initi**atives in New South Wales and Victoria and the extens**ive dev**elopment of telepsychiatry services in Queensland. Research activities in high-speed image transmission have been undertaken by the Australian Computing and Communications Institute and Telstra, and by the Australian Navy. The matter of the funding of both capital and recurrent costs of telemedicine services has not been resolved, and issues of security and privacy of medical information are subject to discussion. The use of the Internet as a universal communications medium may provide opportunities for the expansion of telemedicine services, particularly in the area of continuing medical education. A **need** has been recognized for the coordinated **evalu**ation of telemedicine services as cost-benefit considerations are seen to be very important. eid: 2-s2.0-0031310962
23. **Telepsychiatry in South Africa - Present and future**
The recent progress in telepsychiatry results from advancing technology and videoconferencing as an effective alternative to classic face-to-face psychiatric interaction, in terms of both results and cost-effectiveness. The wide range of applications of telepsychiatry is outlined - in particular, emergency, forensic, prison and adolescent psychiatry. Attitudes of patients and the providers of psychiatric services are discussed, and a short account is given of the place of tele-education in psychiatric teaching. The advantages of telepsychiatry are outlined and its limitations are discussed. Lastly,the limited experience and relevance of telepsychiatry in South Africa (and hence for other **develop**ing countries) are presented. The conclusion is that telepsychiatry is well established, its successes documented, and that it should be applied in planning future public health services in South Africa. eid: 2-s2.0-77955381009
24. **Telephone-based low intensity therapy after crisis presentations to the emergency department is associated with improved outcomes**
Introduction In Australia there is an overwhelming **need** to provide effective treatment to patients presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) in mental health crisis. We adapted Improving Access to Psychological Therapies service model (IAPT) from the National Health Service (NHS) method for the large scale delivery of psychological therapies throughout the United Kingdom to an Australian ED setting. This telephone-based low intensity therapy was provided to people presenting in crisis to the EDs with combinations of anxiety, **depress**ion, substance use, and suicidal thinking. Methods This uncontrolled study utilised session-by-session, before-and-after measures of anxiety **and dep**ression via Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7). Results Of 347 eligible post-crisis ED referred patients, 291 (83.9%) engaged with the IAPT team. Most patients (65%) had attended the ED previously on an average of 3.9 (SD = 6.0) occasions. Two hundred and forty one patients received an average of 4.1 (SD = 2.3) contacts of low-intensity psychological therapies including 1.2 (SD = 1.7) community outreach visits between 20th Oct 2011 and 31st Dec 2012. Treated patients reported clinically significant improvements in a**nxiety,** depression and suicidal ideation. Uncontrolled effect sizes were moderate for anxiet**y (0.6)** and depression (0.6). Discussion The Australian ED IAPT program demonstrated that the UK IAPT program could be adapted for emergency mental health patients and be associated with similar clinical benefits as the original program.

The following is a case report of a 15-year-old adolescent who was **evalu**ated and treated via telepsychiatry as part of an ongoing project at the University of Michigan Health **System** and the Hiawatha Community Mental Health Center in Michigan. In addition to clinical information, prospective quantitative data was collected at baseline, 6 weeks, and 3 months. Measures included the Youth Self Report (YSR), Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), Suicide Probability Scale (SPS), Reynold's Adolescent **Depress**ion Scale (RADS), Connor's Global Index - Parent Version (CGI-P), and the Children's Global Assessment Scale (CGAS). Prior to the telepsychiatry intervention, the patient was diagnosed as having bipolar disorder with psychosis. During the telepsychiatry intervention, the diagnosis was altered to a posttraumatic stress disorder; medications were discontinued and the patient improved. All scales showed reductions in severity of symptoms after the telepsychiatry interventions. This case represents the first application of adolescent telepsychiatry for the diagnosis, treatment, and tracking of clinical symptoms. eid: 2-s2.0-0142232046

Objective: In 2009, the Departments of Psychiatry and Telehealth of the University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN) **initi**ated a three year project to **develop** telepsychiatry services in KwaZulu-Natal. This paper describes the challenges and opportunities of this project. Method: This was a collaborative, in situ health service project and an action research framework was adopted. Over the three years, following a **need**s assessment and an e-health Readiness Assessment, two action research cycles were completed. Cycle 1: The preparation, implementation and **evalu**ation of educational material, technical requirements and clinical guidelines and clinical support materials. Cycle 2: Preparation **and e**valuation of educational and clinical outreach sessions. Results: Videoconference education sessions were beneficial to health staff without post-qualification psychiatry training. A flexible format for education improved knowledge outcomes. Clinical sessions are feasible, but require administration and technical support for facilitation. With facilitator training, 128Kbps is a suitable bandwidth for education but 384Kbps is preferred for clinical consultation. Conclusion: Telepsychiatry offers tremendous potential to facilitate the three strategies suggested by the World Psychiatric Association to address the treatment gap, save time and costs and improve access to the small pool of specialist psychiatrists in resource constrained environments. eid: 2-s2.0-84871026764

Background: Smartphone overdependence is a type of mental disorder that requires continuous treatment for cure and prevention. A smartphone overdependence management **system** that is based on scientific evidence is required. This study proposes the design, **develop**ment and implementation of a smartphone overdependence managem**ent sy**stem for self-control of smart devices. Metho**ds: Th**e system architecture of the Smartphone Overdependence** Manag**ement System (SOMS) primarily consists of four sessions of mental monitoring: (1) Baseline settlement session; (2) Assessment session; (3) Sensing & monitoring session; and (4) Analysis and feedback session.** We dev**eloped the smartphone-usage-monitoring application (app) and MindsCare personal computer (PC) app to receive and integrate usage data from smartphone users. We analyzed smartphone usage data using the Chi-square Automatic Interaction Detector (CHAID). Based on the baseline settlement results, we designed a feedback service to intervene. We **implem**ented the system using 96 participants for testing and validation. The participants were classified into two groups: the smartphone usage control group (SUC) and the smartphone usage disorder addiction group (SUD). Results: The background smartphone monitoring **app of** the proposed system successfully monitored the smartphone usage based** on the** developed algorithm. The usage minutes of the SUD were higher than the usage minutes of the SUC in 11 of the 16** catego**ries developed in our study. Via the MindsCare PC app, the data were successfully integrated and stored, and managers can successfully analyze and diagnose based on the monitored data. Conclu**sion: **The SOMS is a new system that is based on integrated personalized data for evidence-based smartphone overdependence intervention. The SOMS is useful for managing usage data, diagnosing smartphone overdependence, classifying usage patterns and predicting smar**tphone** overdependence. This system contributes to the diagnosis of an abstract mental status, such as smartphone overdependence, based on specific scientific indicators without reliance on consultation.  2016 by the authors. eid: 2-s2.0-85007426192

Introduction Telepsychiatry is defined as the use of information and communication technology (ICT) in providing **remot**e psychiatric services. Telepsychiatry is applied using two types of communication: synchronous (real time) and asynchronous (store and forward). Objective To determine the cost-effectiveness of a synchronous and an asynchronous telepsychiatric model in prison inmate patients with symptoms of **depress**ion. Methods A cost-effectiveness study was performed on a population consisting of 157patients from the Establecimiento Penitenciario y Carcelario de Mediana Seguridad de Manizales, Colombia. The sample was determined by applying Zung self-administered surveys **for dep**ression (1965) and the H**amilton** Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), the latter being the tool used for the comparison. Results **Initi**al Hamilton score, arrival time, duration of **system** downtime, and clinical effectiveness variables had normal distributions (P>.05). There were significant differences (P<.001) between care costs for the different models, showing that the mean cost of the asynchronous model is less than synchronous model, and making the asynchronous model more cost-effective. Conclusions The asynchronous model is the most cost-effective model of telepsychiatry care for pa**tients **with depression admitted to a detention centre, according to the results of clinical effectiveness, cost measurement, and patient satisfaction.  2016 Asociacin Colombiana de Psiquiatra eid: 2-s2.0-84973590686
30. **The "Biopsychosocial Model": 40 years of application in Psychiatry**
In 1977, the American pathologist and psychiatrist George Engel (1913-1999) published in the Journal Science his paper "TheIn 1977, the American pathologist and psychiatrist George Engel (1913-1999) published in the Journal Science his paper "The**need** for a new medical model: A challenge for biomedicine", introducing the term Biopsychosocial Model. This model basedon the results of Engel's studies in ulcerative colitis, **depress**ion and psychogenic pain, constituted a challenge for biomedicineand the biomedical model. The basic principles of the model included the biological, psychological and social dimensions of the person's life and theperception that the person suffers as a whole and not as isolated organs. The doctor should use a holistic approach regardingillness and should consider his/her relation with the patient socially equal. The personality and the emotional reserves of thepatient, as well as the particular environmental conditions in which the person lives in should be taken into account. There is no doubt that the biopsychosocial model has established a more empathetic and compassionate approach in medical practice. Already since 1936, the general adaptation syndrome had been proposed by the Austrian-Canadian endocrinologist HansSeley (1907-1982), who emphasized that psychological stressful factors may have injurious consequences on health, while theresponse **system**s to stress may be dysregulated not only by genetic factors, but also from experiences and stressful life events,as well as by harmful behaviors such as smoking, alcohol consumption and lack of physical exercise. Psychosocial factors may co-determine the patient's vulnerability and the illness's severity and course. The biopsychosocialmodel consider the interactions with genetic susceptibility, personality, stressful events and, generally, with the patient's socialcontext. Environmental factors increase the probability of the clinical expression of a mental disorder, play a role in the time ofonset of an illness's manifestation, and they can also protect a vulnerable person from the disease. Stressful experiences modify immunological response and influence treatment compliance. Non adherence to pharmacotherapy,as well as to the psychosocial interventions, may cause defective recovery of psychosocial functioning, recurrence ofthe disorder, as well as insufficient use of health resources and a higher health care cost. The psychoeducation of patients andtheir relatives by the application of the biopsychosocial model plays an important role in psychiatric therapeutics, and it mayalso be used via Internet in the frame of telepsychiatry. Results from neuroimaging studies have shown that the different kinds of human experiences, traumatic or therapeutic, havemeasurable influences on the brain function. Psychotherapy may modify the neuronal connections of the brain in the frame ofits plasticity, as was found by the discovery of synaptogenesis in response to learning and can, thus, be considered not only as astrictly psychological but also as a biopsychosocial form of treatment. Among the disadvantages of the biopsychosocial model have been reported the lack of a concise theoretical frameworkregarding its function and content, that it is complicated, difficulties in its coordination and assignment of responsibilities, aswell as problems with the education on it being multifaceted. The biopsychosocial model has been criticized that it does notconstitute a scientific or philosophical model, it does not provide an answer to the crucial question of how the biological, psychologicaland social variables interact in the disease's expression, that it does not provide guidance on the exact time of itsapplication and, finally, that it allows for a wide range of interventions without providing specific guidelines of a concrete therapeutic scheme. The person-centered diagnosis is based on the biopsychosocial model, connects science with humanism and uses all thepossible ways so that the clinicians, the patients and their families collaborate for a more effective management of the disease.This approach has been established by the World Psychiatric Association (WPA, 2007) as the program "Psychiatry for the Person". Psychiatry in everyday practice presents particularities versus other medical disciplines due to the complexity and polymorphismPsychiatry in everyday practice presents particularities versus other medical disciplines due to the complexity and polymorphismof the expression of mental disorders, their close relation to psychosocial factors, the lack of explicit pathognomonicelements and the stigmatization of mental illness. For these reasons, the biopsychosocial model is particularly applicable inpsychiatric disorders, but it should not be over looked also in somatic illnesses. The biopsychosocial model, despite the criticism it was subjected to, continues to offer valuable clinical, educational andresearch services, as well as to provide an important contribution to the formation of health policies, not only for psychiatry, butfor the whole of medicine as well. eid: 2-s2.0-85033670762
31. **Locum Tenens and Telepsychiatry: Trends in Psychiatric Care**
Abstract Background: There is a national shortage of psychiatrists, and according to nationally available data, it is projected to get worse. Locum tenens psychiatry and telepsychiatry are two ways to fill the shortages of psychiatric providers that exist in many areas in the United States. Employment and salary data in these areas can be used to illuminate current trends and anticipate future solutions to the problem of increasing demand for, and decreasing supply of, psychiatrists in the United States. Materials and Methods: A search was conducted of the literature and relevant Web sites, including PubMed, Google Scholar, and www.google.com, as well as information obtained from locum tenens and telepsychiatry organizations. Results: There is a dearth of data on the use of locum tenens in the field of psychiatry, with little available prior to 2000 and few published studies since then. The majority of the data available are survey data from commercial entities. These data show trends toward increasing demand for psychiatry along with increasing salaries and indicate the utilization of telepsychiatry and locum tenens telepsychiatry is increasing. The published academic data that are available show that although locum tenens psychiatry is slightly inferior to routine psychiatric care, telepsychiatry is generally equivalent to face-to-face care. Conclusions: One can anticipate that as the national shortage of psychiatrists is expected to accelerate, use of both locum tenens and telepsychiatry may also continue to increase. Telepsychiatry offers several possible advantages, including lower cost, longer-term services, quality of care, and models that can extend psychiatric services. If current trends continue, **system**s that demand face-to-face psychiatry may find themselves paying higher fees for locum tenens psychiatrists, whereas others may employ psychiatrists more efficiently with telepsychiatry.

32. **Videoconferencing in telepsychiatry**
Interactive videoconferencing is an easy, fast, and relatively inexpensive method of providing psychiatric services over long distances. The experiences of telepsychiatry practitioners have been promising in Finland, Norway, the United Kingdom, the USA, Canada, and Australia. The first practical telepsychiatry experiments in Finland were carried out at the Department of Psychiatry of the University of Oulu, where videoconferencing has been used for family therapy, psychiatric supervision, consultation, patient negotiations, and teaching. During 1998, out of a total of 400 hours, 35% of the online time was used for teaching, 24% for occupational counseling, 21% for consultations and patient negotiations, and 20% for methodological **develop**ment and other activities (mainly testing the connections). The costs of inpatient negotiations via teleconferencing is half those of conventional negotiations. In general, cost analyses have also shown that telepsychiatric services are economically cost-effective in most European countries and in Australia, where a relatively small number of connections exists, while in the USA and Canada, high telecommunications costs make telemedicine more prohibitive compared to conventional care.  2002 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

33. **Computer-supported distance art therapy: A focus on traumatic illness**
We propose computer-supported distance art therapy as an innovative and inexpensive form of telehealth, and present a rationale for **develop**ing distance art therapy services for people with traumatic illnesses. The rationale is based on four current trends: (a) the aging of the population, (b) a shift in focus in the field of telehealth, (c) an increase inpsychosocial treatments for people with traumatic physical illnesses, and (d) the recent burgeoning of the art and healing movement. Forms of telehealth such as computer-supported distance art therapy have both a technical and a human dimension, which **need** to** be dev**eloped in parallel. Our process of partic**ipatory** development and **initi**al feasibility assessment was part of a cross-disciplinary collaboration involving the two authors (an artist/counselor and a computer scientist) and a participatory design team of ten others.  2002 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

34. **A self-guided relaxation module for telepsychiatric services: Development, usefulness, and feasibility**
Objective: A modified form of the standard autogenic relaxation exercise was **develop**ed as part of a telepsychiatry project, which aims to deliver mental healthcare to **remot**e areas through the net, and through the agency of non-specialists. This study describes **the dev**elopment and **evalu**ation of a brief and simpler form of a relaxation technique, the Self-Guided Relaxation (SGR). Method: SGR is a **system**atic technique to focus on muscle groups and feel the heaviness and relaxation through suggestions to induce relaxation in the body. The SGR was taught to 37 patients with different psychiatric disorders over two sessions a week apart. Measures of change used were scores on the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) and a visual analog scale. Its usefulness and feasibility was examined over a follow-up period of one month. Additionally a group of non-specialists was trained in SGR supplemented by audiovisual aids and printed instructions. These therapists rated the ease in learning and administering SGR in patients. Results: There was a consistent reduction in the HAM-A scores over the follow-up period among patients. Improvements were also noted in positive experiences, adherence, depth of relaxation achieved, perceived benefit, and patient satisfaction. Majority of the patients, relatives, and therapists reported that they could administer or practice SGR after having learned the technique in a single session lasting about 30 minutes. The use of audio-video aids and manual was helpful in making the process of learning easy. Conclusions: Preliminary findings of usefulness, feasibility, and acceptance of the SGR were encouraging. These findings pave way for larger, randomized controlled study and for testing applicability of the SGR as a net-based psychological intervention.  2013, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-84896463918
35. **Usefulness of videoconferencing in psychiatric emergencies -- a qualitative study**
High quality health services for psychiatric emergencies are difficult to maintain 24h a day in sparsely populated areas, where the availability of specialists are limited. To overcome this challenge, the University Hospital of North Norway implemented an on-call **system** in psychiatric emergencies, by which psychiatrists are accessible 24/7 for telephone and videoconferencing consultations with patients and nurses at three regional psychiatric centers. The purpose of this study was to explore the usefulness of videoconferencing consultations in psychiatric emergencies. The on-call psychiatrists and nurses at the regional psychiatric centers who participated in at least one videoconferencing consultation were recruited for semi-structured interviews: 5 psychiatrists and 19 nurses for a total of 24 participants. The interviews were performed from July of 2012 to June of 2013. The interviews were transcribed and analyzed using a stepwise-deductive-inductive approach supported by the HyperRESEARCH analysis software. After the introduction of the videoconferenc**ing sy**stem, telephone consultations were still used for straightforward situations when further treatment or admission decisions were obvious. Videoconferencing consultations, during which patients were present, were useful for challenging situations when there was 1) uncertainty regarding the degree of illness or the level of treatment, 2) a **need** to clarify the severity of the patient condition, 3**) a **need to build an alliance with the patient, and 4) disagreement either between health personnel or between the patient and health personnel. Videoconferencing is useful for challenging and complex psychiatric emergencies and is a suitable tool for building high quality, decentralized psychiatric services.  2017, The Author(s). eid: 2-s2.0-85047478559
36. **Cost-effectiveness of a novel e-health depression service**
Objectives: A recent trial assessed feasibility of an e-health service ("Improvehealth.eu") to support **depress**ion care and reported positive outcomes. Our objective was to examine cost-effectiveness of the Improvehealth.eu service. A baseline model was used to **evalu**ate cost and effects of the intervention. Given the high uncertainty in the input space, a series of alternative scenarios w**ere e**valuated to challenge the result. The aim was to find if conservative or even pessimistic estimates and assumptions could result in a change of the cost-effectiveness from the baseline model. Materials and Methods: A probabilis**tic dep**ression model combined with bootstrapping was built and populated with data from the literature and from the pilot efficacy trial of the e-health service. The core of the model was a stochastic mapping function that tra**nslated** depression-specific outcomes to quality-adjusted life years. Correlated sampling was used to obtain unbiased and consistent piecewise linear transformat**ion of **Beck Depression Inventory scores to utilities. The results are shown as cost-effectiveness acceptability curves with value of information data. An extreme scenario analysis was then performed to deal with parameter, structural, and modeling uncertainty. Results: Cost-effectiveness of the e-health service was favorable because of low cost and high efficacy of the intervention. Apart from the most pessimistic one, none of the 13 alternative scenarios changed the preferred alternative. Conclusions: Improvehealth.eu is cost-effective relative to usual care, given the available efficacy data. Results of the health e**conom**ic evaluation were robust to alternative assumptions, despite considerable uncertainty in input data.

37. **Feasibility of Group Cognitive-Behavioral Treatment of Insomnia Delivered by Clinical Video Telehealth**
Background: Clinical video telehealth provides a means for increasing access to psychotherapy. Insomnia is prevalent, is associated with a number of negative sequelae, and can be effectively managed with cognitive behavioral treatment of insomnia (CBT-I). Telehealth technologies can provide a means for increasing access to CBT-I. Materials and Methods: The Tele-Insomnia program is a Veterans Health Administration (VHA) **initi**ative in which CBT-I is delivered in a group format by telehealth. Veterans received six weekly sessions of group CBT-I, completing the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and daily sleep diaries throughout treatment. Paired-samples t-tests were used to examine differences in each measure from the first to the last session of treatment. Results: There were statistically and clinically significant improvements in the ISI and all sleep diary variables with the exception of total sleep time. Video quality was excellent, and there were few connectivity problems. Conclusions: Clinical video telehealth technology can be used to deliver group CBT-I in a manner that produces clinically significant improvement. This model is scalable and has been used to **develop** a national clinical telehealth program.  Copyright 2016, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2016. eid: 2-s2.0-85002882926
38. **A meta-analysis of the effectiveness of individually oriented Cognitive Behavioral Treatment (CBT) for severe aggressive behavior in adolescents**
This meta-analysis, including six studies (13 effect sizes) and 164 adolescents, examined the effectiveness of individually oriented treatment (which means that the intervention contained at least an individual component, possibly in combination with group and/or family therapy) with CBT-elements for adolescents with severe aggression problems. A large and homogeneous overall effect size was found (d=1.139) indicating consistency across studies. The included studies examined the effect of three interventions, namely, mode deactivation therapy (MDT; four studies), stress-inoculation therapy (1), and the cell-phone program (1). This multilevel analysis demonstrated that only few individually oriented interventions have been **develop**ed and **evalu**ated, while four of the included studies used a weak research design. Effective individually tailored interventions for youths with severe aggression problems (who are unsuitable for group treatment) are scant. There may be added value if group interventions are supplemented with more individually tailored evidence-based interventions.  2014,  2014 Taylor & Francis. eid: 2-s2.0-84914147813
39. **A pilot project to improve access to Telepsychotherapy at rural clinics**
Background: The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has pioneered telemental health (TMH) with over 500,000 TMH encounters over the past decade. VA community-based outpatient clinics were established to improve accessibility of mental healthcare for **rural** Veterans. Despite these clinics clinics and increased availability of TMH, m**any r**ural Veterans have difficulty receiving mental healthcare, particularly psychotherapy. Materials and Methods: Twelve therapists participated in a pilot project using TMH technologies to improve mental healthcare service deli**very **to rural Veterans treated at six community clinics. Therapists completed online training, and study staff communicated with them monthly and clinical leaders every other month. Therapists completed two questionnaires: before training and 10 months later. This article describes barriers and facilitators to the implementation of the project, as well as therapists' knowledge, confidence, and motivation regarding TMH. Results: Two clinicians were offering telepsychotherapy after 10 months. At all six sites, unanticipated organizational constraints and administrative barriers delayed implementation; establishing organizational practices and therapists' motivation helped facilitate the process. Adopters of the project reported more positive views of the modality and did not worry about staffing, a concern of nonadopters. Conclusions: Despite barriers to implementation, lessons learned from this pilot project have led to improvements and changes in TMH processes. Results from the pilot showed that therapists providing telepsychotherapy had increased confidence, knowledge, and motivation. As TMH continues to expand, formalized decision-making with clinical leaders regarding project goals, better matching of therapists with this modality, and assessment of medical center and clinic readiness are recommended.  2014, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-84891592314
40. **Telepsychology in Australia: 2020 vision**
The current roll-out of broadband across Australia provides new opportunities for psychologists to reach out to residents in **remot**e and **rural** areas. With the advent of internet protocol (IP)-based videoconferencing, telepsychology is becoming more accessible and affordable, and a potential solution to those** in r**emote areas who require access to specialist assessment and psychotherapy services. Telepsychology represents a high-quality/low-cost model of service delivery. Findings to date suggest that outcome might be equivalent to in-person therapy across a range of client groups both using standardised assessments and evidence-based therapies. Studies have consistently shown that clients rate high levels of satisfaction and therapeutic rapport. However, uptake among psychologists has been slow. This article provides a synthesis of the gradual growth of telepsychology in Australia. It identifies factors that hinder the **develop**ment of telepsychology and outlines the main arguments **for dev**eloping this as a model for the provision of psychology** acro**ss remote **and r**ural Australia. The authors draw on their own recent experie**nces in** developing collaborative telepsychology services to make recommendations for the future of telepsychology in Australia.  2014 N**ation**al Rural Health Alliance Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-84916209260
41. **Designing and implementing an innovative digitally driven primary care psychiatry program in India**
Background: Primary Care Doctors (PCDs) are the first contact for majority of patients with psychiatric disorders across the world including India. They often provide symptomatic treatment which is naturally inadequate. Absence or inadequate exposure to psychiatric training during undergraduate medical education is one of the prime reasons. Classroom training (CRT), a standard practice to train PCDs is driven by specialist based psychiatric curriculum and inherently lacks clinical translational value. Aim and Context: The 'Department of Psychiatry' of 'National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences', Bengaluru, India has recently come up with an innovative digitally driven modules of 'Primary Care Psychiatry Program' (PCPP) for practicing PCDs. Goal of this paper is to provide an overview of all these (five) modules with its various stages of implementation. Methods: Authors briefly discuss the current status of primary care psychiatry in India and also narrate the newly designed five modules of PCPP in this paper. Results and Discussion: An adopted psychiatric curriculum is designed in 'Clinical Schedules for Primary Care Psychiatry' (CSP) which is an integral part of PCPP. This is brief clinical schedules contains culturally appropriate screening questionnaire, transdiagnostic classification of 8 core psychiatric disorders, diagnostic, referral and management guidelines. PCPP contains 5 modules named as orientation module, basic module, advanced module [Tele-psychiatric 'On-Consultation Training' (Tele-OCT)], videoconference based continuing skill **develop**ment module, and collaborative video consultation modules which covers all essential areas of primary care psychiatry for practicing PCDs. Last three modules are fully designed digital modules in hub and spoke model of Tele Medicine. In this designed program, the CSP and Tele-OCT are two path braking innovations having inbuilt higher clinical translation value. The challenges and opportunities that could be faced during its implementation across India are also discussed. Conclusion and Future Directions: Innovative PCPP is pragmatic in nature and has potential for higher clinical translational value. Once validated thoroughly, PCPP has potential for pan-India expansion. There is a **need** for artificial intelligence-based modules for next phase of PCPP in India considering her population and lesser number of available psychiatrists.  2018 Indian Journal of Psychiatry | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow. eid: 2-s2.0-85052293597
42. **Implementation and Utilisation of Telepsychiatry in Ontario: A Population-Based Study**
Objective: **Rural** areas in Ontario have fewer psychiatrists, making access to specialist mental health care challenging. Our objective was to characterise psychiatrists delivering and patients receiving telepsychiatry in Ontario and to determine the number of patients who accessed a psychiatrist via telepsychiatry following discharge from psychiatric hospitalisation. Method: We conducted a serial panel study to **evalu**ate the characteristics of psychiatrists providing telepsychiatry from April 2007 to March 2013. In addition, we conducted a cross-sectional study for fiscal year 2012-2013 to examine telepsychiatry patient characteristics and create an in-**need** patient cohort of individuals with a recent psychiatric hospitalisation that assessed if they had follow-up with a psychiatrist in person or through telepsychiatry within 1 year of discharge. Results: In fiscal year 2012-2013, a total of 3801 people had 5635 telepsychiatry visits, and 7% (n = 138) of Ontario psychiatrists provided telepsychiatry. Of the 48,381 people identified as** in **need of psychiatric care, 60% saw a local psychiatrist, 39% saw no psychiatrist, and less than 1% saw a psychiatrist through telepsychiatry only or telepsychiatry in addition to local psychiatry within a year. Three northern regions had more than 50**% of** in-need patients fail to access psychiatry within 1 year. Conclusions: Currently, relatively few patients and psychiatrists use telepsychiatry. In addition, patients scarcely access telepsychiatry for posthospitalisation follow-up. This study, which serves as a preliminary baseline for telepsychiatry in Ontario, demonstrates that telepsychiatry has not evolved **system**atically** to **address need and highlights the importance** of sy**stem-level planning when implementing telepsychiatry to optimise access to care.

43. **Telepsychiatry appointments in a continuing care setting: Kept, cancelled and no-shows**
We reviewed the appointment data for a psychiatry service in California that provided consultations and also therapy through telepsychiatry. Over an 18-month period, there were 7523 telepsychiatry appointments and 115,148 conventional (face-to-face) appointments. A higher proportion of the telepsychiatry appointments was kept (92% telepsychiatry vs. 87% non-telepsychiatry). Also, telepsychiatry appointments were significantly less likely to be cancelled by patients (3.5% vs. 4.8%) and significantly less likely to be no-shows (4.2% vs. 7.8%). These findings were similar in three of the four counties where the service was delivered. However, one county was different, and further examination suggested that the morale of the staff and patients may have contributed to the unenthusiastic acceptance of telepsychiatry. We conclude that telepsychiatry can be used effectively in continuing care settings as well as in **evalu**ation settings, and that staff and patient morale are important factors in successful telepsychiatry. eid: 2-s2.0-70349696011
44. **Effect of coaching on psychological adjustment in patients with spinocerebellar degeneration: A pilot study**
Objective: To examine effect of coaching intervention on psychological adjustment to illness and health-related QOL (HRQOL) in patients with spinocerebellar degeneration. Design: Randomized controlled trial. Subjects: Twelve independently living patients with spinocerebellar degeneration aged 20-65 years old, without cognitive impairment or psychiatric disorder received coaching intervention, which was postponed in another 12 (control). Interventions: Three physician coaches telephoned assigned patients for 15-30 minutes in each of 10 weekly coaching sessions over three months. Main outcome measures: Primary endpoints were HRQOL (SF-36) and psychological adjustment to illness (Nottingham Adjustment Scale, Japanese version; NAS-J). Results: Two-way analysis of variance (group  time) showed statistically significant main effects of time for vitality (F=5.00; P=0.036), anxiety/**depress**ion (F=5.15; P=0.033), and locus of control (F=5.58; P=0.027), indicating improvement of scores over time in both coaching and control groups. No main effect of group or interaction was seen. However analysis of covariance with baseline scores as the covariate showed the coaching group to have better self-efficacy scores than controls at follow-up (least-square mean, experimental group, 65.1; control group, 52.7; P=0.037). Conclusion: Carefully structured telephone coaching can improve self-efficacy in patients with spinocerebellar degeneration.  Sage Publications 2007. eid: 2-s2.0-36749095747
45. **Readiness of health-care institutions in KwaZulu-Natal to implement telepsychiatry**
We assessed the preparedness of health districts and designated hospitals in the KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) province for proposed telepsychiatry services. An e-health readiness questionnaire for **develop**ing countries was administered to managers of health districts and managers of designated psychiatric hospitals by telephone interview. Ten of the 11 district managers and managers/medical officers of 45 of 58 designated hospitals were interviewed. Notwithstanding some concerns regarding the tool, low levels of e-health readiness were found. District managers recorded e-health readiness scores of 137-217 out of 300. This was similar to the hospital managers, who recorded readiness scores of 121-260 out of 300. For telepsychiatry to succeed in KZN, an awareness programme will be required to facilitate the necessary change management. eid: 2-s2.0-84859705054

Objective: This study examined the agreement between diagnoses and severity ratings assigned by clinicians using a structured web-based interview within a child and adolescent mental health outpatient setting. Method: Information on 100 youths was obtained from multiple informants through a web-based **Develop**ment and Well-Being Assessment (DAWBA). Based on this information, four experienced clinicians independently diagnosed (according to the International Classification of Diseases Revision 10) and rated the severity of mental health problems according to the Health of the Nation Outcome Scales for Children and Adolescents (HoNOSCA) and the Children's Global Assessment Scale (C-GAS). Results: Agreement for diagnosis was K=0.69-0.82. Intra-class correlation for single measures was 0.78 for HoNOSCA and 0.74 for C-GAS, and 0.93 and 0.92, respectively for average measures. Conclusions: Agreement was good to excellent for all diagnostic categories. Agreement for severity was moderate, but improved to substantial when the average of the ratings given by all clinicians was considered. Therefore, we conclude that experienced clinicians can assign reliable diagnoses and assess severity based on DAWBA data collected online.

48. **Telepsychiatry as a case study of presence: Do you know what you are missing?**
This study explores the use of videoconferencing technology as a means of providing mental health consultations across distances. Analyses of 43 psychiatric interviews with 14 different patients using an interactive videoconferencing **system** over an 18-month period reveal that the telecommunications link compared favorably to face-to-face encounters in assessments by physicians and patients. However, telepsychiatry may hinder many of the ancillary practitioner-patient relationships that contribute to a psychiatric consultation and create a false sense of presence. The study stresses the importance of examining the new context created by implementation of any new communication technology, and of understanding the **need** for attention to secondary and peripheral contexts that could potentially be ignored because of telepresence. eid: 2-s2.0-0012752495
49. **Reaching rural communities with culturally appropriate care: A model for adapting remote monitoring to American Indian veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder**
Objective: Providing specialized healthcare to **rural** communities can be extremely difficult, and consequently many health organizations are turning to the use of telehealth technologies for care delivery. One such technology, **remot**e monitoring, has been successfully implemented with patients suffering from chronic and other medical conditions. A drawback, however, is t**hat r**emote monitoring devices are programmed to reach a broad audience, and consequently the content may not be suitable for all patients - especially those who are not a part of the dominant culture. Subjects and Methods: This report provides a model for a**dapti**ng remote monitoring to specific populations who are undergoing care for posttraumatic stress disorder. Adaptation changes focus on (1) information gathering, (2) process and dialogue changes, (3) testing, and (4) patient and administrative feedback. Data for such modifications were gathered through a series of community meetings, patient interviews, and provider feedback. A case example highlights the successful implementation of the adaptation model fo**r a r**ural American Indian Veteran population. Results: Patients showed high acceptability of both the programmatic and cultural adaptations. Feasibility of the program also appeared positive, with most patients reporting that the readability of the program was appropriate, the dialogue duration was not burdensome, and technical problems were rare. C**onclu**sions: Remote monitoring provides the ability to be modified for use with certain subpopulations. Procedural recommendations in this report highlight special considerations for working with American Indians living on or near reservation areas, although the model can be broadly adapted to several groups.

50. **A comparison of mental health diagnoses treated via interactive video and face to face in the veterans healthcare administration**
Objective: This study compares the mental health diagnoses of encounters delivered **face to fac**e and via interactive video in the Veterans Healthcare Administration (VHA). Materials and Methods: We compiled 1 year of national-level VHA administrative data for Fiscal Year 2012 (FY12). Mental health encounters were those with both a VHA Mental Health Stop Code and a Mental Health Diagnosis (n=11,906,114). Interactive video encounters were identified as those with a Mental Health Stop Code, paired with a VHA Telehealth Secondary Stop Code. Primary diagnoses were grouped into posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), **depress**ion, anxiety, bipolar disorder, psychosis, drug use, alcohol use, and other. Results: In FY12, 1.5% of all mental health encounters were delivered via interactive video. Compared with face-to-face encounters, a larger percentage of interactive video encounters was for PT**SD, dep**ression, and anxiety, whereas a smaller percentage was for alcohol use, drug use, or psychosis. Conclusions: Providers and patients may feel more comfortable t**reating** depression and anxiety disorders than substance use or psychosis via interactive video.  2015, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-84936952569

52. **Usability and reliability of a remotely administered adult autism assessment, the autism diagnostic observation schedule (ADOS) module 4**
Introduction: The Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) Module 4 is an autism assessment designed for verbally fluent adolescents and adults. Because of a shortage of available clinical expertise, it can be difficult for adults to receive a proper autism spectrum disorder (ASD) diagnostic assessment. A potential option to address this shortage is **remot**e assessment. The objective of this study was to examine the feasibility, usability, and reliability of administering the ADOS Modul**e 4 r**emotely using the Versatile and Integrated **System** for Telerehabilitation (VISYTER). Materials and Methods: VISYTER consists of computer stations at the client site and clinician site for video communication and a Web portal for managing and coordinating the assessment process. Twenty-three adults with an ASD diagnosis participated in a within-subject crossover design study in which** both** a remote ADOS and a face-to-face ADOS were administered. After com**pleti**ng the remote ADOS, participants completed a satisfaction survey. Results: Participant satisf**actio**n with the remote ADOS deliv**ery sy**stem was high. The kappa value was greater than 0.61 on 21 of 31 ADOS items. There was substantial agreement on ADOS classification (i.e., diagnosis) between assessments delivered face-to-face versus as**sessm**ents delivered remotely (interclass coefficient=0.92). Non-agreement may have been due to outside factors or practice effect despite a washout period. Conclusions: The results of this study demonstrate that an autism assessment designed to be delivered **face to fac****e c**an be administered remotely using an integrated We**b-base**d system with high levels of usability and reliability.

53. **Information Technology and under-served communities**
Advances in information technology (IT) and telecommunications offer many potential benefits to Australia's under-served communities. However, there is also a risk that some of these communities will only be further disadvantaged, as IT will not contribute greatly to bringing groups such as the mentally ill and illiterate into the mainstream of the community. However, other under-served groups may experience service improvements. For people who do not have English as their first language, IT **develop**ments provide opportunities for cheaper and easier service and information delivery in their own languages. Telemedicine and IT also have the potential to make working in **rural** areas more attractive. On the other hand, telemedicine may be used as a means to bypass local health service providers, as has happened with other service industries. The health sector, though, is well behind these other industries in adopting IT and telecommunications. The growth of telemedicine projects is one indication that progress is being made, however. Two case studies - of telepsychiatry, and of medical education at Flinders University - provide examples of major Australian successes. The medical workforce implications will involve the overall numbers and mix of practitioners, their geographical distribution, changing professional boundaries and changing skill requirements. The only certain effect is that if IT changes the nature of medical work, large numbers of medical practitioners will **need** to improve their computer skills and older practitioners will find this most difficult. eid: 2-s2.0-0033257158
54. **Feasibility and promise of a remote-delivered preconception motivational interviewing intervention to reduce risk for alcohol-exposed pregnancy**
Background: Alcohol-exposed pregnancy (AEP) is a leading cause of birth defects. Effective face-to-face preconception interventions based on motivational interviewing (MI) exist and should be translated into **remot**e formats for maximum public health impact. This study investigated the feasibility and promise of a one-sessi**on, r**emote-delivered, preconception, MI-based AEP intervention** (EAR**LY Remote) for non-treatment-seeking community women. Subjects and Methods: This was a single-arm, prospective pilot intervention study. All participants received the intervention via telephone and mail. Fea**sibil**ity of remote-delivery methods, treatment engagement, treatment credibility, MI treatment integrity, and therapeutic alliance were examined. Outcomes were 3- and 6-month drinks per drinking day (DDD), rate of unreliable contraception, and proportion of women at risk for AEP due to continued risk drinking and no or unreliable contraception use. Results:** Feas**ibility of remote delivery was established; participants were engaged by the intervention and rated it as credible. Integrity to MI and therapeutic alliance were good. Both DDD and rate of unreliable contraception decreased significantly over time. Proportions of women who drank at risk levels, used unreliable or no contraception, and/or were at risk for AEP in the past 90 days decreased significantly from baseline to 6 m**onths**. Conclusions: Remote delivery was feasi**ble, **and the translated remote intervention may reduce AE**P ris**k. Refinement of EARLY Remote may facilitate its placement within a spectrum of effective MI-based preconception AEP interventions as part of** a st**epped-care approach. EARLY Remote may have an important role within a stepped-care model for dissemination to geographically disperse women at risk for AEP. This could result in substantial public health impact through reduction of AEP on a larger scale.  Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-84899780736
55. **Treatment outcome comparison between telepsychiatry and face-to-face buprenorphine medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorder: A 2-year retrospective data analysis**
Objectives: To retrospectively review clinic records to assess the difference between face-to-face and telepsychiatry buprenorphine medication-assisted treatment (MAT) programs for the treatment of opioid use disorder on 3 outcomes: additional substance use, average time to achieve 30 and 90 consecutive days of abstinence, and treatment retention rates at 90 and 365 days. Methods: Medical records of patients (N=100) who were participating in telepsychiatry and in face-to-face group-based outpatient buprenorphine MAT programs were reviewed and assessed using descriptive statistical analysis. Results: In comparison with the telepsychiatry MAT group, the face-to-face MAT group showed no significant difference in terms of additional substance use, time to 30 days (P=0.09) and 90 days of abstinence (P=0.22), or retention rates at 90 and 365 days (P=0.99). Conclusions: We did not find any significant statistical difference between telepsychiatry buprenorphine MAT intervention through videoconference and face-to-face MAT treatment in our Comprehensive Opioid Addiction Treatment model for individuals diagnosed with opioid use disorder in terms of additional substance use, average time to 30 and 90 days of abstinence, and treatment retention rates.

57. **The diffusion of telehealth in rural American Indian communities: A retrospective survey of key stakeholders**
Objective: Mental health issues are a serious concern for many American Indian Veterans, especially for post-traumatic stress disorder and related psychiatric conditions. Yet, acquiring mental health treatment can be a challenge in Native communities where specialized services are largely unavailable. Consequently, telehealth is increasingly being suggested as a way to expand healthcare access on or near reservation lands. In this study, we wanted to understand the factors affecting the diffusion of telehealth clinics that provided mental health care to **rural**, American Indian Veterans. Materials and Methods: We surveyed 39 key personnel and stakeholders who were involved in the decision-making process, technological infrastructure, and implementation of three clinics. Using Roger Everett's Diffusion Theory as a framework, we gathered information about specific tasks, factors hindering progress, and personal reactions to telehealth both before and after implementation. Results: Many participants expressed **initi**al concerns about using telehealth; however, most became positive over time. Factors that influenced participants' viewpoint largely included patient and staff feedback and witnessing the fulfillment of a community health **need**. The use of outside information to support the implementation of the clinics and personal champions also showed considerable influence in the clinics' success. Conclusion: The findings presented here address critical gaps in our understanding of telehealth diffusion and inform research strategies regarding the cultural issues and outcomes related to tele**mental health servic**es. Information contained in this report serves as a long overdue guide for **develop**ing telemental health programs and policies among American Indians, specifically, **and r**ural populations in general.  2012 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-84856690652
58. **The Delivery of a Tele-Psychology Service to Shetland**
This paper describes preliminary findings of a pilot project designed to **evalu**ate a teleconferencing clinical psychology service between Aberdeen and Shetland. Over a 12-month period, 10 clients were assessed face-to-face in Shetland, then attended an average of 12 therapy sessions each via a teleconferencing link with a clinical psychologist based in Aberdeen. The majority of clients reported that they were satisfied with the tele-therapy, and some expressed a preference for this mode of communication because they felt it reduced confrontational aspects of contact and increased their perception of control. One client was not able to continue after two **initi**al sessions due his discomfort at discussing his difficulties 'in Cyberspace'. The clinical psychologist was satisfied with using teleconferencing as a mode of providing treatment, and felt that therapeutic rapport was not compromised by the technology. A number of recommendations are made for consideration by those planning to deliver telepsychology services in future. Copyright  2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. eid: 2-s2.0-0004531530
59. **Agreement between telepsychiatry assessment and face-to-face assessment for Emergency Department psychiatry patients**
We compared psychiatrists' **evalu**ations of Emergency Department (ED) mental health patients made face-to-face or by telemedicine. In a 39-month study, 73 patients presenting in the ED were enrolled after **initi**al screening. Patients were interviewed by a psychiatrist either face-to-face in the ED or **remot**ely by video. A second psychiatrist, acting as an observer, was in the room with the patient and independently completed the assessment. Based on the primary diagnosis of the interviewer, 48% of patients had a **depress**ive disorder, 18% a substance use disorder, 14% a bipolar disorder, 11% a psychotic disorder, 6% an anxiety disorder and 4% other disorders. The raw agreement between the psychiatrists about disposition when both used face-to-face assessment was 84% and it was 86% when one used telemedicine. Using Cohen's kappa** to e**valuate agreement, there were no significant differences for disposition recommendation, strength of recommendation, diagnosis or the HCR-20 dangerousness scale. There was no significant difference for the intraclass correlation coefficients for the suicide scale. The results provide preliminary support for the safe use of telepsychiatry in the ED to determine the **need** for admission to inpatient care.

60. **Feasibility and effectiveness of telepsychiatry services for Chinese immigrants in a nursing home**
This study investigates the feasibility and effectiveness of providing telepsychiatry services to Chinese immigrants in a nursing home. The psychiatrist interviewed patients face-to-face for the **initi**al consultation, and encouraged them to participate in this study to receive telepsychiatry-based follow-up visits. The feasibility and outcomes of telepsychiatry visits and satisfaction of the subjects, their families, and the nursing home staff were assessed. Nine monolingual Chinese immigrants, 8 women and 1 man, ranging from 54 to 88 years of age, were enrolled. The main reasons for psychiatric consultation were mood and behavioral problems. Eight of the 9 (88.9%) subjects participated in videoconference follow-up visits, and 1 subject (11.1%) declined. Among the 8 subjects, 6 were referred for psychiatric intervention, 1 for differential diagnosis, and 1 for suicide assessment. At the end of the study, all 6 subjects referred for intervention had greatly improved; the subjects, their families, and the nursing staff were highly satisfied with the telepsychiatry service. It is feasible to provide psychiatry consultations to ethnic immigrants in a nursing home despite the fact that many of them are unfamiliar with the technology and suffer from dementia and psychotic symptoms. Telepsychiatry provides an efficient way for ethnic elders in nursing homes to connect with mental health professionals with the appropriate language and cultural background, regardless of location. Telepsychiatry may decrease the disparities in treatment of mental illnesses among ethnic immigrants in nursing homes.  2009, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-66149190915

Palsbo SE. Medicaid payment for telerehabilitation. Arch Phys Med Rehabil 2004;85:1188-91. Objective To assess current payment practice for telerehabilitation in state Medicaid programs. Design Telephone survey. Setting State Medicaid programs. Participants State Medicaid directors. Interventions Not applicable. Main outcome measure Descriptive. Results Half of the 35 state Medicaid programs contacted reimbursed at least some telemedicine services other than radiology in 2002. The primary reason for reimbursing for telemedicine is to make services available when there is no local practitioner. Consultation and **evalu**ation and management services were most likely to be reimbursed (12 states). Seven state programs reimbursed telepsychology, and 4 states reported reimbursing for telespeech and language pathology, physical therapy, or occupational therapy. Conclusions Telemedicine helps Medicaid programs deliver specialized care to locations with provider shortages. Telerehabilitation is not yet widespread, despite its potential benefit to people with disabilities who cannot travel to a clinic for rehabilitation therapy. Most Medicaid programs calculate the financial costs and patient benefits when considering payment policies, and about half of states require a state law to allow payment for telerehabilitation. Minnesota, Hawaii, and Nebraska, among the responding states, currently reimburse for telerehabilitation. Research is **need**ed** to e**valuate the appropriateness of telerehabilitation for Medicaid beneficiaries.  2004 by the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine and the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation. eid: 2-s2.0-3242678150
62. **Predictors of 12-month outcome in smokers who received bupropion sustained-release for smoking cessation**
Aim: To examine heterogeneity in outcome at 12 months following 8 weeks of treatment for smoking cessation with bupropion sustained-release (SR) 150 or 300 mg/day combined with behavioural counselling. Design, setting, participants: Smokers were recruited from a large healthcare **system** and then randomized to receive either bupropion SR 150 mg/day (n = 763) or 300 mg/day (n = 761) taken for 8 weeks in combination with either proactive telephone counselling or a tailored mail approach. Measurements and findings: A comprehensive set of relevant individual pretreatment and treatment characteristics was included in the analysis. Smoking outcome at 12 months was defined as point-prevalence of any regular self-reported smoking within the 7 days prior to follow-up contact. Classification and regression tree analysis identified subgroups that varied with respect to likelihood of being nonsmokers at 12 months. Seven subgroups were identified among those receiving bupropion SR 150 mg/day (proportion of nonsmokers at 12 months ranged from 13.7% to 43.5%) and eight subgroups among those receiving bupropion SR 300 mg/day (proportion of nonsmokers at 12 months ranged from 9.6% to 51.7%). In the 150-mg/day group, those with the lowest rate reported no previous quit attempt of 1 month or more in duration while those with the highest rate all reported previous quit attempts of 1 month or longer. In the 300 mg/day group, those with the lowest rate had very high levels of dependence while those with the highest rate were more highly educated and smoked at a lower level. Across all subgroups, cost per 12-month quitter ranged from a low of $US302 to a high of $US2502. Conclusions: These results indicate the presence of a substantial amount of variation in outcome following treatment with both dosages of bupropion SR, with substantial cost consequences. Variation in outcome could be reduced by providing treatments tailored to subgroups of individuals who are at exceptionally high risk for smoking following a quit attempt.  2008 Adis Data Information BV.

63. **Psychosocial Outcomes of Telephone-Based Counseling for Adults With an Acquired Physical Disability: A Meta-Analysis**
Background: The delivery of **mental health servic**es by telephone, referred to as telecounseling, has the potential to improve the health outcomes of adults with an acquired physical disability in a cost-effective way. However, the efficacy of this form of treatment requires further **evalu**ation before it is used on a larger scale. Aim: This meta-analysis provides a critical and quantitat**ive e**valuation of the impact of telephone-administered psychological interventions on the psychosocial functioning of adults with an acquired physical disability caused by spinal cord injury, limb amputation, severe burn injury, stroke, or multiple sclerosis. Method: A comprehensive search of eight electronic databases identified eight studies (N = 658 participants) that compared treatment efficacy to that of matched control groups. Differences in the psychosocial outcomes of treatment and control participants were examined using Cohen's d effect sizes. Fail-safe Ns and 95% confidence intervals were **used **to evaluate the significance of these results. Results: Significant improvements in coping skills and strategies (overall d = 0.57), community integration (overall d = 0.45), and **depress**ion (overall d = 0.44) were observed immediately after telecounseling, with modest improvements in quality of life maintained at 12 months post-intervention (overall d = 0.37). Conclusions: The results suggest that telecounseling is an effective treatment modality for adults adjusting to a physical disability; however, further trials are **need**ed to establish the long term psychosocial benefits.  2011 American Psychological Association. eid: 2-s2.0-79953000887

65. **Telepsychiatry program for rural victims of domestic violence**
Domestic violence is a significant public health problem and is correlated with serious mental and physical disorders. Victims' fear and isolation seriously limit access to psychiatric **evalu**ation and treatment. Telemedicine provides a means to overcome these obstacles. This article describes a telemedicine program that provides psychiatric screeni**ng, e**valuation, treatment, and referral for ongoing care to clients of a **rural** women's crisis center. Psyc**hiatr**ic evaluation and treatment were provided t**o a r**ural women's shelter program using telepsychiatry. The shelter program had difficulty accessing traditional mental health, service. All new clients entering the program were screened for mental health problems. Those requir**ing f**urther evaluation received a physical examination with medical history and **initi**al psychological interview on site, followed** by p**sychiatric evaluation by videoconference. Appropriate treatment **was i**nitiated, and referral for ongoing psychiatric care through the local community mental health clinic was arranged. Of the 38 women referred for **mental health servic**es by clinic staff, 35 comp**leted** a psychiatric evaluation using telepsychiatry and 31 entered treatment. The most commonly identified disorders were anxiety and major affective disorders, followed by substance use disorders. Telepsychiatry can provide rapid crisis intervention and effect**ive mental health se**rvices to victims of domestic violen**ce in** a rural setting.  Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-27744481939
66. **Transcultural psychiatry made simple - Asynchronous telepsychiatry as an approach to providing culturally relevant care**
Objective: To examine the feasibility and diagnostic reliability of asynchronous telepsychiatry (ATP) consultations in Spanish and ATP consultation with Spanish-to-English translation. Subjects and Methods: Twenty-four interviews of Spanish-speaking patients were videorecorded by a bilingual clinician who also collected patient history data and gave the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders (SCID-I) to each patient. The ATP data (video of the interview and patient history) were forwarded for psychiatric consultation and a diagnostic assessment by the investigators. The ATP data were then examined separately by two Spanish-speaking psychiatrists, before being translated into English and then re-examined by two English-speaking psychiatrists. Agreement between the expert diagnoses of the investigators and the diagnoses from the Spanish consultations, the Spanish-to-English translated consultations, and the SCID-I results was assessed using kappa statistics. Results: We found acceptable levels of agreement for major diagnostic groupings among the Spanish- and English-speaking psychiatrists. Kappa values for diagnostic agreement between the expert and the translated consultations, the original language consultations, and the SCID-I were at least 0.52 (percentage agreement, 79%) and higher. Conclusions: ATP consultations in Spanish, and those translated from Spanish to English, are feasible, and broad diagnostic reliability was achieved. The ATP process allows for rapid language translation. This approach could be useful across national boundaries and in numerous ethnic groups. Cross-language ATP may also offer significant benefits over the use of real-time interpreting services and has the potential to improve the quality of care by allowing for the addition of culturally relevant information.

69. **Rationale and design: Telepsychology service delivery for depressed elderly veterans**
Background: Older adults who live in **rural** areas experience significant disparities in health status and access to mental health care. "Telepsychology," (also referred to as "telepsychiatry," or "telemental health") represents a potential strategy towards addressing this longstanding problem. Older adults may benefit from telepsychology due to its: (1) utility to address existing problematic access to care **for r**ural residents; (2) capacity to reduce stigma associated with traditional mental health care; and (3) utility to overcome significant age-related problems in ambulation and transportation. Moreover, preliminary evidence indicates that telepsychiatry programs are often less expensive for patients, and reduce travel time, travel costs, and time off from work. Thus, telepsychology may provide a cost-efficient solution to access-to-care prob**lems **in rural areas. Methods We describe an ongoing four-year prospective, randomized clinical trial comparing the effectiveness of an empirically supported treatment for major **depress**ive disorder, Behavioral Activation, delivered either via in-home videoconferencing technology ("Telepsychology") or traditional face-to-face services ("Same-Room"). Our hypothesis is that in-homeTelepsychology service delivery will be equally effective as the traditional mode (Same-Room). Two-hundred twenty-four (224) male and female elderly participants will be administered protocol-driven individual Behavioral Activation therapy **for dep**ression over an 8-week period; and subjects will be followed for 12-months to ascertain longer-term effects of the treatment on three outcomes domains: (1) clinical outcomes (symptom severity, social functioning); (2) process variables (patient satisfaction, treatment credibility, attendance, adherence, dropout); and (3) economic outcomes (cost and resource use). Discussion: Results from the proposed study will provide important insight into whether telepsychology service delivery is as effective as the traditional mode of service delivery, defined in terms of clinical, process, and economic outcomes, for elderly patien**ts with** depression **resid**ing in rural areas without adequate access to **mental health servic**es.  2009 Egede et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd. eid: 2-s2.0-65649118227
70. **Telepsychiatric care of American Indian Veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder: Bridging gaps in geography, organizations, and culture**
This paper describes a weekly telepsychiatry clinic treating post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among Northern Plains American Indian Veterans. The clinic represents a unique partnership of five different organizations, including two agencies within the Veterans Affairs Administration, a tribal veterans program, the Indian Health Service, and a university medical center. It is the first report of a telepsychiatry clinic targeting American Indians, as well as the first account of a telepsychiatry clinic focusing on PTSD treatment. A total of 50 telehealth clinic interactions occurred during the first 7 months, consisting of ongoing group psychotherapy, individual therapy, and medication management. Quality control measures exhibited a high degree of patient satisfaction and comfort with the clinic. Although the findings presented here are preliminary, this clinic represents a viable model for the delivery of telepsychiatric services. Future research is **need**ed regarding the process and outcomes of delivering psychiatric care by this means for **rural**, isolated, American Indians, as well as of the treatment of PTSD via real-time, interactive videoconferencing. eid: 2-s2.0-9644268751

The effectiveness of a prison telepsychiatry service was **evalu**ated from a user perspective. Forty-five inmates (41 male, 4 female) completed the Symptom Rating Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R) on three occasions, once before the teleconsultation and twice during treatment. The psychiatrist completed the Clinical Global Impression Scale - Severity Index (CGI) after each teleconsultation. Forty-nine per cent of inmates were aged under 30 years, 24% were aged between 30 and 39 years, while 27% were aged over 40 years. The inmates' mean SCL-90-R scores decreased over time, indicating less psychiatric distress. The psychiatrist reported patient improvement over time as assessed by the CGI.

73. **The use of videoconferencing for telepsychiatry in Finland**
Some of the first telepsychiatry experiments in Finland were carried out at the Department of Psychiatry of the University of Oulu, where videoconferencing has been used for family therapy, occupational counselling, consultation and teaching. In 1996 videoconferencing was used for a total of 249 hours, which increased to 434 hours in 1997. During 1997, 45% of the time was used for teaching, 26% for occupational counselling, consultations and therapies, 23% for training and 6% for administration (mainly testing the connections). In a survey, 37 participants rated aspects of the quality of the videoconferences on a scale from 4 (poor) to 10 (excellent). The audio quality had a mean value of 8.0 (SD 0.9), the picture quality 7.5 (SD 1.5), and the general value of the videoconference was rated 7.5 (SD 1.0). Preliminary results with telepsychiatry in Finland have been promising.

74. **A community-based approach to evaluation of health outcomes and costs for telepsychiatry in a rural population: Preliminary results**
A pilot trial was established to support visiting psychiatric services and local public and private practitioners through the use of videoconferencing. The purpose of the trial was to determine whether people in the community received better health-care with telemedicine. A community-based approach was used to **evalu**ate health outcomes, costs, utilization, accessibility, quality and **need**s for such services in a **rural** community in Queensland. Over a two-year period data were collected from 124 subjects who met the criteria of having a mental health problem or mental disorder. Nine further subjects refused to participate in the study. Only 32 subjects used videoconferencing to receive **mental health servic**es. Preliminary results did not show any significant improvements in wellbeing or quality of life, although the time span was relatively short. However, the results confirmed that the people were no worse off from a consumer or a practitioner perspective from using videoconferencing. Most consumers found that videoconferencing with a psychiatrist moderately or greatly helped them in managing their treatment, with 98% of them preferring to be offered videoconferencing in combination with local services. Overall, videoconferencing is a crucial part of enhancing psychiatry services** in r**ural areas. However, it is not necessarily cost-effective for all consumers, general practitioners, psychiatrists, or the pub**lic mental health se**rvice. eid: 2-s2.0-0000541859

76. **Future of telepsychology, telehealth, and various technologies in psychological research and practice**
It is increasingly urgent for psychologists to confront the difficult questions raised by the way that information and communication technologies are altering not only health care, but also the human experience worldwide. Whether psychologists embrace or resist aspects of technology, they should recognize how advanced technologies are changing the way we communicate and process information, anticipate **need**ed growth, and prepare to meet ensuing challenges to professional psychology. Exponential growth of technology is enabling new **mental health servic**es, extending existing ones, and augmenting options available to individuals for self-monitoring and decision making, both with and without professional involvement. Professional organizations can help retain psychology's leadership position by promulgating more specific guidelines and policy for science, practice, and education. Protection of clients already requires new legal and regulatory **initi**atives for licensure, referrals, client education, privacy, screening, assessment, record keeping, reimbursement, and self-help product **develop**ment. Protections for psychologists require new risk management procedures and adaptations by malpractice carriers as multidisciplinary teams evolve within and beyond health care into new public and private sector arenas. Key technologies that presage future trends include video teleconferencing, "smart" mobile devices, cloud computing, virtual worlds, virtual reality, and electronic games. Predicting change and adapting psychology accordingly will enable psychologists to future-proof their workplaces. Equipping future generations of psychologists and patients to collaborate more successfully in all potential growth areas requires educators and trainers to increase their focus on technology in graduate education, training, and supervision.  2012 American Psychological Association. eid: 2-s2.0-84874566521
77. **Provider barriers to telemental health: Obstacles overcome, obstacles remaining**
Many providers are hesitant to use telemental health technologies. When providers are queried, various barriers are presented, such as the clinician's skepticism about the effectiveness of telemental health (TMH), viewing telehealth technologies as inconvenient, or reporting difficulties with medical reimbursement. Provider support for TMH is critical to its diffusion because clinicians often serve as the **initi**al gatekeepers to telehealth implementation and program success. In this article, we address provider concerns in three broad domains: (1) personal barriers, (2) clinical workflow and technology barriers, and (3) licensure, credentialing, and reimbursement barriers. We found evidence that, although many barriers have been discussed in the literature for years, advancements in TMH have rapidly reduced obstacles for its use. Improvements include extensive opportunities for training, a growing evidence base supporting positive TMH outcomes, and transformations in technologies that improve provider convenience and transmission quality. Recommendations for further change are discussed within each domain. In particular, it is important to grow and disseminate data underscoring the promise and effectiveness of TMH, integrate videoconferencing capabilities into electronic medical record platforms, expand TMH reimbursement, and modify licensure standards.  2013, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-84896552508

This article descri**bes r**ural telepsychiatry clinics operated by the American Indian and Alaska Native Programs at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center through a partnership with the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Indian Health Service, and local tribal health services that target American Indian veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder. A six-stage model for **develop**ing such services is presented. The model consists of **need**s identification, infrastructure survey, partnership organization, structure configuration, pilot implementation, and solidification. This article traces prog**ram dev**elopment, presents challenges in implementing these services, and offers potential solutions. The model can gu**ide the** development of telepsychiatry services for American Indians specifica**lly a**nd rural populations in general. eid: 2-s2.0-23244454456
79. **Telemedicine services to a county jail**
Local and county jails rarely offer telepsychiatry services to their inmates. We have established a telepsychiatry pilot project between the Kansas University Medical Center and the Lyon County Jail in Emporia, Kansas. A total of 264 telepsychiatry consultations were conducted with jail inmates. Of these, 70 were **initi**al **evalu**ations and 194 were follow-up visits; only one inmate refused to be seen. Approximately one-third of all inmates were seen for psychiatric consultation within one week of their incarceration and 68% were seen within one month of incarceration. Among lessons learned during the first year of service were: the monthly demand for consultations was five times greater than projected; moderately to severely ill inmates with a broad range of psychiatric illness can be seen and treated effectively using videoconferencing; and the technology was accepted by the jail personnel and the inmates alike and integrated into the jail's routine in terms of the delivery of psychiatric care. eid: 2-s2.0-0002683929

A pilot study on telepsychiatry was conducted in which a videoconferencing link was established between a regional hospital and a care and attention home. Using this **system**, a psychogeriatric outreach team provided 149 psychiatric assessments to 45 residents of the care and attention home over 11 months. Videoconferencing was found to be highly feasible. It was acceptable to staff and patients and more cost-effective than on-site visits. Copyright  2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. eid: 2-s2.0-0035142336
81. **Benefits of a telepsychiatry consultation service for rural nursing home residents**
Psychiatric care for nursing home residents is difficult to obtain, especially in **rural** areas, and this deficiency may lead to significant morbidity or death. Providing this service by videoconference may be a helpful, cost-effective, and acceptable alternative to face-to-face treatment. We analyzed data for 278 telepsychiatry encounters for 106 nursing home residents to estimate potential cost and time savings associated with this modality compared to in-person care. A total of 843.5 hours (105.4 8-hour work days) of travel time was saved compared to in-person consultation for each of the 278 encounters if they had occurred separately. If four resident visits were possible for each trip, the time saved would decrease to 26.4 workdays. Travel distance saved was 43,000 miles; 10,750 miles if four visits per trip occurred. More than $3,700 would be spent on gasoline for 278 separate encounters; decreased to $925 for four visits per roundtrip. Personnel cost savings estimates ranged from $33,739 to $67,477. Physician costs associated with additional travel time ranged from $84,347 to $253,040 for 278 encounters, or from $21,087 to $63,260 for four encounters per visit. The telepsychiatry approach was enthusiastically accepted by virtually all residents, family members, and nursing home personnel, and led to successful patient management. Providing psychiatric care** to r**ural nursing home residents by videoconference is cost effective and appears to be a medically acceptable alternative to face-to-face care. In addition, this approach will allow many nursing homes to provide essential care that would not otherwise be available.  2010 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-76349109253
82. **Telemedicine--clinical applications in mental health.**
Video conferences and the Telepsychiatry applications allow for an alternative approach to service delivery in **rural** areas. They rely heavily on user support and access to a suitably wide network. The ISDN transmission medium is capable of excellent audio and visual quality, but the consequence of this high grade quality is higher transmission costs. Our experiences have so far been positive. No patient has refused to use the medium, nor has any patient walked out of an interview without returning. It is possible to assess patients with a wide range of psychiatric disorders from personality disorders through to frank and severe psychosis. It is hard to see how the **system** could be used for formal insight oriented dynamic psychotherapy, but there is no reason why it should not be used for review type case management assessments and consultations as discussed in this paper. The interviewing techniques used on Telemedicine require further **evalu**ation but are exciting and interesting, and can probably teach us a great deal about how we might improve our clinical interviewing style. The difficulties in providing equitable services extend beyond access to country centres. Low population densities and cultural diversity, typical for much of **remot**e Australia, demands an alternative approach for effective service provision. While video conferences cannot solve the inequity in service delivery, they can work as a useful adjunct to current service delivery strategies. eid: 2-s2.0-0029339961
83. **Use of videophones and low-cost standard telephone lines to provide a social presence in telepsychiatry**
Research findings suggest that the value added by the video channel of currently available video conferencing technology is limited to the creation of a social presence of the other party. Almost all clinical information exchange takes place on the audio channel, while the interpersonal interactions (nods, blinks, facial expressions, and body language), which are so important in a face-to-face meeting, may not be adequately captured by the video. Several of our case studies are presented which suggest that, consistent with the social presence role for video, low-cost videophones may be effectively substituted for expensive ISDN-based **system**s in many mental health applications. eid: 2-s2.0-0032427884
84. **Identification of the hikikomori syndrome of social withdrawal: Psychosocial features and treatment preferences in four countries**
Background: Hikikomori, a form of social withdrawal first reported in Japan, may exist globally but cross-national studies of cases of hikikomori are lacking. Aims: To identify individuals with hikikomori in multiple countries and describe features of the condition. Method: Participants were recruited from sites in India, Japan, Korea and the United States. Hikikomori was defined as a 6-month or longer period of spending almost all time at home and avoiding social situations and social relationships, associated with significant distress/impairment. Additional measures included the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Loneliness Scale, Lubben Social Network Scale (LSNS-6), Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) and modified Cornell Treatment Preferences Index. Results: A total of 36 participants with hikikomori were identified, with cases detected in all four countries. These individuals had high levels of loneliness (UCLA Loneliness Scale M = 55.4, SD = 10.5), limited social networks (LSNS-6 M = 9.7, SD = 5.5) and moderate functional impairment (SDS M = 16.5, SD = 7.9). Of them 28 (78%) desired treatment for their social withdrawal, with a significantly higher preference for psychotherapy over pharmacotherapy, in-person over telepsychiatry treatment and mental health specialists over primary care providers. Across countries, participants with hikikomori had similar generally treatment preferences and psychosocial features. Conclusion: Hikikomori exists cross-nationally and can be assessed with a standardized assessment tool. Individuals with hikikomori have substantial psychosocial impairment and disability, and some may desire treatment.  2014 The Author(s). eid: 2-s2.0-84921878511
85. **Autism spectrum disorders and autisticlike traits: Similar etiology in the extreme end and the normal variation**
Context: Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) have been suggested to represent the extreme end of a normal distribution of autisticlike traits (ALTs). However, the evidence of this notion is inconclusive. Objective: To study whether there are similar genetic and/or environmental etiologies behind ASDs and ALTs. Design: A nationwide twin study. Participants: Consenting parents of all Swedish twins aged 9 and 12 years, born between July 1, 1992, and December 31, 2001 (n=19 208), were interviewed by telephone to screen for child psychiatric conditions, including ASDs. Main Outcome Measures: Two validated cutoffs for ASDs, 2 cutoffs encompassing the normal variation, and 1 continuous measure of ALTs were used with DeFries- Fulker extreme-end analyses and standard twin study methods. Results: We discerned a strong correlation between the 4 cutoffs and the full variation of ALTs. The correlation was primarily affected by genes. We also found that the heritability for the 4 cutoffs was similar. Conclusion: We demonstrate an etiological similarity between ASDs and ALTs in the normal variation and, with results from previous studies, our data suggest that ASDs and ALTs are etiologically linked. 2012 American Medical Association.

New telecommunications technologies promise to profoundly change the spatial and temporal relationship between health professional and patient. This paper reports results from an ethnographic study of the introduction of a videophone or telemedicine **system** intended to facilitate faster and more convenient referral of patients with anxiety and **depress**ion in primary care, to a community mental health team. We explore the reasons for contest over the telemedic**ine sy**stem in practice, contrasting professionals critique of the technology in play with a more fundamental problem: the extent to which the telecommuni**cation**s system threatened deeply embedded professional constructs about the nature and practice of therapeutic relationships.

87. **The modified checklist for autism in toddlers: A follow-up study investigating the early detection of autism spectrum disorders**
Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) often go undetected in toddlers. The Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT) was used to screen 3,793 children aged 16-30 months from low- and high-risk sources; screen positive cases were diagnostically **evalu**ated. Re-screening was performed on 1,416 children aged 42-54 months. Time1 Positive Predictive Value (PPV) was .36 for the **initi**al screening and .74 for the screening plus follow-up telephone interview; values were similar for Time2 PPV. When separating referral sources, PPV was low for the low-risk sample but acceptable with the follow-up telephone interview. Children with ASD from the low-risk and high-risk samples were highly similar. Results indicate that the M-CHAT continues to be a promising instrument for the early detection of ASD.  2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC. eid: 2-s2.0-42649127380
88. **Psychological interventions during COVID-19: Challenges for low and middle income countries**
At the start of 2020, the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), originating from China has spread to the world. There have been increasing numbers of confirmed cases and deaths around the globe. The COVID-19 pandemic has paved the way for considerable psychological and psychosocial morbidity among the general public and health care providers. An array of guidelines has been put forward by multiple agencies for combating mental health challenges. This paper addresses some of the mental health challenges faced by low and middle income countries (LMIC). It is worthwhile to note that these are challenges at the current stage of the pandemic and may change with the course of the pandemic itself.  2020 Elsevier B.V. eid: 2-s2.0-85084129392
89. **Use of Tele-Mental Health in Conjunction With In-Person Care: A Qualitative Exploration of Implementation Models**
OBJECTIVE: Although use of tele-**mental health servic**es is growing, there is limited research on how tele-mental health is deployed. This project aimed to describe how health centers use tele-mental health in conjunction with in-person care. METHODS: The 2018 Substance Abuse **and Mental Health Se**rvices Administration Behavioral Health Treatment Services Locator database was used to identify community mental health centers and federally qualified health centers with telehealth capabilities. Maximum diversity sampling was applied to recruit health center leaders to participate in semistructured interviews. Inductive and deductive approaches were used to **develop** site summaries, and a matrix analysis was conducted to identify and refine themes. RESULTS: Twenty health centers in 14 states participated. All health centers used telepsychiatry for diagnostic assessment and medication prescribing, and 10 also offered therapy via telehealth. Some health centers used their own staff to provi**de tele-mental healt**h services, whereas others contracted with external providers. In most health centers, tele-mental health was used as an adjunct to in-person care. In choosing between tele-mental health and in-person care, health centers often considered patient preference, patient acuity, and insurance status or payer. Although most health centers planned to continue offering tele-mental health, participants noted drawbacks, including less patient engagement, challenges sharing information within the care team, and greater inefficiency. CONCLUSIONS: Tele-mental health is generally used as an adjunct to in-person care. The results of this study can inform policy makers and clinicians regarding the various delivery models that incorporate tele-mental health. eid: 2-s2.0-85084961417

Objective: The main aim of our research is to assess the use, satisfaction, and pedagogy of software for neuropsychological rehabilitation by computer, called "Gradior," to obtain relevant information on the impact of information and communications technology on people with severe and prolonged mental illness. Methods: To **evalu**ate the usability and satisfaction standards, the questionnaire "Usability survey on the use of the cognitive rehabilitation and assessment program by computer" was completed by 83 patients of the Rodrguez Chamorro Hospital. Results: The results of the study show that Gradior has 81.2% acceptance and 83.7% general assessment. This indicates that those who responded to the survey consider that the Gradior program improves cognitive functions and abilities in patients with severe and prolonged mental illness and therefore their quality of life. Conclusion: This research is oriented toward professionals of the Health Area and **System**s Engineers, who **develop** software for neuropsychological rehabilitation with neurocognitive deficit. The purpose is to make the learning process more effective among the people who use it and to improve usability for specific groups. We hope that the reading of the work contributes to the activities, techniques and materials planned are in accordance with the **need**s of the population affected with cognitive disorders.  2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-85084640524
91. **Ultra brief psychological interventions for covid-19 pandemic: Introduction of a locally-adapted brief intervention for mental health and psychosocial support service**
The ultra-brief psychological interventions (UBPI) was created in 2018 to empower healthcare providers with psychological skills that can be delivered within a short period. Techniques used within UBPI were adopted from a variety of well established psychotherapies and distilled into its core essentials. This enabled practitioners of UBPI to deliver specific psychological skills in the appropriate context to the client within a period of 1520 min. UBPI was also manualised to standardised training of practitioners. During the novel coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, UBPI was modified to suit the unique psychological demands of the pandemic. This article presents how UBPI was adapted and used with healthcare providers dealing with COVID-19 and also with the public who required psychological first aid (PFA).

92. **The Digital Revolution in Behavioral Health**
BACKGROUND: Technology is disrupting every modern industry, from supermarkets to car manufacturing, and is now entering the health care space. Technological innovations in psychiatry include the opportunity for conducting therapy via two-way video conferencing, providing electronic consultations, and telementoring and education of community health care providers. Use of mobile health applications is also an expanding area of interest and promise. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this article is to review the evolution and pros and cons of technology-enabled health care since the digital movement in psychiatry began more than 50 years ago as well as describe the University of Rochesters innovative digital behavioral health care model. METHODS: A review of the literature and recent reports on innovations in digital behavioral health care was conducted, along with a review of the University of Rochesters model to describe the current state of digital behavioral health care. RESULTS: Given the lack of access to care and mental health professional shortages in many parts of the United States, particularly **rural** areas, digital behavioral health care will be an increasingly important strategy for managing mental health care **need**s. However, there are numerous hurdles to be overcome in adopting digital health care, including provider resistance and knowledge gaps, lack of reimbursement parity, restrictive credentialing and privileging, and overregulation at both the state and federal levels. CONCLUSIONS: Digital health innovations are transforming the delivery of mental health care services and psychiatric mental health nurses can be on the forefront of this important digital revolution.

93. **The importance of external clinical facilitation for a perinatal and infant telemental health service**
Introduction: Clinical facilitation is an established strategy for introducing innovation into clinical practice. The Queensland Centre for Perinatal and Infant Mental Health has used clinical facilitation to establish a telehealth service to support perinatal and infant mental health in regional, **rural** and **remot**e areas of the Australian state of Queensland. The aim of this study is to explore the role of clinical facilitation in implementing and sustaining the telehealth service. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with** 14 r**emote-site users of the telehealth service. Interviews were analysed using thematic analysis. Results: Two dominant themes emerged: unmet **need** and service visibility. The study confirms the usefulness of telehealth as a way to address un**met **need for specialist **mental health servic**es in region**al, r**u**ral a**nd remote areas. The study also provides evidence that a telehealth service with intermittent demand requires a consistent clinical facilitator, to keep the service** visi**ble to remote-site clinicians and maintain awareness of the service as a referral option. Conclusion: Previous research has identified the importance of clinical facilitation in **initi**al service implementation. This study demonstrates the necessity of clinical facilitation for ongoing service provision. Facilitation is likely to be more important where the telehealth service responds to intermittent or infrequent c**lini**cal need, compared with high-volume services where clinics are conducted routinely.

94. **Veterans prospective attitudes about mental health treatment using telehealth**
The current study examined Veterans attitudes about the potential use of telepsychiatry for mental health treatment in routine clinical settings. Data were collected from Veteran outpatients (N = 253) who completed a series of self-report screening measures as part of their **initi**al **evalu**ation at an outpatient clinic providing care to Veterans with deployment-related mental health problems. Using a de-identified data repository, symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), **depress**ion, anxiety, and stress, as well as attitudes and level of comfort with receiving treatment through telehealth were assessed. Overall interest in telepsychiatry was mixed, with 25.7% of patients being not at all comfortable and 13.4% being extremely comfortable using telepsychiatry from home. Approximately one third (32.8%) of participants indicated a clear preference for telepsychiatry compared to in-person mental health visits. There were no differences in telepsychiatry preferences by symptom severity, demographic variables, **rural** versus urban location, or endorsed barriers to care. Although telepsychiatry may be a viable means of increasing access, patient preference should be considered, as a substantial percentage of Veterans in this study preferred in-person visits.

95. **Telemedicine and autism spectrum disorder in children and adolescents: Theoretical and practical guide [Tlmdecine et troubles du spectre de l'autisme de l'enfant et de l'adolescent: guide thorique et pratique]**
Objectives: The **develop**ment of telemedicine for children and adolescents is a real **need** because of difficult accessibility of mental health and the paucity of childhood psychiatrists. Thus the American Academy for Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP) published in 2008 good practice recommendations for telepsychiatry in children and adolescents based on clinical consensus and scientific evidence. In France the legal framework defines four practical modalities according to the presence or not of a health professional or a psychologist with the practitioner accomplishing the teleconsultation act. Data exist about the outcome of children and adolescents who benefited from therapeutic interventions with technological media. Effect size is modest but it doesn't justify ruling out these techniques. Children who present wit**h a dev**elopmental disorder or who cannot cooperate are **evalu**ated with a certain degree of uncertainty. By contrast, some children with severe Attention Deficit with or without Hyperactivity (ADHD), social anxiety or Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) can be more easily engaged within a teleconsultation model. Teleconsultations in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are feasible because of the nature of diagnosis and the type of care recommended in this disorder. The behavioral nature of the disorder and the behavioral therapeutic approaches recommended in North America culture highlight the potential interest of telemedicine because these disorders are easily observable. Literature suggests new opportunities in order to facilitate the care process for the ASD person and his family: the first one is diagnosis with use of validated instruments such as the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) and the Autism Diagnostic Interview (ADI). Parental accompaniment is the second oppor**tunity.** Development of telemedicine for ASD could be a complementary approach for diagnosis and medical care. Method: Since 2015, a program called PROMETTED (PROgramme MEdical de Tlpsychiatrie pour enfants et adolescents prsentant un Trouble Envahissant du Dveloppement) was supported by Regional Health Agency of le-de-Fra**nce. It** was developed and managed by the team of a Diagnosis Cen**ter E**valuation for Autism (DCEA) of Paris area in collaboration with a DCEA of le-de-France region. Five medico-social structures for children and adolescents with autistic disorders and the two diagnosis cen**ters **of evaluation for autism co-elaborated a scheme of intervention with telemedicine.** The ****remot**e evaluation is a 4-step process: a first teleconsultation structured around the medical history of the subject in order to complete his medical file and the observation of the young subject; a second teleconsultation structured around the ADI-R interview with parents; the third teleconsultation is a mixed teleconsultation associating the medical expert of the DCEA and a psychologist trained in the use of the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) and the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (VABS). The fourth teleconsultation consists of the psychiatrist giving feed-back to parents about the results of the observations of the DCEA team. Results: The four-step program is well-accepted and the use of validated instruments for diagnosi**s or **functional evaluation appears feasible. Medical data were completed for 44% of cases; complementary genetic or medical investigations were prescribed for 50% of cases; medical advice about psychotropic or vitaminic medication was given for 31% of case**s. Me**an duration of evaluation was 11.1 weeks  9.4. Conclusions: The PROMETTED program empirically validate**s the** concept** of r**emote evaluation for children and adolescents with ASD. **The **need to extend the use of telemedicine to tele-expertise for medicine monitoring or behavioral disorder management has been noted.  2019 Elsevier Masson SAS eid: 2-s2.0-85065535811

Background: Telepsychiatry has the potential to help address the uneven distribution of psychiatrists between urban and **rural** areas. While telepsychiatry has been used for several decades, employing video conferencing technologies to conduct psychiatry consults to the medical wards** of r**ural hospitals is a more recent application. Objective: To **develop** the first US program wherein psychiatrists covering the consult service at a public, academic medical center also delivered same-day consults to patients on the medical wards of unaffi**liate**d, rural hospitals. Methods: We describe the rationale, workflow, technology, case distribution, benefits, and lessons learned from the first 24 months of the service. Results: The program resulted in 156 **initi**al and follow-up consults wherein patient interviews were conducted via live videoconference. An additional 19 curbside consults were done via hospitalist-to-psychiatrist phone calls. Though **the i**nitial impetus for **the dev**elopment of the program was to manage involuntarily-detained patients awaiting the availability of a psychiatric bed, the availability of the psychiatrists resulted in the service being used for a wide range of situations and diagnoses. Conclusion: Given the benefits noted by consultants, patients, and community hospital medical staff, the program could be replicated by other institutions.  2018 Academy of Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry eid: 2-s2.0-85059526970

Context: Telepsychiatry has become a common modality for the provision of psychiatric consultations to patients in **rural** regions. Aims: The aims of this study were to assess and compare patient and provider satisfaction and perceptions of access to care with telepsychiatry. Methods: Telepsychiatric consultations were given by providers based on an urban tertiary academic health centre to patients located** in r**ural primary care clinics. Results: Patients (n = 110) and providers (n = 10) were both highly satisfied with telepsychiatry and both believed that telepsychiatry provided patients with better access to care. Paired patient and provider survey results demonstrated a high level of concordance between patients and provider responses. Conclusions: Concordance between patient and provider satisfaction may contribute to adherence and positive treatment outcomes. These results provide support for the use of telepsychiatry consultations to improve patient access to psychiatric **care **in rural regions.Contexte: La tlpsychiatrie est maintenant une modalit courante de prestation de services psychiatriques aux patients vivan**t en **rgions rurales.

Insulin autoimmune syndrome (IAS)is an uncommon cause of spontaneous hypoglycemia from hyperinsulinemia due to autoantibodies against endogenous insulin (Jian-Ping Chu, 2016). These individuals have no prior exposure to exogenous insulin. We report a case of a 35-year-old African American male, who presented to Vaughn Regional Medical Center in Selma, AL, after he was found to have seizures from hypoglycemia, with a blood sugar of 63 on presentation. He was never diagnosed with diabetes in the past, nor did he have a history of seizure disorder. He continued to be hypoglycemic during the **initi**al period of his hospital stay. His fasting insulin level was 27 mIU/l (normal is less than 25, with presence of insulin autoantibodies (IAA), and a negative workup otherwise. This led us to include IAS as one of our differentials for his hypoglycemia.  2019 eid: 2-s2.0-85066323409

101. **Telepsychology and video-interview [Tlpsychologie et visioconsultation]**
Telepsychology is an emerging field in present psychotherapeutic practices. There are different methods available to carry out psychotherapy at a distance. These methods more or less involve the participant's bodies. Videoconference is a technology that permits to users to see each other. This has an influence on interactions established at a distance. Video-interview is a method based on the adaptation online of the classical clinical face-to-face interview framework. Objectives: 1. Adapt the clinical interview framework online. Conceptualize a prototype device: http://www.ipsy.fr. 2. Compare the relationship between a patient and a psychologist during a face-to-face interview in a classical framework and on the online platform. Materials and methods: The sample of our study was composed of two groups of four participants. Participants were adults and did not have alterated relationship to reality. We compared the video-interviews realized with two groups of participants: one previously handled in a traditional framework and the other solely met through the platform. We used a qualitative method to analyze video-interviews recordings: a 12 items theme based grid. We were very attentive to ethical rules and data security all along the platform **develop**ment process and after that in the use of the device. Results: Psychological processes activated in the context of video-interview are similar to those observed in traditional clinical consults, for both groups of participants. These results also show the tierce function of the device in the dual relationship between the patient and the clinical psychologist. These results open a reflexion on the process relative to the creation of an intersubjective relationship in telepsychotherapy. It seems that the study of the sense of presence might be useful to understand intersubjectivity in telepsychotherapy and more generally in digital relationships. Conclusions: A methodological work is still necessary to define telepsychotherapy. This work should include an ethical dimension, in order to preserve online users safety. Telepsychotherapy has many advantages, for example, it permits a better access to psychotherapy for isolated people. These people can be isolated geographically, or they might have mobility issues, or even psychological issues making it difficult for them to go in the psychologist office. Present boundaries are technical, but also methodological, with the lack of def**initi**on of an ethical and methodological framework of telepsychotherapy in France. We also notice the lack of longitudinal, quantitative and qualitative data on **evalu**ation of telepsychotherapies efficacity. Also, some fundamental data should be explored theoretically, as the sense of presence.  2018 Elsevier Masson SAS eid: 2-s2.0-85042157143
102. **The small-world of cybertherapy**
Is cybertherapy a scientific paradigm? Is it made up of heterogeneous individuals or an organized scientific community? How has it evolved since 2006? To answer these questions, we took an interest in the keywords used in the scientific literature dealing with cybertherapy. A network approach has been put forward in order to (1) highlight the most central concepts, (2) to make some themes emerge, (3) to determine whether this structure could testify to a small-world organization, revealing paradigmatic aspects of a scientific discipline. 1510 articles have been extracted from the Pubmed and Elsevier databases from the query:  cybertherapy  OR "computer based therapy" OR "online therapy" OR "tele-psychology" OR "telepsychotherapy" OR  tele-mental health ". Over the period considered, (i) the conceptual network appears coherent and organized (S = 3.28), (ii) 18 themes emerge, (iii) the anxious disorders seem particularly central. The analysis of the temporal evolution shows an increase in the number of keywords which, combined with a reduction in the number of themes, makes possible to circumscribe the cybertherapy more than to promote its scattering. Although still above 3, the S-smallworld index decreases from year to year. All the results support an exemplary cybertherapeutic paradigm. However, the decline in the small world index over time invites us to ensure that this scientific coherence remains at the risk of a scattering of cybertherapy that could lead to an impoverishment of its identity. Ethical, methodological and educational implications are considered.  2017, Interactive Media Institute. All rights reserved. eid: 2-s2.0-85043790267
103. **Cybertherapy: A scientific model? A text mining analysis of published abstracts**
In the field of cybertherapies, meta-analysis reveal the scientific advancement in different fields, such as virtual reality exposure therapy for anxiety disorders [1] or the effect of immersive technology on user presence [2]. Certainly, knowledge about a phenomenon depends on results. But, following a socioconstructivist approach [3], it seems obvious that these results also depend on the researchers intentionality, which fluctuates with social, cultural, economic, political or theoretical circumstances. Researchers implicit models [4] also impact the design of the studies, the results and consequently, the scientific representation of the investigated phenomenon. One way to assess scientific models is to study publications abstracts. In order to observe the scientific models in cybertherapies and their evolution, we analyzed 857 abstracts from indexed Pubmed publications, obtained in January 2016 with the following requests: cybertherapy OR computer based therapy OR online therapy OR web based therapy OR telepsychology OR telepsychotherapy OR tele-mental health ". Following data-mining methods [5], we combined (a) classical approaches in lexicometry [6], [5], (b) the  Meaning Extraction Method  [7] and (c) network analyses [8]. We also crossed data with publications dates to observe the evolution of the concepts. Results will help us to observe the evolution of scientific models in cybertherapies as well as the evolution of concepts such as emotions or intersubjectivity.  2016 by Interactive Media Institute. eid: 2-s2.0-85019576426
104. **Acute laryngeal dystonia: A persisting psychiatric emergency**
Objective: Acute laryngeal dystonia is one of the most life-threatening medication side effects in psychiatry. It is rare and predominately caused by the use of antipsychotics in at-risk individuals. Within days of a patient's **initi**al presentation, several antipsychotics can be administered for the purposes of acute sedation and ongoing pharmacotherapy. In this case report, we describe a 27-year-old at-risk male, who **develop**ed acute laryngeal dystonia in the context of antipsychotic polypharmacy. Conclusion: Clinicians should take into account recent sedation and ongoing antipsychotic use in patients at risk** of dev**eloping acute laryngeal dystonia. Awareness of this condition and prompt treatment with parenteral anticholinergic medication can be lifesaving.

105. **Feasibility of Telerehabilitation Implementation as a Novel Experience in Rehabilitation Academic Centers and Affiliated Clinics in Tehran: Assessment of Rehabilitation Professionals' Attitudes**
Introduction. This study aimed to assess rehabilitation professionals' attitude toward implementation and application of telerehabilitation technology as a novel study in rehabilitation academic centers and affiliated clinics in Tehran. Methods. It was a descriptive cross-sectional study. To collect data, a researcher-designed questionnaire was **develop**ed. 141 rehabilitation experts participated in the study. Results. A majority of faculty members (78%) and clinicians (89.7%) either were in "definite agreement" or "somewhat agreed" with implementation and application of this technology, which demonstrates an overall positive attitude. Discussion. Based on the positive attitudes of the majority of participants toward implementation and application of this technology and their preferences in offering different telerehabilitation services, it seems that there is an appropriate and desirable acceptance and administrative culture to implement this technology among rehabilitation experts in Tehran. It is thus expected that implementation and application of this technology will be a promising experience in rehabilitation academic centers and affiliate clinics in Tehran.  2015 Sara Movahedazarhouligh et al. eid: 2-s2.0-84949238593
106. **A randomized clinical trial of home-based telepsychiatric outpatient care via videoconferencing: Design, methodology, and implementation**
Background: Healthcare providers are continuously challenged to find innovative, cost-effective alternatives and to scale up existent services to meet the growing demand upon mental health care delivery. Due to continuous advances in technologies, telepsychiatry has become an effective tool for psychiatric care. In 2012, the Institute of Psychiatry of the University of So Paulo Medical School started a randomized clinical trial of home-based telepsychiatric outpatient care via videoconferencing. Objective: The objective of this article is to describe the design, methodology and implementation of a pilot project, which aimed to verify the applicability and efficiency of psychiatric attendance via Internet-based videoconferencing in a resource-constrained environment. Methods: The project consisted of a 12 months follow-up study with a randomized clinical trial, which compared various quality indicators between home-based telepsychiatric aftercare via videoconferencing and face-to-face aftercare. Results: The final sample comprised 107 outpatients (53 in the telepsychiatry group and 54 in the control group). Among 1,227 realized consultations, 489 were held by videoconferencing. Satisfaction with the aftercare by videoconferencing and the medication delivery was high among patients. Attending psychiatrists were satisfied with the assistance by videoconferencing. Discussion: The experiences during this pilot project have overall been very positive and psychiatric outpatient care by videoconferencing seems viable to treat patients even in a resource-constrained environment.  2015, Lemos Editorial e Graficos Ltda.
