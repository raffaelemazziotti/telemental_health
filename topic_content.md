0. **A resident-based telepsychiatry supervision pilot program in Liberia**
Worldwide, attention to mental disorders lags far behind the staggering morbidity attributed to them. In low-resource settings, the majority of people with serious mental illness go untreated, and a major reason for this treatment gap is the worldwide **shortag**e of mental health professionals. In Liberia, this shortfall has been addressed by training and licensing nurses, midwives, and physician assistants as mental health clinicians (MHCs) via an intensive 6-month training program. This column describes a pilot program **util**izing senior American psychiatry **resid**ents to provide remote posttraining **supervis**ion to the MHCs via live teleconferencing.  2019 American Psychiatric Association.

1. **A comparison of on-site and telepsychiatry supervision**
Telemedicine has been used in **rural** settings for more than 25 years to provide services for patients and educational opportunities for practitioners. There is little documentation in the literature about using telepsychiatry for **supervis**ing psychiatric nurse practitioners. This article discusses **the supe**rvision **experi**ences of two groups of psychiatric nurse practitioners. One group of four nurses met weekly with a psychiatrist on-site. The other group of four nurses, working in three different clinical locations in Maine, met via a two-way interactive television connection with a psychiatrist based in Boston, Massachusetts.

2. **Psychotherapy supervision conducted via videoconferencing: A qualitative study of users' experiences**
The 70 h of mandatory psychotherapy **supervis**ion for psychiatry **resid**ents in Norway is designed to develop insight into the therapeutic **relationship**. Essential in fulfilling the intentions of psychother**apy supe**rvision is, for example, the ability to openly express and **util**ize personal **experi**ences, emotions, and reactio**ns. Six **supervision pairs - six candida**tes and **two supervisors - participated in a study to evaluate the **qualit**y of th**e psycho**therapy super**vision p**rocess when supervisors and candidates communicate by means of interactive audiovisual videoconferencing (VC). Each candida**te and t**heir respective sup**ervisors** participated in 10 supervised sessions, with 5 VC-based and 5 face-to-face sessions alternating every other session weekly. The part of the study reported in this article is based** on qu**alitative interviews conducted at the conclusion of the 60 sessions. The article concludes th**at the q**uality of psychotherapy supervision can be satisfactorily maintained by using VC (384 kbit/sec) for up to 50% of** the 70 **h of required psychotherapy supervision. The prerequisite for this estimate is that the pair in question has met face-to-face and establishe**d a relation**ship characterized by mutual trust and respect. The study further indicates that the limitations imposed by VC may, paradoxically enough, stimulate the development of insights and communication abilities that contribute pos**itively ****to th**e quality of psychotherapy supervision, also in a face-to-face setting. The most obvious implications of the study are the potentials provided by new technology for implementing decentralized models for recruiting and educating psychiatrists. eid: 2-s2.0-0031751739
3. **Training psychiatric residents and fellows in a telepsychiatry clinic: A supervision model**
Objectives: The authors assess the effectiveness of a specialized telepsychiatry training and **supervis**ion training model. Methods: Fifteen **resid**ents and eight child fellows rotated through Cedars Sinai Medical Center Telepsychiatry Developmental Disability Clinic and completed questionnaires of knowledge and self-assessed skills at commencement and completion of the rotation. **The supe**rvision was on site, side-by-side, and directive. Results: Both **the r**esidents and the fellows demonstrated improvement. Increase in knowledge was equal in the study cohorts**, whi**le residents' self-assessed skills were significantly greater than the fellows'. Conclusion: A telepsychiatry clinic appears to be an appropriate setting in which to provide** direct **supervision. Exposure to such opportunities early in training may yield a greater impact.

4. **Psychotherapy supervision face-to-face and by videoconferencing: A comparative study**
A **Shortag**e in qualified psychotherapy **supervis**ors in **rural** Norway motivated a study evaluating the **qualit**y of **the supe**rvision proce**ss when **supervisors and trainees communicated by interactive audiovisual videoconferencing (VC). Six **trainee **and supervisor pairs participated in five alternating VC based and face-to-face sessions. The pairs had previously established a good face-to-face **relationship**. Self-report data of **the qu**ality of communication, the alliance and disturbing **elements** in the supervision sessions were collected from specially designed questionnaires completed after each session. Independent ratings of the videotaped sessi**ons an**d qualitative interviews conducted at the end of the study were also conducted. The only significant difference between the two conditions was that trainees scored higher on disturbing factors under VC conditions. Recommendations for use of VC are provided in light of the findings. eid: 2-s2.0-0032776019

0. **Resident Evaluation of a Required Telepsychiatry Clinical Experience**
Objective: The authors explored **resid**ent **experi**ences of telepsychiatry clinical training. This paper describes an analysis of evaluation forms completed by psychia**try r**esidents following a required train**ing ex**perience in telepsychiatry. Methods: Retrospective numeric and narrative data were collected from 2005 to 2012. Using a five-point Likert-type scale (1 = strongly disagree and 5 = strongly **agree**), residents ranked the session based on the following characteristics: the **overal**l experience, **interest** in participating in telepsychiatry in the future, understanding service provision to underserved areas, telepsychiatry as mode of service delivery, and the unique aspects of telepsychiatry work. The authors also conducted a content analysis of narrative comments in response to open-ended questions about the positive and negative aspects of t**he tra**ining experience. Results: In a**ll, 8**8 % of residents completed (n = 335) an anonymous evaluation following their participation in telepsychiatry consultation sessions. Numeric results were mostly positive and ind**icated** that the experience **was inte**resting and enjoyable, e**nhanced **interest in participating in telepsychiatry in the future, and increased understanding of providing psychiatric services to underserved communities. Narrative data demonstrated that the most valuable aspects of training included the knowledge acquired in terms of establishing rapport and engaging with patients, using the technology, working collaboratively, identifying different approaches used, and awareness of the compl**exity** of cases. Resident desire for more training of this nature was prevalent, specifically a wish for more detail, additional time for discussion and debriefing, and further explanation of the unique aspects of telepsychiatry as mode of delivery. Conclusions: More evaluation of telepsychiatry training, elective or required, is needed. The context of this training offered potential side benefits of learning about interprofessional and collaborative care for the underserved.  2015 Academic Psychiatry. eid: 2-s2.0-84959335862
1. **Psychologist and Physician Interest in Telehealth Training and Referral for Mental Health Services: An Exploratory Study**
The current study explored psychological and medical professionals' **interest** in videoconferencing telehealth training and mental health telehealth referral. An online survey assessed 782 participants comprised of 669 psychological (45% male, Mean Age = 47.01, SD = 16.82) and 113 medical professionals (58% male, Mean Age = 46.19, SD = 12.40). Z-test analyses indicated that although psychological professionals were statistically m**ore inte**rested in receiving telehealth training, both groups report**ed some **interest. Ranked responses indicated efficacy data, ethical issues, and legal concerns as the most endorsed areas **of train**ing interest. Referral concerns were also found. Findings were discussed **relat**ed to both statistical and clinical significance. Application of findings is discus**sed r**elated to future work, practice, and program creation. The development of telehealth training progra**ms will **provide interested professionals with tools required for practice and may serve as an impetus to increase utilization and/or referral.  2014 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. eid: 2-s2.0-84905711312
2. **Connecting to the future: Telepsychiatry in postgraduate medical education**
Objective: This study characterized and examined factors influencing psychiatry **resid**ents' and fellows' **interest**, **exposur**e, and future plans to use telepsychiatry. Subjects and Methods: A 17-item electronic survey was distributed to 485 psychia**try r**esidency and fellowship programs in the United States. Each program director or administrator was asked to voluntarily distribute the survey to his or her trainees. Chi-squared tests were performed to test differences in proportions. Stepwise multivariate logistic regression was used to model outcomes** of inte**rest. Results: In total, 283 respondents completed the survey. A majority of responden**ts were **interested in telepsychiatry and felt that it was an important part of training. Of the 50 respondents who had clini**cal exp**osure to telepsychiatry and completed the survey, most reported that their **experi**ence incr**eased th**eir interest level, and two-thirds reported having either a one-time encounter or less than 6 h of multiple pati**ent ex**periences via telepsychiatry. C**linical** exposure to telepsychiatry was significantly **relat**ed to level of training (p=0.001) and program **locat**ion (p=**0.005**). Residents in their **postgradu**ate year (PGY) 4 or fellowship were 2.6 times more likely to be exposed to clinical telepsychiatry t**han P**GY 1-3 residents (95% confidence interval [**CI] 1**.41-4.95). Residents and fellows in rural programs were 4.3 times more likely to be exposed than those in urban or suburban settings (95% CI 1.07-17.28). Factors affecting trainees' plans to use telepsychiatry in their future practice include prog**ram l**ocation (p=0.013) and intere**st le**vel (p<0.001). Residents and fellows i**n rur**al locations were 9.3 times more likely to report future plans to use telepsychiatry (95% CI 1.88-45.71). Conclusions: There is** a pr**actice gap be**t**ween** r**esident interest a**nd resi**dent exposure to telepsychiatry. Training programs should consider incorporating a brief telepsychi****atry ****experience to fu**lfill bo**th resident interest and the growing demand for psychiatrists.  2013, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-84896551051
3. **Choosing psychiatry as a career: Motivators and deterrents at a critical decision-making juncture**
Objective: To examine factors influencing the choice of psychiatry as a career between **resid**ency program application and ranking decision making. Methods: Using an online questionnaire, applicants to the largest Canadian psychia**try r**esidency program were surveyed about the impact of various factors on their ultimate decision to enter psy**chiat**ry residency training. Results: Applicants reported that patient-**relat**ed stigma was a motivator in considering psychiatry as a career, but that negative comments from colleagues, friends, and family about choosing psychiatry was a deterrent. Training program length, limited treatments, and insufficient clerkship **exposur**e were noted as deterrents to choosing psychiatry, though future job prospects, the growing role of neuroscience, and diagnostic **complex**ity positively influenced choosing psychiatry as a specialty. Research and elective time away opportunities were dee**med r**elatively unimportant to ranking decisions, compared with more highly weighted factors, such as program flexibility, emphasis on psychotherapy, service-training balance, and training program **locat**ion. Most applicants also reported continuing to fine tune ranking decisions between the application and ranking submission deadline. Conclusions: Stig**ma, exp**osure to psychiatry, diagnos**tic com**plexity, and an encouraging job market were highlighted as positive influences on the choice to enter** psyc**hiatry residency. Interview and information days represent opportunities for continued targeted recruitment activity** for **psychiatry residency programs. eid: 2-s2.0-84905994899
4. **Defining competencies for the practice of telepsychiatry through an assessment of resident learning needs Approaches to teaching and learning**
Background: A foundational assessment of learning needs is missing from previous reports of telepsychiatry curricula. We used an in-depth needs assessment to identify specific skills required for the practice of effective telepsychiatry, and provide an evidence base to guide the development of telepsychiatry curricula in **postgradu**ate psychiatry training. Many of these skills set telepsychiatry apart from practice in traditional face-to-face clinical settings, or result from adaptations to clinical practice to meet the needs of a telepsychiatry interface in patient care. Methods: We used a qualitative, modified grounded theory approach to gain insight into areas of importance for telepsychiatry training** in postg**raduate psychiatry **resid**ency. 16 interviews of faculty **and r**esidents (9 and 7 interviews, respectively), allowed participants to reflect on their **experi**ences in telepsychiatry. Data were then thematically analyzed. Results: Interview respondents identified important aspects of the context for telepsychiatry training; the skills required to competently practice telepsychiatry; and the desired teaching and learning methods for acquiring these skills. Specific domains of competency were identified: Technical skills; assessment skills; **relat**ional skills and communication; collaborative and interprofessional skills; administrative skills; medico-legal skills; community psychiatry and community-specific knowledge; cultural psychiatry skills, including knowledge of Indigenous cultures; and, knowledge of health systems. The skills identified in this study map well to competency- based **medical educ**ation frameworks. Conclusions: Telepsychiatry is increasingly being adopted as a solution to health systems problems such as regional disparities in access to care, and it requires explicit competency development. Ensuring adequate and quality **exposur**e to telepsychiatry** duri**ng residency training could positively impact our health systems and health equity.  2016 Crawford et al. eid: 2-s2.0-84956888493

0. **Telepsychotherapy for trichotillomania: A randomized controlled trial of ACT enhanced behavior therapy**
Despite its prevalence, quality treatment for trichotillomania is often difficult to find. The use of telepsychology has been an effective method for disseminating treatment services for a variety of mental health conditions. However, no research has examined the use of telepsychology to treat trichotillomania. This randomized controlled trial used Acceptance and **Commit**ment Therapy Enhanced Behavior Therapy delivered by way of telepsychology to treat trichotillomania in adults. The study compared an **act**ive treatment condition (n = 12) to a delayed treatment waitlist control condition (n = 10). Results showed significant reductions in hair pulling severity from pre- to post-treatment compared to the waitlist condition. The 22 participants all received treatment and were combined to examine overall treatment effects from pre-treatment to a 12-week follow-up. The effect of treatment on hair pulling severity remained significant at follow-up. Measures of psychological flexibility and perceived shame also saw significant improvement. Quality of **life**, however, did not improve over the course of treatment. The findings demonstrate that telepsychology is a viable option to disseminate treatment for trichotillomania.  2018 Elsevier Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-85046370384
1. **Randomized controlled trial of a web-based Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) program to promote mental health in university students**
Objective: This study evaluated a 4-week web-based Acceptance and **Commit**ment Therapy (**ACT**) mental health promotion intervention for **univers**ity students. Method: Participants were randomized to intervention (n = 596) or waitlist control (n = 566). Assessment of primary outcomes (depression, anxiety, stress, well-being, self-compassion, **life** sa**tis**faction, and academic performan**ce)** and ACT processes (acceptance, cognitive fusion, education values, valued living, and present moment awareness) occurred at pre- and post-intervention and 12-week follow-up for intervention participants, and the same prepost interval for waitlist control participants. Results: Analyses showed significant improvements from pre- to post-intervention compared with waitlist control on all primary o**utc**omes and ACT processes. All intervention gains were maintained at follow-up. Improvements on all primary outcomes were mediated b**y t**hree or more ACT processes in both **sampl**es. Intervention effects were consistent across b**oth s**ample groupings. Conclusion: Findings provide supp**ort** for a web-based ACT mental health promotion intervention **for uni**versity students.  2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-85085357308
2. **Pilot evaluation of a web-based acceptance and commitment therapy program to promote mental health skills in university students**
Objective: This study evaluated a 4-week web-based acceptance and **commit**ment therapy (**ACT**) mental health promotion program called YOLO (You Only Live Once) for **univers**ity students. Method: A total of 130 participants were randomized to one of three intervention groups investigating varied program delivery methods. Primary outcomes assessed: depression, anxiety, stress, well-being, self-compassion, alcohol use, and **life** sa**tis**f**act**ion. ACT processes assessed: acceptance, cognitive fusion, education values, valued living, and mindfulness. Results: Improvement on the primary o**utc**omes and ACT processes did not differ among the three intervention groups. Analyses showed significant improvements on all primary outcomes (except alcohol u**se)**, and on all** AC**T processes. All ACT processes mediated changes on one or more primary outcomes in the intent-to-treat **sampl**e. Intervention effects were consistent on mo**st **primary outcomes and ACT processes across th**ree s**ample groupings. Conclusions: These preliminary findings prov**ide** support for a web-based ACT mental health promotion program **for uni**versity students.  2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-85050502026
3. **Web-Based Self-Help for Preventing Mental Health Problems in Universities: Comparing Acceptance and Commitment Training to Mental Health Education**
Objective: This study sought to test the feasibility of a web-based Acceptance and **Commit**ment Training (**ACT**) prototype prevention program cal**led** ACT on Colleg**e L**ife (ACT-CL). Method: A **sampl**e of 234 **univers**ity students was randomized to** ei**ther the ACT-CL website or a mental health education (MHE) website. Results: Findings indicated a lower level of user engag**eme**nt and satisfaction ratings wi**th **the prototype of ACT-CL than the MHE website. There were no significant differences between conditions on outcome measures at post or follow-up. However, statistical trends sugg**est**ed the MHE condition actually led to greater remission **of **severe symptoms than the ACT-CL condition among those with severe symptoms at baseline. There were no di**ffe**rences between conditions on ACT process of change measures. Changes in psychological flexibility were predictive of changes in mental health across conditions, but relations dissipated over time. Furthermore, great**er **engagement in some components of ACT-CL predicted improvements in psychological flexibility, though not on mental health ou**tco**mes. Conclusions: The effects of the A**CT-**CL program on mental health outcomes and ACT process measures were largely equivalent to those of an education website, although the**re **was a lower level of program engagement with ACT-CL. Findings are discussed in the context of feasibility issues and lessons learned for program revisions.  2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-84958680658
4. **Guided and unguided Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for social anxiety disorder and/or panic disorder provided via the Internet and a smartphone application: A randomized controlled trial**
Acceptance and **Commit**ment Therapy (**ACT**) can be effective in treating anxiety disorders, yet there has been no study on Internet-delive**red** ACT for social anxiety disorder (SAD) and panic disorder (PD), nor any study investigating whether therapist guidance is superior to unguided self-help when supplemented with a smartphone application. In the current trial, n = 152 participants diagnosed with SAD and/or PD were randomized to therapist-guided or unguided treatment, or a waiting-list control group. Both treatment groups used an Internet-de**liv**ered ACT-based treatment program and a smartphone application. Outcome measures were self-rated general and social anxiety and panic symptoms. Treatment groups saw reduced general (d = 0.39) and social anxiety (d = 0.70), but not panic symptoms (d = 0.05) compared to the waiting-list group, yet no differences in outcomes were observed between guided and unguided interventions. We conclude that Interne**t-d**elivered ACT is appropriate for treating SAD and potentially PD. Smartphone applications may partially compensate for lack of therapist support.  2016 eid: 2-s2.0-84991059235
5. **Rural Assertive Community Treatment and Telepsychiatry**
Assertive community treatment (**ACT**) is an evidence-based treatment for patients with severe and persistent mental illne**ss.** ACT has been shown to reduce inpatient hospitalization and is increasingly being used as a mainstay of evidence-based psychi**atr**ic practice for these clinical populations. The increasing implementation of evide**nce**-based practices has led to t**he **expansion of ACT in rural areas. Variability i**n t**he adaptation of ACT in rural areas has included accommodation by teams to multiple barriers. One way to increase psychiatric professional efficiency in rural areas is with telepsychiatry **and** possibly with rural ACT, but with unknown effects on fidelity and outcomes. Telepsychiatry has been considered a means of expanding** th**e reach of and access to ACT. Concerns abo**ut **the use of telepsychiatry by ACT teams include the psychiatrist's ability to develop a relationship with patients and staff and difficulties observing the patient's entire living environment via telemedicine. The Piedmont Community Services Board (CSB) Program **for** Assertive Community Treatment (PACT) serves patients in southwestern Virginia in collaboration with the Virginia Tech Carilio**n S**chool of Medicine. The Piedmont CSB PACT uses telemedicine to expan**d t**he **tre**ating psychiatrist's reach and contact with PACT patient**s, **increasing the efficiency of the psychiatrist's PACT time. Telemedicine is used for crisis intervention and augmentation of regular ongoing visits. The goals of this project were to mea**sur**e patient, staff, and psychiatrist** co**mfort and satisfaction with the use of telepsychiatry in ACT in addition to monitoring routine outcome measures.  2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

0. **Telephone-adapted Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction (tMBSR) for patients awaiting kidney transplantation**
Background Patients with progressive kidney disease experience increasing physiologic and psychosocial **stress**ors and declining health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Methods We conducted a randomized, active-controlled, open-label trial to test whether a **Mind**fulness-ba**sed St**ress ****Reduc**t**ion (MBSR) program delivered in a **novel** workshop-teleconference format wo**uld r**educe symptoms and improve HRQOL in patients awaiting **kidney transplant**ation. Sixty-three transplant candidates were randomized to one of two arms: i) **telephon**e-adapted MBSR (tMBSR, an 8-week program of **medit**ation and yoga); or ii**) a tele**phone-based **support** grou**p (tSup**port). Participants completed self-report questionnaires at baseline, post-intervention, and after 6-months. Anxiety, measured by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) post-intervention served as the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included: depression, sleep quality, pain, fatigue, and HRQOL assessed by SF-12 Physical and Mental Component Summaries (PCS, MCS). Results 55 patients (age 54  12 yrs) attended their assigned program (tMBSR, n** = 27; **tSupport, n = 28). 49% of patients had elevated anxiety at baseline. Changes in anxiety were small and did not differ by treatment group post-intervention or at follow-up. However, tMBSR significantly improved mental HRQOL at follow-up: + 6.2 points on the MCS - twice the minimum clinically important difference (95% CI: 1.66 to 10.8, P = 0.01). A large percentage of tMBSR participants ( 90%) practi**ced **mindfulness and reported it help**ful fo**r stress management. Conclusions **Neit**her mindfulness tra**ining n**or a support group resulted in clinically meaning**ful re**ductions in anxiety. In contrast, finding that tMBSR was more **effecti**ve than tSupport for bolstering mental HRQOL during the wait fo**r a kidney transp**lant is encouraging and warrants further investigation.

1. **Telephone-adapted mindfulness-based stress reduction (tMBSR) for patients awaiting kidney transplantation: Trial design, rationale and feasibility**
**Mind**fulness-based **stress** ****reduc**t**ion (MBSR) has demonstrated benefits **for st**ress-related symptoms; however, for patients with burdensome treatment regimens, multiple co-morbidities and mobility impairment, time and travel requirements pose barriers to MBSR training. Purpose: To describe the design, rationale and feasibility results of Journeys to Wellness, a clinical trial** of **mindfulness training delivered in a **novel** workshop and teleconference format. The trial aim is** to r**educe symptoms and improve quality of life in people waiting for a **kidney transplant**. Methods: The standard 8-week MBSR program was reconfigured for delivery as two in-person workshops separated in time by six weekly teleconferences (tMBSR). A time and attention comparison condition (t**Support**) was created using the workshop-**telephon**e format. Feasibility resul**ts: Kidney transp**lant candidates (N. =. 63) were randomly assigned to tMBSR **or tSup**port: 87% (n. =. 55) attended . 1 class, and for these, attendance was high (6.6. . 1.8 tMBSR and 7.0.** . 1.4 **tSupport sessions). Fidelity monitoring found that all treatment elements were delivered as planned and few technical problems occurred. Patients in both groups reported high treatment satisfaction, but more tMBSR **(83%) t**han tSupport (43%) participants expected their intervention to be quite a bit or extremely useful for managing their health. Symptoms and quality of life outcomes collected before (baseline, 8. weeks and 6. months) an**d after kidney tr**ansplantation (2, 6 and 12. months) will be analyzed for efficacy. Conclusions: tMBSR is an accessible intervention that may be useful to people with a wide spectrum of health conditions. Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT01254214.  2015 Elsevier Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-84927592826
2. **Mindfulness training for smokers via web-based video instruction with phone support: A prospective observational study**
Background: Many smokers are unable to access effective behavioral smoking cessation therapies due to location, financial limitations, schedule, transportation issues or other reasons. We report results from a prospective observational study in which a promising **novel** behavioral intervention, **Mind**fulness Training for Smokers was provided via web-based video instruction with **telephon**e-based counseling **support**. Methods: Data were collected on 26 low socioeconomic status smokers. Participants were asked to watch eight video-based classes describ**ing **mindfulness skills and how to use these skills to overcome various core challenges in tobacco dependence. Participants received eight weekly phone calls from a smoking cessation coach who provided gene**ral sup**port and answered questions about the videos. On the quit day, participants received two weeks of nicotine patches. Results: Participants were a mean of 40.5 years of age, smoked 16.31 cigarettes per day for 21.88 years, with a mean of 6.81 prior failed quit attempts. Participants completed a mean of 5.55 of 8 online video classes with a mean of 23.33 minutes per login, completed a mean of 3.19 of 8 phone coach calls, and reported a mean **medit**ation practice time of 12.17 minutes per day. Smoking abstinence was defined as self-reported abstinence on a smoking calendar with biochemical confirmation via carbon monoxide breath-test under 7 parts per million. Intent-to-treat analysis demonstrated 7-day point prevalence smoking abstinence at 4 and 6-months post-quit of 23.1% and 15.4% respectively. Participants showed a significant pre- to post-intervention incr**ease** in mindfulness as measured by the **Five**-Factor Mindfulness Questionnaire, and a significant pre- to post-intervention decrease in the Anxiety Sub-scale of the Depression Anxiety and **Stress** Scale. Conclusions: Resul**ts s**uggest that Mindfulness Training for Smokers can be provided via web-based video instruction wit**h phone** support and yield reasonable participant engagement on intervention practices and that intervention efficacy and mechanism of effect deserve further study.

3. **Mindfulness training online for stress reduction, a global measure**
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), **stress**-related chronic diseases are the main source of death in developed countries. During the last decade, e-mental health, telepsychology or telepsychiatry interventions are showing its growing potential due to the gradual global adoption of the internet and mobile phone technologies. A significant number of studies have concluded that **mind**fulness helps to **reduc**e physical and psychological symptoms** of st**ress related to various health concerns and that it is a psychological skill that can be trained. The purpose of this online research study is to gather the participants socio-demographics as **well a**s stress **and **mindfulness data during an** onl**ine mindfulness training program. Sustained attention and t**he s**tate of mindfulness experienced in single **medit**ation sessions are also tracked and stored. Correlational analysis yielded to a statistically significant relationship between hig**h scor**es in stress an**d lo**w scores in mindfulness facets (p <.001) and between state a**nd t**rait aspects of mindfulness (p <.01).  2012 Interactive Media Institute. eid: 2-s2.0-85019601802

0. **Impact of integrating psychiatric assessment officers via telepsychiatry on rural hospitals' emergency revisit rates**
Objective: To assess the impact of integrating Psychiatric Assessment Officers (PAO) and telepsychiatry in **rural** hospitals on their all-cause **emerg**ency **depart**ment (ED) revisit rates. As a pilot project, a full-time PAO was embedded in each of th**ree r**ural hospitals in New York State and was augmented by telepsychiatry. Method: A retrospective data analysis using ED census data obtained from the hospitals. The intervention group, defined as those patients treated by PAOs, was compared via a difference-in-difference method against a contemporaneous comparison group defined as those who visited the same EDs and had PAO-qualifying behavioral health diagnoses but were not seen by PAOs. Results: The intervention group was associated with an approximately 36% lower all-cause ED revisit rate during the **first** 90-day period (i.e. 190 days) following the initial PAO treatment (p = .003). A reduction of the similar magnitude (44%) persisted into the subsequent 90-day period (i.e., 91180 days since the initial PAO treatment; p < .001). Conclusion: The PAO telepsychiatry pilot program suggests a potential way to provide relief for overburdened** EDs **in rural communities that lack resources to treat patients with severe behavioral health symptoms.  2020 Elsevier Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-85082170593
1. **Emergency Department Telepsychiatry Service Model for a Rural Regional Health System: The First Steps**
Background: **Emerg**ency **depart**ments (EDs) have recognized an increasing number of patients presenting with mental health (MH) concerns. This trend imposes greater demands upon EDs already operating at capacity. Many ED providers do not feel they are optimally prepared to provide the necessary MH care. One consideration in response to this dilemma is to use advanced telemedicine technology for psychiatric consultation. Introduction: We examined a **rural**-and community-based health system operating 21 EDs, none of which has direct access to psychiatric consultation. Dedicated beds to MH range from zero (in EDs with only 3 beds) to 6 (in an ED with 38 beds). Materials and Methods: We conducted a needs assessment of this health system. This included a survey** of e**mergency room providers with a 67% response rate and site visits to directly observe patient flow and communication with ED staff. A visioning workshop provided input from ED staff. Data were also obtained, which reflected ED admissions for the year 2015. Results: The data provide a summary of provider concerns, a summary of MH presentations and diagnosis, and age groupings. The data also provide a time when most MH concerns present to the ED. Discussion: Based upon these results, a proposed model for delivering comprehensive r**egion**al emergency telepsychiatry and behavioral health services is proposed. C**onclu**sions: Emergency telepsychiatry services may be a tenable solution for addressing the shortage of psychiatric consultation to EDs in light of increasing demand for MH treatment in the ED.  2019, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-85059896853
2. **Evaluation and Implementation of a Telepsychiatry Trial in the Emergency Department of a Metropolitan Public Hospital**
Telepsychiatry via video conferencing is not new to mental health but has been expanding at a rapid rate over recent years. Initially it was introduced for treatment in **remot**e and **rural** communities, but it is now being utilized in larger health settings due to increasing patient demand and cost-effectiveness. **Emerg**ency **depart**ments are becoming increasingly burdened, as the workforce cannot keep pace with the rising demand of patient mental health needs. While telepsychiatry has been shown to have treatment efficacy, research is still relatively new, especially within **the e**merge**ncy de**partment context.  2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. eid: 2-s2.0-85029905979
3. **The symbolic affordances of a video-mediated gaze in emergency psychiatry**
While mental illness is a significant health challenge worldwide, the availability of specialists is limited, especially in **rural** areas and for psychiatric **emerg**encies. Although tele-psychiatry, via real-time videoconferencing (VC), is used to provide consultative services in areas that lack psychiatrists, there are a paucity of studies on the use of VC for psychiat**ric e**mergencies. We examine how VC matters for patient involvement and professional practice in the **first** No**rwegi**an emergency tele-psychiatric service. Through a decentralised on-call system, psychiatrists are accessible 24/7 by telephone and VC for patients and nurses in regional psychiatry centres. Based on 29 interviews with patients, psychiatrists and nurses, this article addresses how participation is fostered by VC, and how it may change the social dynamics of **thera**peutic emergency encounters. We identified four contributions of the video-mediated gaze in the therapeutic encounter including those of the: (1) immediacy of assessment, (2) increased transparency, (3) sense of access to the real expert, and (4) fostering of the patient's voice in therapeutic decisions. These VC inflections of the therapeutic encounter are a mix of the pragmatic (1 and 2) and the symbolic (3 and 4), assembling in these contexts to foster patient-centeredness. With a sociological approach to vi**deo-c**onferenced emergency psychiatry, the identification of symbolic affordances adds necessary nuances to the application of new technologies into fragile therapeutic communication.  2017 Elsevier Ltd eid: 2-s2.0-85037345227
4. **Use of Telepsychiatry in Pediatric Emergency Room to Decrease Length of Stay for Psychiatric Patients, Improve Resident On-Call Burden, and Reduce Factors Related to Physician Burnout**
Background: Our study aims to demonstrate through implementation of telepsychiatry for child psychiatry patients evaluated in the pediatric **emerg**ency room (PedsER); we can reduce length of stay (LOS) and reduce factors contributing to physician burnout through reduction of on-call travel burden. Introduction: Telepsychiatry has increased access to health care using real-time interactive videoconferencing, allowing clinicians and patients in separate locations to have a meaningful clinical encounter. Use has increased over the past several years given cost reduction and need for psychiatric specialty services in under-resourced systems. Materials and Methods: We evaluated data regarding child psychiatry fellow use of telepsychiatry through a prospective real-time questionnaire filled out by the on-call clinician from July 1, 2017 to December 23, 2017 (study period). LOS was measured from the patient's registration time through time of discharge. Results: Telepsychiatry significantly reduced the total monthly LOS for nonhospitalized patients in the PedsER during the study period compared to all prior months (285-193 h; p = 0.032) and compared to a similar prior seasonal time frame (329-193 h; p = 0.017). Telepsychiatry use reduced travel for face-to-face evaluations by 75% and saved 2.22 h per call day. Discussion: Unique in this study is enhancing on-site psychiatric consultation in **the e**mergency room, rather than solving a systems issue of referring out for psychiatric consultation. Moreover, this study uniquely demonstrated a noted improvement in on-call physician travel burden by reducing travel time with telepsychiatry. Physician burnout is notably high during residency training. Factors such as telepsychiatry can improve work efficiency and lend time to activities outside of work, mitigating the onset of this challenging issue. Conclusions: Telepsychiatry was shown to be effective in reducing dwell time and improving on-call burden. This study also showed promise in our system for improving access to other forms of specialized care consultation in PedsER settings.

5. **Telephone-based low intensity therapy after crisis presentations to the emergency department is associated with improved outcomes**
Introduction In Australia there is an overwhelming need to provide effective treatment to patients presenting to the **Emerg**ency **Depart**ment (ED) in mental health crisis. We adapted Improving Access to Psychological Therapies service model (IAPT) from the National Health Service (NHS) method for the large scale delivery of psychological therapies throughout the United Kingdom to an Australian ED setting. This telephone-based low intensity therapy was provided to people presenting in crisis to the EDs with combinations of anxiety, depression, substance use, and suicidal thinking. Methods This uncontrolled study utilised session-by-session, before-and-after measures of anxiety and depression via Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7). Results Of 347 eligible post-crisis ED referred patients, 291 (83.9%) engaged with the IAPT team. Most patients (65%) had attended the ED previously on an average of 3.9 (SD = 6.0) occasions. Two hundred and forty one patients received an average of 4.1 (SD = 2.3) contacts of low-intensity psychological therapies including 1.2 (SD = 1.7) community outreach visits between 20th Oct 2011 and 31st Dec 2012. Treated patients reported clinically significant improvements in anxiety, depression and suicidal ideation. Uncontrolled effect sizes were moderate for anxiety (0.6) and depression (0.6). Discussion The Australian ED IAPT program demonstrated that the UK IAPT program could be adapted **for e**mergency mental health patients and be associated with similar clinical benefits as the original program.

6. **Child and Adolescent Emergency and Urgent Mental Health Delivery Through Telepsychiatry: 12-Month Prospective Study**
Background: The significant gap between children and **adolesc**ents presenting for **emerg**ency mental healthcare and the shortage of child **and ado**lescent psychiatrists constitutes a major barrier to timely access for psychiatric assessment for **rural** and **remot**e areas. Unl**ike r**emote areas, ur**ban e**mergency **depart**ments have in-house psychiatric consultation. Telepsychiatry may be a solution to ensure the same serv**ice f**or remote areas. However, there is a paucity of studies on the use of telepsychiatry for child and ado**lesce**nt emergency consults. Thus, the aim of our study was to (1) assess patient satisfaction with telepsychiatry and (2) compare clinical characteristics and outcome of telepsychiatry with f**ace-t**o-face emergency ch**ild and** adolescent assessments. Methods: This is a prospective study of** tele**psychiatry emergency assessments of children and adol**escen**ts referred by emergency physicians. The comparison group was age- and gender-matched patients seen for face-to-face urgent assessments. Data were gathered on demographic and clinical variables. Telepsychiatry satisfaction was assessed using a questionnaire. Descriptive statistics and chi-square tests were used to assess group differences for each variable. Logistic regression was used to assess impact of the variables on outcome after the consult. A p value <0.05 was used to determine statistical significance. Results: Sixty (n = 60) assessments were conducted through telepsychiatry in 12 months. Among the telepsychiatry group, Aboriginal patients were over-represented (50% vs. 6.7%, p < 0.001), a higher proportion received a diagnosis of adjustment disorder (22% vs. 8.3%, p = 0.004) or no diagnosis (27% vs. 6.7%, p = 0.004) compared with controls. There was no statistically significant difference between groups on other clinical variables. Patients reported a high degree of satisfaction with telepsychiatry. Conclusions: Telepsychiatry is acceptable to patient**s and** families for safe emergency assessment and follow-up, reducing unnecessary travel to urban centers. Longer time outcomes are needed to establish val**idity** of telepsychiatry for emergency assessments.  Copyright 2017, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2017. eid: 2-s2.0-85031290037
7. **A transferable telepsychiatry model for improving access to emergency mental health care**
The Mental Health **Emerg**ency Care-**Rural** Access Programme (MHEC) aims to improve access to special**ist e**mergency mental health care** in r**ural and **remot**e communities in New South Wales. It provides a range of services in**cludi**ng emergency telephone triage and video assessment. The present report provides a detailed description of the structure and function of the MHEC model, and identifies matters concerning adaptation and transferability. Structure: the MHEC can be contacted 24 hours/day, every day of the year; no caller is refused assistance. Function: the MHEC provides information services, clinical services and other programme activities. Adaptation of the model and implementation elsewhere (transferability) should be informed by local needs, existing practices and the components of access. The programme has already attracted the attention of two other regions in Australia interested in i**mplem**enting emergency telepsychiatry programmes. The MHEC model is a practical solution for improving acces**s to **specialist emergency mental health care in underserved areas.

8. **No longer 'flying blind': How access has changed emergency mental health care in rural and remote emergency departments, a qualitative study**
Background: Mental health presentations are considered to be a difficult aspect of **emerg**ency care. Altho**ugh e**mergency **depart**ment (ED) staff is qualified to **provi**de emergency mental health care, for some, such presentations pose a challenge to their training, confidence, and time. Providing access to relevant and responsive specialist mental health care can influence care and management for these patients. The Me**ntal **Health Emergency Care-**Rural** Access Program (MHEC-RAP) is a telepsychiatry program that was established to improve acces**s to **specialist emergency mental health care acr**oss r**ural and **remot**e western NSW, Australia. Method: This study uses interviews with ED providers to understand their exp**erien**ce of managing emergency mental health patients and their use of MHEC-RAP. The lens of access was applied to assess program impact and inform continuing program development. Results: With MHEC-RAP, these ED providers are no longer 'flying blind'. They are also more confident** to m**anage and care for emergency mental health patients locally. For these providers, access to specialists who are able to conduct assessments and provide relevan**t and** responsive advice for emergency mental health presentations was valued. Assessing the fit between the consumer and service as a requirement for the development, evaluation, and ongoing management of the service should result in decisions about design and delivery that achieve improved access to care and meet the needs of their consumers. The experience of these providers prior to MHEC-RAP is consistent with that reported i**n oth**er rural **and r**emote populations suggesting that MHEC-RAP could address limitations in access to specialist c**are a**nd change the provision of emergency mental health care elsewhere. Conclusion: MHEC-RAP has not only provided access to specialist mental health care for local ED providers, but it has changed their practice and perspective. MHEC-RAP could be adapted for implementation elsewhere. Provider experience confirms that the program is accessible and offers insights to th**ose c**onsidering how to establish an emergency telepyschiatry service in other settings.  2015 Saurman et al.; licensee BioMed Central. eid: 2-s2.0-84928798574
9. **Assessing program efficiency: A time and motion study of the mental health emergency care - Rural access program in NSW Australia**
The Mental Health **Emerg**ency Care-**Rural** Access Program (MHEC-RAP) is a telehealth solution providing special**ist e**mergency mental health care** to r**ural and **remot**e communities across western NSW, Australia. This is the **first** time and motion (T&M) study to examine program efficiency and capacity for a telepsychiatry program. Clinical services are an integral aspect of the program accounting for 6% of all activities and 50% of the time spent conducting program activities, but half of this time is spent completing clinical paperwork. This finding emphasizes the importance of these services to program efficiency and the need to address variability of service provision to impact capacity. Currently, there is no efficiency benchm**ark f**or emergency telepsychiatry programs. Findings suggest that MHEC-RAP could increase its activity without affecting program responsiveness. T&M studies not only determine activity and time expenditure, but have a wider application assessing program efficiency by understanding, defining, and calculating capacity. T&M studies can inform future program development of MHEC-RAP and similar telehealth programs, both in Australia and overseas.  2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland. eid: 2-s2.0-84905643979
10. **The use of telepsychiatry to provide cost-efficient care during pediatric mental health emergencies**
Objective: This study evaluated a videoconference-based psychiatric **emerg**ency consultation program (telepsychiatry) at geographically disper**sed e**mergency **depart**ment (ED) sites that are part of the network of care of an academic children's hospital system. The study compared program outcomes with those of usual care involving ambulance transport to the hospital for in-person psyc**hiatr**ic emergency consultation prior to disposition to inpatient care or discharge home. Methods: This study compared process outcomes in a cross-sectional, pre-post design at five network-of-care sites before and after systemwide implementation of telepsychiatry consultation in 2015. Clinical records on 494 pediatric **psych**iatric emergencies included ED length of stay, disposition/discharge, and hospital system charges. Satisfaction surveys regarding telepsychiatry consultations were completed by providers and parents or guardians. Results: Compared with children who received usual care, children who received telepsychiatry consultations had significantly shorter median ED lengths of stay (5.5 hours and 8.3 hours, respectively, p<.001) and lower total patient charges ($3,493 and $8,611, p<.001). Providers and patient caregivers reported high satisfaction with overall acceptability, effectiveness, and efficiency of telepsychiatry. No safety concerns were indicated based on readmissions within 72 hours in either treatment condition. Conclusions: Measured by charges and time, telepsychiatry consultations for pediat**ric p**sychiatric emergencies were cost-efficient from a hospital system perspective compared with usual care consisting of ambulance transport for in-person consultation at a children's hospital main campus. Telepsychiatry also improved clinical and operational efficiency and patient and family experience, and it showed promise for increasing access to other specialized health care needs.

11. **Telemental health evaluations enhance access and efficiency in a critical access hospital emergency department**
Introduction: Mentally ill patients in crisis presenting to critical access hospital **emerg**ency rooms often face exorbitant wait times to be evaluated by a trained mental health provider. Patients may be discharged from the hospital before receiving an evaluation or boarded in a hospital bed for observation, reducing quality and increasing costs. This study examined the effectiveness of** an e**mergency telemental health evaluation service implemented in a **rural** h**ospit**al emergency room. Materials and Methods: Retrospective data collection was implemented to consider patients presen**ting **to the emergency room for 212 days prior to telemedicine interventions and for 184 days after. The study compared measures of time to treatment, length of stay (regardless of inpatient or outpatient status), and door-to-consult time. Results: There were 24 patients seen before telemedicine was implemented and 38 seen using telemedicine. All patients had a mental health evaluation ordered by a physician and completed by a mental health specialist. Significant reductions in all three time measures were observed. Mean and median times to consult were reduced from 16.2 h (standard deviation=13.2 h) and 14.2 h, respectively, to 5.4 h (standard deviation=6.4 h) and 2.6 h. Similar reductions in length of stay and door-to-consult times were observed. By t tests, use of telemedicine was associated with a statistically significant reduction in all three outcome measures. Conclusions: Telemedicine appears to be an effective intervention for mentally ill patients by providing more timely access to mental health evaluations in** rura**l hospital emergency **depart**ments.  2014 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-84903607877
12. **Agreement between telepsychiatry assessment and face-to-face assessment for Emergency Department psychiatry patients**
We compared psychiatrists' evaluations of **Emerg**ency **Depart**ment (ED) mental health patients made face-to-face or by telemedicine. In a 39-month study, 73 patients presenting in the ED were enrolled after initial screening. Patients were interviewed by a psychiatrist either face-to-face in the ED or **remot**ely by video. A second psychiatrist, acting as an observer, was in the room with the patient and independently completed the assessment. Based on the primary diagnosis of the interviewer, 48% of patients had a depressive disorder, 18% a substance use disorder, 14% a bipolar disorder, 11% a psychotic disorder, 6% an anxiety disorder and 4% other disorders. The raw agreement between the psychiatrists about disposition when both used face-to-face assessment was 84% and it was 86% when one used telemedicine. Using Cohen's kappa to evaluate agreement, there were no significant differences for disposition recommendation, strength of recommendation, diagnosis or the HCR-20 dangerousness scale. There was no significant difference for the intraclass correlation coefficients for the suicide scale. The results provide preliminary support for the safe use of telepsychiatry in the ED to determine the need for admission to inpatient care.

13. **Successful provision of emergency mental health care to rural and remote New South Wales: An evaluation of the Mental Health Emergency Care-Rural Access Program**
Objective To evaluate a **rural** **emerg**ency telepsychiatry program, the Mental Hea**lth E**mergency C**are-R**ural Access Program (MHEC-RAP), which aims to improve ac**cess **to emergency mental health care for communities throughout western New South Wales (NSW). Methods A descriptive analysis of service activity data from the introduction of the MHEC-RAP in 2008 to 2011 using Chi-squared tests and linear regression modelling to assess change and trends over time. Result There were 55959 calls to the MHEC-RAP, 9678 (17%) of these calls initiated an MHEC-RAP service (2500 each year). The use of video assessment increased over 18 months, then levelled off to an average of 65 each month. Health care provider use increased from 54% to 75% of all contacts, and 49% of MHEC-RAP patients were triaged 'urgent'. Most (71%) were referred from the MHEC-RAP for outpatient care with a local provider. The proportion of MHEC-RAP patients admitted to hospital initially increased by 12%, then declined over the next 2 years by 7% (by 28% for admissions to a mental health inpatient unit (MHIPU)). Conclusion The MHEC-RAP is well established. It has achieved acceptable levels of service activity and continues to be as used as intended. Further research is required to confirm how the MHEC-RAP works in terms of process and capacity, how it has changed access to mental health care and to document its costs and benefits. What is known about the** topi**c? Rural and **remot**e communities have poorer access to and use of mental health services. Telehealth care is a reliable and accepted means for providing non-urgent mental health care. What does this paper add? The MHEC-RAP is a practical and transferable solution to providing** spec**ialist emergency mental health care, and support for local pr**ovide**rs, in rural **and r**emote areas via telehealth. There is a possible impact upon the problem of recruiting and retaining a mental heal**th wo**rkforce in ru**ral a**nd remote areas. What are the implications for practitioners? Providi**ng re**liable remote access to specialist mental health assessment and advice while supp**ortin**g providers in rural communities can result in better outcomes for patients and services alike.

14. **Telepsychiatry in emergency consultations: A follow-up study of sixty patients**
The objective was to investigate how telepsychiatry works in the assessment of psychiatric **emerg**ency patients. Sixty consecutive patients referred to the acute open ward having their **first** psychiatric contact through the videolink with the psychiatrist on duty. Only minor technical problems occurred. The results suggest both acceptance and satisfaction on the part of patients and staff with new technology, instead of waiting for a consultation or traveling to see a psychiatrist in face-to-face meeting. Telepsychiatry seems to be suitable for the assessment of psychiat**ric e**mergency patients, and satisfactory for patients and staff alike.  Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-25844509864
15. **Telepsychiatry: An island pilot project**
A telemedicine link was established in 1996 between the island of Inishmore and the **depart**ment of psychiatry in University College Hospital, Galway. The link was mainly used to facilitate **emerg**ency consultations between patients on the island and the duty psychiatrist, always at the request of the island's general practitioner. Nine patients were referred for assessment in this manner over eight months. Three patients had their **first** psychiatric contact and assessment through the video-link, and were followed up as outpatients via the link to eventual resolution of the episode of illness and discharge at the outpatient clinic. Our experience has been that videoconferencing systems are acceptable and satisfactory for patients and staff alike. eid: 2-s2.0-0031610061
16. **A comparison study of the turnaround time for telepsychiatry versus face-to-face consultations in general hospital nonpsychiatric emergency rooms**
background: Psychiatric consultation services, particularly for **emerg**encies, are limited in many parts of the United States. Telepsychiatry services are helping to bridge the gap, and are gaining acceptance and popularity. There is paucity of publications regarding comparison of turnaround time for consultations between video conferencing and traditional face-to-face psychiatric consultations in general hospital nonpsychiat**ric e**mergency **depart**ments (EDs). Our study aimed to address turnaround time and patient satisfaction. methods: Data regarding the turnaround t**ime f**or emergency psychiatric consultations using telepsychiatry in general hospital EDs was collected retrospectively and compared with the time for face-to-face traditional consultations. A patient satisfaction survey was also conducted after the telepsychiatry consultation. Statistical analysis of the data was done after the study was completed. results: The telepsychiatry group included 206 participants and the control group had 186 participants. There was an 84% reduction in the turnaround time for telepsychiatry consults (95% confidence interval, 81% to 86%). A patient satisfaction survey showed 97% satisfaction with telepsychiatry services. Gender and age did not modify the effect of telepsychiatry on time to consult (P > .10). conclusions: The reduction in the turnaround time and improved patient satisfaction indicate that telepsychiatry services can improve the quality of care for patients** in n**eed of emergency services.  2020 Quadrant Healthcom Inc..

0. **Are There Other Options?: Child and Adolescent Telepsychiatry Services for Rural Population**
This study compared University of Missouri **child** and **adolesc**ent telepsychiatry services patients specific zip codes** to c**hild **and ado**lescent psychiatrists practice locations to learn if telehealth was an appropriate option for this group of patients. In demographically and geographically diverse state such as Missouri, patients in **rural** areas may have limited or no access to timely, affordable and quality care. Many large urban health-care institutions have turned to telehealth as a means of providing equal access to care for all population, no matter where they choose to live. The management analyst system Cognos/Analyzer was used as a data source. Patient- and provider-specific zip codes were processed using GeoKettle software, and ArcGIS explorer was used for map visualization. While patients ut**ilizi**ng ch**ild and** adolescent telepsychiatry services come from various parts of the state, providers are mostly clustered in urban locations along the Interstate 70. This greatly limits access to specialty care **for r**ural and other vulnerable populations. Telehealth provides adequate and timel**y acc**ess t**o child** and adolescent psychiatry services for the youth that may otherwise not be able to get needed care. Barriers such as mental health crisis and access to c**are f**or rural population have been more or less successfully addressed by telehealth for several decades now. However, the shortage of specialty physicians adds an additional layer of complexity to this issue. Health-care organizations with informatics tools such as telemedicine need to focus their efforts on maximizing usage to allow more access for the underserved population.  2016 Indian Institute of Health Management Research. eid: 2-s2.0-84977570445
1. **Exploring the Telepsychiatry Experience: Primary Care Provider Perception of the Michigan Child Collaborative Care (MC3) Program**
Background: Pediatric mental healthcare is a growing component of primary care practice. However, there is a lack of access to **mental health servic**es, particularly those provided by **Child** and **Adolesc**ent Psychiatrists. The Michi**gan C**hild Collaborative Care (MC3) Program is a telepsychiatry service that offers embedded behavioral health consultants within primary care practices, telephonic consultation, video consultation and embedded care. Primary care provider (PCP) utilization of telepsychiatry services is predicated on perceiving the consultation service as user-friendly, helpful, and feasible in their practice. Objective: A survey of PCPs was conducted over a 5-year period to assess PCP attitudes and perceptions regarding MC3 consultation, including measures of efficiency, user-friendliness, and confidence in providing mental healthcare. The survey contained 4 items, (2 quantitative and 2 qualitative), and took less than 2 minutes to complete. Results: 649 responses were received out of 1475 possible responses (44% response rate). Common themes elicited from the qualitative items included perception of improved patient care for youth with mental illness (45.3%), improved comfort and confidence in caring for youth with mental illness (30.9%), greater comfort with the prescribing and monitoring of psychotropics (25.9%) and improved access to mental healthcare for youth (23.1%). PCPs strongly agreed that MC3 was user-friendly, efficient, and enhanced their confidence in managing pediatric mental health concerns. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that the MC3 Telepsychiatry Program is well accepted by PCPs with self-reported improvements in providing mental healthcare to patients. Future research should explore how PCP perception impacts PCP practice, knowledge, as well as outcomes for patients and families longitudinally.  2018 Academy of Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry eid: 2-s2.0-85051084783
2. **Telepsychiatry in a Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Service**
Objectives: To carry out a survey on the use of video conferencing equipment by a **rural** **child** psychiatric multidisciplinary team and to determine what impact the introduction of this equipment had on service provision. Method: Several aspects were studied including user **satisfact**ion and estimations of cost saving, on the basis of avoidance of travel to and from the regional base in Galway. A questionnaire was also developed to determine whether alternative contact would have been made if if this new technology were not in place. Results: The results of the initial six months following commencement were investigated. Use of the equipment was attempted 17 times during this period. Most members of **the c**hild psychiatry team participated in its use. Visual problems accounted for 66.7% of reported technical difficulty and 88.9% of users rated their level** of satis**faction with the equipment as 'Satisfied' or 'Very Satisfied'. Conclusions: Apart from the start-up cost implications of installing this equipment, it satisfied its aim of increasing contact between **the r**ural service and St** Anne**'s Children Centre in Galway. The equipment was easy to use and for the most part reliable. eid: 2-s2.0-33750492301
3. **Translating Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Anxious Youth to Rural-Community Settings via Tele-Psychiatry**
This study aimed to determine the feasibility of translating cognitive behavioral therapy for anxious youth to **rural**-community settings via tele-psychiatry training. A 20-week group-supervision training program was delivered to ten different groups from different agencies within Northern Ontario. Each group consisted of four to nine clinicians with **child** therapy background not specific to CBT (n=78, 51% social workers, 49% other mental health disciplines). Clinicians were each required to treat an anxious youth under supervision. Changes in clinician knowledge and youth internalizing symptoms were measured. Northern Ontario clinicians showed significant gains o**n a c**hild CBT-related knowledge test (t<inf>(1, 52)</inf>=4.6, p<.001). Although youth treated by these clinicians showed a significant decrease in anxiety symptoms, possible response bias and the lack of a comparison group mandate further studies before generalizing our findings. Nevertheless, training local therapists in anxiety-focused **CBT f**or children via a group supervision based tele-psychiatry model appears to be a feasible and well-received approach to knowledge translation** to r**ural settings.  2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York. eid: 2-s2.0-84941258995
4. **Parental attitudes to a telehealth parent coaching intervention for autism spectrum disorder**
Introduction: This study examined the potential feasibility of tele-delivered parent coaching in a **rural** area of Italy through a survey of parents attitudes towards this type of intervention. Methods: Parents of all **child**ren up to six years of age registered with a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder at the clinic catering for the area were invited to take part in the study. The final sample consisted of 43 parents. Results: Parents with worse Internet skills and those who reported lower levels of **satisfact**ion with currently received services were less likely to be willing to enrol. There was a trend for parents with lower self-efficacy to be less likely to enrol. Educational level, previous experience of video-calling, travel time to the clinic **and c**hilds level of ability were not associated with the choice of enrolment. Discussion: Implications for strategies to contrast barriers to adoption and strengthen implementation plans are discussed.  2016,  The Author(s) 2016. eid: 2-s2.0-85018777751
5. **Supporting primary care through pediatric telepsychiatry**
This paper describes a pediatric telepsychiatry program serving communities in **rural** Ontario, Canada. Since the program's inception in 2000, over 4,300 direct clinical consultations have been provided for a variety of presenting issues. Indirect consultations and educational sessions have augmented clinicians' knowledge. Participant **evalu**ation of the program indicates that a comprehensive model of psychiatric consultation and education can be delivered effectively via live interactive videoconferencing to support primary care and to enhance capacity in remote, underserviced areas in Ontario. eid: 2-s2.0-62549160919
6. **Telepsychiatry with child welfare families referred to a family service agency**
A telepsychology and telepsychiatry service, using ISDN interactive video H.320, providing psychological consultations for the Family Resource Center in Farmington, New Mexico, was **evalu**ated. During the first year of service, 56 individuals participated including University of New Mexico staff, Family Resource Center staff and clients. Consultations involved **child**ren from families referred by **the C**hildren, Youth and Family Department (CYFD) in New Mexico. Telemedicine was used **in so**me child abuse cases. This study investigated whether the quality and acceptance of telemedicine consultations were comparable to face-to-face interactions in a group referred** by a** state child welfare agency. Participants received formal written consultation reports after the video conferencing sessions, which included a number of recommendations. Participants were asked to complete an anonymous questionnaire to rate various aspects of videoconferencing. The participants rated the university staff as involved, enjoyed the Family Resource Center staff's presence, felt the procedure was useful **for e**valuation purposes, found the format allowed for discussions of problems, and felt that the format was useful when compared to face-to-face consultations. The participants also said they had followed up on many of the recommendations. Videoconferencing appears to be a viable approach for providing consultation for families refe**rred **by a state child welfare agency. Several participants rated the session as both educational and consultative compared to simply therapeutic. eid: 2-s2.0-15344349269
7. **Using telepsychology to provide a group parenting program: A preliminary evaluation of effectiveness**
Telepsychology offers the potential to reach **rural** and underserved **child**ren and families with mental health concerns. The current study **evalu**ated the effects of using videoconferencing technology to deliver an evidence-based parenting program, the Group Triple P Positive Parenting Program (Group Triple P; Turner, Markie-Dadds, & Sanders, 2002), with families who ha**d a c**hild experiencing behavioral problems. Using a pre/post design, families (N = 13) from low socioeconomic backgrounds in Kentucky completed the Group Triple P via a videoconferencing delivery format. A benchmarking strategy (Weersing & Hamilton, 2005) indicated that treatment effect sizes for the videoconferencing format were generally comparable to treatment effect sizes for Group Triple P studies conducted in-person. Specif**icall**y, child behavior and parenting outcomes were similar across delivery formats. Implications of the study's findings and future directions for telepsychology research and practice with underserved f**amili**es and children are discussed.  2015 American Psychological Association. eid: 2-s2.0-84938206433
8. **Mental health services for Nunavut children and youth: Evaluating a telepsychiatry pilot project**
Introduction: This study examines the delivery of psychiatric consultation services using videoconferencing technology to health and mental health workers in the Nunavut territory of Canada. The research provides insights into the TeleLink Mental Health Program and the delivery of professional-to-professional program consultations and continuing education seminars. Methods: Participant observation of 12 program consultations and four continuing education sessions was conducted. Individual interviews were conducted with the consulting psychiatrist and the lead program coordinator in Nunavut. As well, a focus group was held with Nunavut workers who participated in the televideo sessions. Results: The study found a number of factors that facilitated or hindered the process and content of a consultation-based telepsychiatry program and its effect on building capacity among frontline staff. Four main themes emerged related to the delivery of psychiatric services via televideo: gaining access, ensuring culturally appropriate services, providing relevant continuing education, and offering stable and confidential technology. Conclusions: Live interactive videoconferencing technology is an innovative and effective way of delivering specialized **mental health servic**es to professionals working in remote areas of Nunavut. Study results provide important strategies for expanding this approach to other jurisdictions in Nunavut and other Inuit regions.  T Volpe, KM Boydell, A Pignatiello, 2014. eid: 2-s2.0-84904618501
9. **Attracting child psychiatrists to a televideo consultation service: The telelink experience**
Objective. Identify aspects of psychiatry work that are rewarding, as well as those that are challenging, from the perspective of psychiatrists and residents participating in televideo consultation services. Method. A web-based survey was distributed to psychiatrists within the Division of **Child** Psychiatry at the University of Toronto. Also, semistructured interviews were conducted with **six c**hild psychiatrists providing services to a telepsychiatry program. Finally, a focus group interview was held with four psychiatry residents. R**esult**s. **Child psychiatri**sts are very comfortable conducting assessments via televideo. Factors identified as being important in the decision to participate in telepsychiatry include assisting underserved communities, supportive administrative staff, enhanced **rural** provider capacity, financial incentives, and convenience. The study's qualitative phase identified four themes in the decision to participate in telepsychiatry: (1) organizational, (2) shared values, (3) innovation, and (4) the consultation model. Conclusion. The success of televideo consultation programs in** attr**act**ing child psychi**atrists to provide consultation services to underresourced communities makes an important contribution to psychiatric workforce shortages. Understanding what aspects of telepsychiatry are most appreciated by consulting psychiatrists and residents offers useful strategies to telepsychiatry administrators and medical school educators seeking to attract, train, and retain psychiatry practitioners.  2013 Tiziana Volpe et al. eid: 2-s2.0-84880149736
10. **Telepsychiatry improves paediatric behavioural health care in rural communities**
In the US, **child**ren with special health care needs are underserved by both the medical and educational systems. This problem is especially serious in **rural** states. Telemedicine is a technique that can reduce these gaps in service and help connect the two systems. The technology required has become cheaper and more accessible. Progress on reimbursement for such services has also been made. For some years, we have provided telepsychiatry **for c**hildren in Washington State using videoconferencing. Interviews with families and service providers were conducted in Washington and Missouri. Some parents reported tha**t the**ir child actually preferred telepsychiatry to conventional consultation. The telepsychiatry service model was built on the existing system of outreach clinics, thus involving specialists who were familiar with the community and who were known and trusted by the community. Before starting, we ensured that all relevant service delivery agencies and providers were comfortable about using videoconferencing as a method of service delivery. In the 18-month period ending in March 2003, three providers in Seattle saw 159 patients by telepsychiatry and 210 patients face-to-face at the hospital clinic. The main barrier to further growth of the telepsychiatry service is the absence of reimbursement for telepsychiatry. eid: 2-s2.0-34548040642
11. **Weight status of children and adolescents in a telepsychiatry clinic**
The prevalence of overweight and obesity is approximately 32% among **child**ren and **adolesc**ents in the United States. Comorbid conditions associated with pediatric overweight and obesity include psychiatric conditions. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of overweight and obesity am**ong c**hildren **and ado**lescents presenting for consultation from **rural** communities to the UC Davis Telemedicine Program (UCDTP), as well as to collect preliminary data to design an integrated disease management prog**ram f**or child**ren and** adolescents with obesity and mental illness. Patients aged 21 and under seen for psychiatric consultation at the UCDTP between 2004 and 2006 were included. Retrospective medical record review was conducted to determine the major psychiatric diagnoses, height, weight, body-mass index, and weight status (underweight/at risk for underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese) for each patient. Of the 230 patients referred, a total of 121 patients had both height and weight values documented. Three patients were underweight; 51 were normal weight; 28 were overweight; 39 were obese. The most common psychiatric diagnoses in the 121 patients were attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; n=40), bipolar disorder (n=36), and depression (n=31). The most common psychiatric diagnoses in patients with available weight and height data who were overweight and obese were bipolar disorder (n=20), depression (n=18), and ADHD (n=17). Approxima**tely **55% o**f child** and adolescent patients seen for telepsychiatry consultation whose charts documented height and weight measurements were overweight or obese. Psychiatric diagnoses in overweight youngsters need to be researched further to determine whether the weight change is primary or secondary to mood and/or to treatments, such as medication. At such a high rate of comorbidity, monitoring the weight status of young psychiatric patients in this population is indicated.  2009, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-74249085171
12. **E-CYMHS: An expansion of a child and youth telepsychiatry model in Queensland**
Objectives: The purpose of this study was to describe the evolution of the E-**Child** and Youth **Mental Health Servic**e (E-CYMHS), which supports regional and **rura**l** mental health se**rvices by providing access to consult**ant c**hild and **adolesc**ent psychiatrists to isolated staff in regional areas, where access to specialist psychiatric services is limited. Conclusions: E-CYMHS provides a level of parity in mental health care between metropolitan, regional and remote services through the provision of regular videoconferencing servic**es wi**th child **and ado**lescent psychiatrists and senior allied health clinicians. The three key features which underpin the success of the service are: 1. A central co-ordinator of services; 2. Provision of support outside regular videoconference times; and 3. Routine outreach visits that foster community capacity-building. E-CYMHS has been well received by the r**egional mental healt**h services it supports, and the total provision of services has more than doubled over the last three years. It is anticipated that as telepsychiatry is increasingly viewed as a credible alternative to traditional means of patient care, this trend is likely to continue.  2012 The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists. eid: 2-s2.0-84872155638
13. **Teleconferencing model for forensic consultation, court testimony, and continuing education**
A medical center-based forensic clinic that provides the necessary comprehensive consultation, continuing education, court testimony, and clinical services through an applied model of teleconferencing applications is addressed. Telemedicine technology and services have gained the attention of both legal and clinical practitioners, examining trends and models of health care for underserved populations, and identifying where consultation with a team of professionals may benefit service providers in **rural** communities. The contribution offered herein provides an understanding of the history of the development of the clinic, a theoretical model that has been applied to a clinical forensic program that employs telepsychiatry services, and the ethical and malpractice liability issues confronted in using teleconferencing services. This model is examined through a **child** and **adolesc**ent forensic **evalu**ation clinic. The goals of this model are offered, as are a number of applications within the broad spectrum of services utilizing telemedicine. Finally, changing patterns are addressed in clinically based health-care delivery for criminal justice, social services, and forensic mental health.

14. **Ten-year experience of a private nonprofit telepsychiatry service**
This paper reports the results of a **satisfact**ion survey of telepsychiatry patients at a **rural** community mental health clinic that had been providing psychiatric services solely via telemedicine for 10 years. The survey examined the perceived telepsychiatric session quality over a relatively long period of time with patients who had been utilizing the services for a number of years or over multiple sessions. Onepage optional anonymous surveys were distributed from December 1, 2006, through March 30, 2007, covering 230 telepsychiatry patients, approximately 90% of current telepsychiatry patients at the agency. Of these, 76 patients responded, a 33.0% return rate. Among the responden**ts, satis**faction was generally very high, with telemedicine services provided over a period of up to 10 years perceived to be of similar (no worse) quality than in-person services. Results were further analyzed by gender, age, and number of telemedicine sessions experienced. Female patients appeared more accepting of the quality of medical care via telemedicine than male patients. Patients aged 20-49 had much higher acceptance rates than patients younger than 20 or older than 49. The least positive responses toward telemedicine were from patients in their 50s. Patients who had experienced 5 to 10 telemedicine sessions were more likely than patients who had experienced fewer than 5 to report that their sessions now run more smoothly than their initial sessions. Patients in their 20s and 30s reported the least need to have a clinician in the room with them to make them feel comfortable during their telemedicine sessions. Eight percent of respondents reacted negatively to the presence of a clinician in the room with them during their telemedicine sessions.

15. **The experience in Victoria with telepsychiatry for the child and adolescent mental health service**
In 1995, the Royal **Child**ren's Hospital **Mental Health Servic**e in Melbourne developed the first telepsychiatry programme** in c**hild and **adolesc****ent mental health se**rvices (CAMHS) in Australia. A survey of 25 CAMHS clinicians in five **rural** regions who had used videoconferencing showed that 64% had used the technology for more than 18 months, and 20% had used it for 7-12 months. Also, 60% had used the technology on over 30 occasions, and 24% had used it on 20-29 occasions. Respondents clearly recognized its benefits in terms of their increased knowledge and skills (96%), strengthening of relationships with colleagues (92%) and decreased sense of isolation (92%). To build on the success of telepsychiatry there are a number of challenges that health service managers will need to address. Telepsychiatry works most effectively as a tool to complement face-to-face contact. It cannot be promoted as the total solution to the issue of isolation from mainstream services. eid: 2-s2.0-0035232380
16. **Establishing a telepsychiatry consultation practice in rural Georgia for primary care physicians: A feasibility report**
Objective. One approach to solving mental health care disparity issues in **rural** areas is by establishing a telepsychiatry consultation practice for **child**ren, in which a psychiatrist see**s a c**hild via videoconferencing for a limited number of sessions and then provides a treatment plan **to th**at child's primary care physician and family. Method. The present study offered a 2-session telepsychiatry consultation clinic, consisting of a psychiatric **evalu**ation session and a recommendation session, with patients located remotely** in r**ural Georgia. Results. Fifteen consult**ation**s with children aged 4 to 18 years (M = 9.73, SD = 3.39) with varying diagnoses were completed. Parental **satisfact**ion with the telepsychiatry consultation model was high, overall mean of 4.58 (SD = 0.63) on a 5-point scale (n = 11).

The **Child** and **Adolesc**ent Psychological Telemedicine Outreach Service (CAPTOS) in Sydney has been providing telepsychiatry services in New South Wales (NSW) for ten years. Services are provided to over 40 sites in remote and **rural** NSW. There are eight telepsychiatry clinics a week, providing almost 600 consultations a year. As well as telepsychiatry, three additional services are provided: professional supervision, education and training, and Aborigi**nal c**hild **and ado**lescent mental health traineeships. The service was re-**evalu**ated in 2004 using a semi-structured interview to obtain information about service **satisfact**ion and effectiveness from hub **and r**ural clinicians. There continues to be a high level** of satis**faction with the telepsychiatry service and with other telemedicine services, such as clinical supervision and teaching.

18. **Assessment of SUNY Upstate medical university's child telepsychiatry consultation program**
Objectives: The project assesses the **child** telepsychiatry services provided by SUNY Upstate psychiatrists to several county mental health clinics in central New York State. Method: Data for 45 patients was extracted from pre-consultation forms completed by the referring clinic and postconsultation summaries completed by the Upstate psychiatrists that occurred between July 13, 2009 and May 12, 2010. The study identified characteristics of patients for whom telepsychiatry consultations were sought, why they were sought, and reviewed recommended changes in therapy and medication provided by the telepsychiatry consultant. Results: Analysis of the data showed that there was a large variation in patient characteristics such as age (from age 3 to 17), current living situation, and psychological symptoms. In addition to a family history of mental illness (80%), the most common symptoms were physical aggression (60.0%), defiant/oppositional behavior (57.8%), and attentional problems (55.6%). The most common reason for referral was diagnostic clarification (67%). **The c**hild telepsychiatrist recommended a change in medication for most (80.8%) of the patients who were on medications, and to begin medications for most (63.2%) who were not receiving medication at the time of consult. Further, the telepsychiatrist often recommended the addition of family therapy (71.1%) and counseling at school (17.8%). Conclusi**on: T**he child telepsychiatric program at Upstate seemed effective. It reached a large** vari**ety of children with significant mental disorders. The consultants provided diagnostic clarification and recommended modification of treatment for most. However, this assessment is limited as examined as it did not include follow-up information on whether consultant recommendations were followed and, if they were, whether they were effective.  2011, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-81755188307
19. **A statewide child telepsychiatry consult system yields desired health system changes and savings**
Background: Telepsychiatry has clinical efficacy with **child**ren, but questions remain about cost-effectiveness. State agencies and health systems need to know i**f a c**hild telepsychiatry consult system can address system concerns and improve care quality while lowering costs. Materials and Methods: To assist care in a **rural** state w**ith f**ew child and **adolesc**ent psychiatrists, an academic center coordinated a consult system of (1) televideo consults for** high**-needs children with Medicaid and state Multidisciplinary Team (MDT)/foster care involvement, (2) remote medication reviews for beyond guidelines prescribing, and (3) elective community provider telephone-based consults. Consult service data were collected and analyzed with Wyoming's Medicaid and Foster Care Divisions between the program start in January 2011 until March 2013. Results: There were 229 televideo MDT/foster care consults, 125 mandatory medication reviews, and 277 elective phone consultations supporting community providers during this period. Following implementation, the num**ber o**f Medicaid children 5 years of age using psychotropic medications decreased by 42% (p<0.001)**, and** the number of children using psychotropic doses >150% of the Food and Drug Administration maximum decreased by 52% (p<0.001). Televideo con**sults** redirected 60% of children slated by caseworkers for a psychiatric residential treatment facility admission into alternative community treatment and placements. A financial return on investment was 1.82 to 1 for combined services. Co**nclus**ions: This coordinated child telepsychiatry consult system for a state Medicaid division reduced outlier pediatric psychiatric medication prescribing, supported local community-delivered treatments, and reduced unnecessary hospitalizations in a financially advantageous manner that was well received by the practice community.  2015, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-84936936665
20. **Improved access to mental health evaluation for patients with developmental disabilities using telepsychiatry**
The Cedars-Sinai Telepsychiatry Clinic uses a collaborative-care model to treat patients with developmental disabilities. We examined its practice in four areas: patient characteristics, clinical care, symptom severity and diagnostic outcomes to describe the care provided and the population seen in the telepsychiatry clinic. In a chart review, 45 out of 126 cases were selected and **evalu**ated at three times: init**ial e**valuation, year one and year three. Most of the patients (84%) had an intellectual disability, 55% had a pervasive developmental disorder and 71% spoke approximately 50 words or less. Prior to the initial assessment, none of the patients were diagnosed with anxiety or mood disorders, while almost one-third of patients received one of these diagnoses in the telepsychiatry clinic. Patients were seen six times on average in the fi{ligature}rst year and three times in the second and third years. The telepsychiatrist recommended a change in the patient's medication for 82% of patients at initial assessment, 41% at year one and 46% at year three. The review suggests that telepsy**chiat**ry evaluations can be valuable for patients with developmental disabilities, providing diagnostic clarity and specifi{ligature}c recommendations that can be implemented by the primary care physician. eid: 2-s2.0-84865826955

22. **A review of the outcomes of the recommendations made during paediatric telepsychiatry consultations**
Little is known about whether the recommendations made during telepsychiatry are actually implemented. We reviewed 100 telepsychiatry consultations, chosen randomly from a paediatric telepsychiatry programme serving **rural** communities in Ontario. Treatment recommendations had been made for each case reviewed and up to nine recommendations had been made for a single case. Twenty-seven percent of recommendations revolved around monitoring (10%), changing (9%), starting (4%), continuing (3%) and stopping (1%) medication. Case managers associated with 54 of the cases were interviewed to determine whether the recommendations had been implemented and to examine the barriers and facilitators to implementation. The results indicated that cooperation of both **child** and parent, clear communication of recommendations, involvement of the school and local health providers, stability of the agencies and availability of services were key components in the successful implementation of recommendations. The matter of technology or technological difficulties acting as a barrier to telepsychiatric consultations was not mentioned by case managers, suggesting that it was not a problem. eid: 2-s2.0-40149096886
23. **Effect of a behavioural health and specialty care telemedicine programme on goal attainment for youths in juvenile detention**
We conducted a pre-post study of the effect of a telepsychiatry counselling service on youths housed in three juvenile detention facilities. In the first year of the telemedicine programme, 321 psychiatry consultations were conducted via telemedicine; in the second year of the programme, 573 psychiatry consultations were conducted. Records for 190 students were then examined by two raters. The total number of behavioural goals for each **adolesc**ent increased from 8.2 in the pre-telemedicine year to 8.7 in the first year of telemedicine and then to 10.0 in the second year (P < 0.05). In Year 2 of the study, subjects also had a significantly higher number of goals in four of the five categories: education, family, health and social skills (P < 0.05). Although other changes at the youth detention facilities or in the juvenile justice system may have been partly responsible for the effects observed, the study suggests that telemedicine may be useful for improving the rate of attainment of goals associated with family relations and personality/behaviour. eid: 2-s2.0-64549154932
24. **Cost savings of telemedicine utilization for child psychiatry in a rural Kansas community**
The costs of pediatric telemedicine services remain underreported and understudied; however, there is evidence that telepediatric services can be cost competitive with traditional ones. For 15 years, the University of Kansas Center for Telemedicine and Telehealth has been providing telemental health outreach from the University of Kansas Medical Center (KUMC). One service site is located in Crawford County, Kansas, which provides telepsychiatry services to **child**ren and **adolesc**ents. The purpose of this study was to examine the costs of operating the Crawford County site relative to accessing services at KUMC, the likely alternative service location. The cost of travel time to parents who accompanied a dependent to either location also was estimated. Patients and parents were examined over a 6-month period in 2006. One hundred thirty-two patients received 257 telemedicine psychiatric consultations during this period. Cost estimates for using the pediatric telemedicine service were assessed for all patients; however, travel and related costs were collected from a sample of 26 patient-parent dyads. The estimated costs of services were obtained using standard cost-accounting procedures. An average cost per consultation in Crawford County was $168.61. The cost savings in travel time and other expenses to parents and patients were substantial between use of the county site and KUMC. Subtracting average savings in travel costs to patients and parents produced an average cost of a telepsychiatry consult in Crawford County of only $30.99. This study was conducted over 6 months with a small number of observations; it should be replicated over a longer study period, with more patients, and with more data that might capture marginal costs of services.

25. **A web-based tutorial for parents of young children with Autism: Results from a pilot study**
Objective: Early intervention can significantly improve long-term outcomes for **child**ren with autism. Unfortunately, m**any c**hildren do not receive early intervention services due to a critical shortage of trained professionals in this area. To bridge this gap, we **evalu**ated a Web-based parent training tutorial (Enhancing Interactions), based on evidence-based practices and utilizing the Web-based platform to maximize learning. Methods: Twenty-three parents** with** a child between 18 months and 6 years with an autism spectrum disorder participated. Pre-and posttest scores of parents' knowledge were used** to e**valuate tutorial effectiveness. The system usability scal**e (SU**S) evaluated technical user-friendliness and the user **satisfact**ion questionnaire (USQ), gau**ged satis**faction with content. Results: The mean number of correct items on the posttest significantly increased, from 12.6 to 20.4, p<0.001. The mean SUS score was 85 (standard deviation=17), corresponding to a score of "excellent." All participants found the tutorial user friendly, well integrated, and 96% (all but one participant) thought it was easy to use, felt confident using the technical features, and would use a tutorial like this again. On the USQ, all participants found that the tutorial was well organized, clearly presented, and easy to understand; that it increased their knowledge about communicating** with** their child; and that they felt capable of applying these techni**ques **with their child. Conclusions: The tutorial appears effective in increasing parents' knowledge with hi**gh user s**atisfaction.  2011, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-82455179552
26. **Telepsychiatry with children and adolescents: Are patients comparable to those evaluated in usual outpatient care?**
Several studies have described successful applications of telepsychiatry with **child**ren and **adolesc**ents. However, there has been little examination of the populations served by telepsychiatry and the ability to **evalu**ate youth accurately through this medium. In this article, we examined whether telepsychiatry patients are representative of those in usual outpatient care. Participants included 369 patients 3-19 years **old e**valuated at two clinics. A new telepsychiatry clinic (TPC) developed to provide services to under-served communities, an**d a c**hild **and ado**lescent psychiatric outpatient clinic (CAPOC) that served youth from predominantly metropolitan areas were included in the study. The telepsychiatry sites were linked using ISDN lines at 384KB/sec. We examined these two samples regarding demographics, payor status, and diagnostic profiles. Results indicated tha**t you**th evaluated through the TPC were broadly comparab**le to** youth evaluated in the CAPOC. Therefore, telepsychiatry appears to serve youth that are representative of those seeking psychiatric care, and it is not restricted to youth with no medical insurance or with selected diagnoses. The similarity of diagnoses further suggests that telepsychiatry provides adequate technical resolution and doctor-patient rapport to detect psychopathology of youths. These findings suggest the need for further systematic investigation of telepsychiatry as a tool for providing psychiatric care to young people. eid: 2-s2.0-4744374907
27. **A child and adolescent psychiatric outreach service for rural New South Wales: A telemedicine pilot study**
Objective: To examine the feasibility of a tertiary outreach service in **child** and **adolesc**ent psychiatry to two **rural** health centres in New South Wales, Australia. Methods: Following a site visit to Dubbo Hospital and Bourke Hospital, telemedical videoconferencing was provided for 2 h/week for 32 weeks. Details of referrers, patients' diagnosis and outcome, and **satisfact**ion with the service were obtained. Results: Cases were triaged by a nominated ru**ral ado**lescent mental health worker. The service provided detailed assessment and management of severe, complex, mental and neuropsychiatric disorders. Fifty-four young people were assessed and 72 joint consultative videoconferencing interviews were undertaken, including 26 initial consultations. Twenty-three initial consultations were undertaken on the visit to **the r**ural centres. Clinical descriptions illustrate the flexibility and sensitivity of the service. Conclusion: Telepsychiatry provides access to a flexible, effective tertiary service for those with special, complex needs, including the disadvantaged or isolated. It makes a valuable, economic contribution to supporting and ed**ucati**ng rural health professionals, thereb**y enr**iching rural **mental health servic**es. eid: 2-s2.0-0032702251
28. **Evaluating satisfaction with a child and adolescent psychological telemedicine outreach service**
A **child** and **adolesc**ent telepsychiatry service in **rural** New South Wales was **evalu**ated. Part of **the e**valuation was to assess whet**her r**ural mental health workers and patients were satisfied with the videoconferencing services provided** by c**hild psychiatrists f**rom t**he Children's Hospital at Westmead. During a 12-month study, information was collected using questionnaires on a total of 136 new patients who had been interviewed via videoconferencing. **Satisfact**ion questionnaires were completed** by 1**00 rural mental health workers, and 82 patients and their families/carers. Questionnaires ab**out satis**faction with the technology were compl**eted **by 136 child psychia**trist**s, 101 rural mental health workers and 79 patients. Patients and their families/car**ers, **as well as rural clinicians, expressed high **overall s**atisfaction with the telepsychiatry servi**ce. T**he evaluation suggested that videoconferencing is a good meth**od of** providing child **and ado**lescent psychiatry ser**vices** to remote and rural communities. eid: 2-s2.0-0043263814
29. **Diffusion of efficacious interventions for children and adolescents with mental health problems**
Background: **Child** and **adolesc**ent mental health problems are prevalent and require adequate interventions. Despite several evidence-based interventions for these problems described in the literature, few studies addressed strategies to diffuse efficacious interventions **for c**hild mental disorders especially in developing countries. Methods: An extensive but not systematic review of the literature was performed aiming to identify evidence-based interventi**ons f**or children **and ado**lescents with mental disorders, professionals to target in disseminating these interventions, and the available strategies to diffuse information. Results: Substantial evidence-based information is available to guide preventive, psychosocial and psychopharmacological interventions. The effectiveness of treatments in real-world settings and the cost-effectiveness of interventions are rarely tested. Professionals at different levels (teachers, school counselors, social workers, general practitioners, ped**iatri**cians, child psychologists and psychiatrists) should be targeted in diffusing efficacious in**terve**ntions for child mental health problems worldwide. Telepsychiatry and the internet seem to be the most promising strategies to diffuse knowledge with lower costs. Conclusions: Medical and allied professiona**ls mu**st incorporate ch**ild and** adolescent mental health issues in their under- and postgraduate curricula, and be better prepared to critically **evalu**ate available information. Professionals need to disseminate evidence-based programs to guide parents and teachers in developing** coun**tries to deal wit**h child** and adolescent difficulties. Countries need to explore internet solutions for dissemination of medical information.  2007 The Authors. eid: 2-s2.0-40449105030
30. **Child and adolescent telepsychiatry: Variations in utilization, referral patterns and practice trends**
Seattle **Child**ren's Hospital is a tertiary referral hospital that has provided telepsychiatry to seven partner sites in the north-west since 2001. Service utilization data, patient demographics and diagnoses were collected for the period from the service inception in October 2001 until November 2007. During the study period, 701 patients were treated with a mean of 2.8 appointments per patient (SD 1.9). Five psychiatrists and four psychologists provided care. Utilization varied across referring sites and was largely dependent upon the availability of telepsychiatrists, although the degree of support from administration and stakeholders also contributed to the success of the service. A total of 190 primary care practitioners referred patients to telepsychiatry, including 106 family physicians and 71 paediatricians. Paediatricians referred to the service more frequently than family physicians (t 1/4 2.8, P, 0.05). Overall, telepsychiatry with young people is feasible, acceptable and increases access to mental health care. There appear to be four core components necessary to a successful telepsychiatry programme: psychiatrists who are interested in exploring new ways to reach underserved young people; clearly identified stakeholders who can collaborate with one another to make good use of the telepsychiatry service**; a c**hildren's mental health 'champion' who represents these stakeholders and wants services for their community; and a stable administration that perceives telepsychiatry as valuable for their patients and their doctors. eid: 2-s2.0-77951001593
31. **Children's experiences with chat support and telephone support**
Background: In line with the wider trend of offering support via the Internet, many counseling and referral services for **child**ren have introduced online chat, often in addition to a traditional telephone service. Methods: A comparative study was conducted between the telephone service and the confidential one-on-one online chat service of the Dutch Kindertelefoon. The design included a concise pretest and a posttest (n = 902). The study also comprised a follow-up test (n = 213), which included the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Resul**ts: C**hildren experienced a higher sense of well-being and a reduced severity of their problems after consulting the Kindertelefoon. The results were slightly more favorable for the chat service than for the telephone service. The follow-up survey showed that many** of t**he children who contact the Kindertelefoon suffer from relatively severe emotional problems. Conclusions: Both the telephone and the web-based support i**mprov**ed the children's well-being and decreased their perceived burden of problem. The results of this study underline the need for closer coop**erati**on between child helplines an**d men**tal health and child welfare services**.  20**09 Association for Child and **Adolesc**ent Mental Health. eid: 2-s2.0-70349564761
32. **Pediatric telepsychiatry in Ontario: Caregiver and service provider perspectives**
Families in **rural** areas face significant geographic and economic obstacles to obtaining pediatric **mental health servic**es. Telepsychiatry promises the possibility of extending specialized expertise into areas that have no resident psychiatrists. In this study, user perspectives and experiences of a pediatric telepsychiatry program serv**ing r**ural communities in Ontario, Canada, were explored. Qualitative, exploratory methods were utilized because of the complex nature** of mental health se**rvices needs and provi**sion **in rural communities. Focus **group**s wit**h rural mental healt**h service providers and interviews with family caregivers of **child**ren receiving a telepsychiatry consultation were conducted. The purpose of this research was to **evalu**ate the benefits and limitations of providing pediatric psychiatric services via video-technology to inform future program development and health policy. Whereas participants in the study indicated that their experiences with the telepsychiatry service had been positive, the need for additional local services to support treatment recommendations was emphasized.  2006 National Council for Community Behavioral Healthcare. eid: 2-s2.0-33744504216
33. **Experience with a rural telepsychiatry clinic for children and adolescents**
Access to **child** and **adolesc**ent psychiatric services in many **rural** areas is limited by lack of physicians and long travel times**. A c**hild **and ado**lescent telepsychiatry clinic that is part of the University of Kansas Medical Center's telemedicine program addresses this problem by linking the medical center with a county mental health center** in r**ural Pittsburg, Kansas. The clinic receives ten to 18 visits a week and has been able to serve severely di**sturb**ed c**hildr**en and children in crisis. The quality of clinical interactions in the telepsychiatry clinic appears comparable to that in face- to-face meetings. eid: 2-s2.0-0032907876
34. **A retrospective analysis of a child and adolescent eMental health program**
OBJECTIVE: New models of psychiatric intervention are needed to improve the accessibility of mental health care in the primary care setting, particularly in **rural** areas of the United States and especially for **child**ren and **adolesc**ents. The aim of this study was to examine the diagnostic characteristics and outcomes **for c**hildren referred for eMental Health consultations at UC Davis (videoconferencing, telephone, and secure e-mail) from 10 primary care clinics** in r**ural northern California. METHOD: A retrospective analysis was conducted on the diagnostic and clinical outcomes of 139 r**eferr**ed children who received a full psychiatric diagnostic **evalu**ation via videoconferencing. Within the group, a convenience sample of 58 initial and 41 three-mont**h fol**low-up Child Behavior Checklists (CBCLs) was collected. RESULTS: Comprehensive eMental Health programs appear to be effective for psychiatric diagnosis an**d ass**essment of children. Attention deficit (36.2%) and mood (28.1%) disorders were the most common diagnostic grou**pings** overall. Most children were seen only once, but a statistically significant improvement between init**ial e**valuation and 3-month follow-up in the convenience sample was seen in the Affect and Oppositional domains of the CBCL for girls and boys, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Versatile eMental Health programs, incorporating standardized checklists, may assist in diagnosis** and **treat**ment **of rural children.

35. **Telepsychiatry with incarcerated youth**
Purpose: Incarcerated **adolesc**ents have a high prevalence of psychiatric disorders but lack psychiatrists to provide ongoing care. Telepsychiatry may provide one solution to treating this underserved population. Methods: Interactive video conferencing was used to connect a minimum security correctional facility with a regional telemedicine program. Clinical records were reviewed to examine utilization, demographics, diagnoses, pharmacotherapy, and patient **satisfact**ion. Results: During the 29-month study period, 115 youth were treated using 275 telepsychiatry visits. Substance-use, behavioral, and emotional disorders were highly prevalent. Eighty percent (80%) of the youth were successfully prescribed medications. Youth expressed confidence with the psychiatrist's recommendations but expressed concerns about privacy. Conclusions: Telepsychiatry can successfully deliver services to incarcera**ted ado**lescents with a wide range of psychiatric needs. A patient-centered approach that directly a**ssesses** adolescen**ts' satis**faction is recommended to ensure youths' optimal involvement in needed services.  2006 **Society** for Adolescent Medicine. eid: 2-s2.0-33646766442
36. **Evolution of telepsychiatry to rural sites: changes over time in types of referral and in primary care providers' knowledge, skills and satisfaction**
Introduction: **Rural** populations remain underserved in terms of psychiatric services. This study assesses changes over time in the utilization of telepsychiatric services by individual primary care providers (PCPs) and clinics** in r**ural areas, specifically: (a) types of referrals for telepsychiatry service; (b) PCPs' knowledge and skills related to medication dosing; and (c) PCPs' **satisfact**ion with telepsychiatry. Methods: Data with regard to patient demographics, diagnoses, reason for consultation, medication dosing **and satis**faction were prospectively collected on the first 200 and the subsequent 200 telepsychiatric initial consultations. A number of educational interventions were implemented during the project. Results: Adult patients were primarily referred for mood and anxiety disorders, particularly for diagnosis and medication treatment planning. Over time, PCPs significantly improved medication dosing and asked for more treatment planning help**. PCPs' s**atisfaction also improved over time. Discussion: Telepsychiatric consultation, in combination with specific educational interventions, appears to facilitate the enhancement of skills and knowledge of PCPs. "Developmental" steps in provider and clinic evolution, along with interventions specific to a given provider's and a given site's needs, ought to be further elucidated.  2006 Elsevier Inc.

37. **Child and adolescent telepsychiatry: Utilization and satisfaction**
Access to psychiatric care for **child**ren and **adolesc**ents is limited outside of urban areas. Telepsychiatry provides one mechanism to bring needed services to youth. This investigation examines whether telepsychiatry could be successful in providing needed services. Using interactive video teleconferencing at 384 kilobits per second, psychiatrists based at a regio**nal c**hildren's hospital provided consultation and management services to patients at 4 sites across Washington State located 75-150 miles f**rom t**he children's hospital. Twelve-month review of billing records provided utilization data. Surveys of parents' **satisfact**ion over 12 months examined whether parents would accept and be satisfied with the care render**ed to** their children. Over the study year, 387 telepsychiatry visits were provided to 172 youth 2-21 years old with a mean of 2.25 visits per patient. The demographic and diagnostic profile of this sample was consistent with usual outpatient mental health samples. Parents endorsed high satisfac**tion **with their children's telepsychiatric care, with an indication of increas**ing satis**faction upon return appointments. Parents demonstrated some diffe**rential s**atisfaction, tendin**g to high**er satisfaction wit**h the**ir school-aged children's** care and** lower satisfaction with th**eir ado**lescents' care. Telepsychiatry off**ered **through a regional children's hospital was well utilized and parents were **highl**y satisfied with their children's care. The stage is now set for integrating telepsychiatry into a system of care that meets youths' overall needs and for controlled studies demonstrating the efficacy of telepsychiatry with youth.

38. **Cost evaluation of a telepsychiatry service in northern Queensland**
We conducted a simple comparison of the costs associated with delivering a **mental health servic**e by telepsychiatry and by conventional methods. The telepsychiatry **rural** outreach service was delivered to a mining town 900 km from the regional hospital in Townsville. When the telemedicine service was well established, 40 cases a month were seen for general adult psychiatry, four for **child** and **adolesc**ent mental health, four for psychology and two for forensic services. Costs and quality-of-life issues were considered. The savings to the health authority were estimated to be $85,380 in the first year and $112,790 in subsequent years, not allowing for maintenance and equipment upgrading. We also estimated a 40% reduction in patient transfers due to the introduction of telemedicine. Based on the previous year's figures of 27 transfers at $8920 each, this would produce an annual saving of $96,336 for the Royal Flying Doctor Service. The results of the study showed considerable savings from reduced travel by patients and health-care workers. eid: 2-s2.0-0031614471
39. **A prospective satisfaction study and cost analysis of a pilot child telepsychiatry service in Newfoundland**
We **evalu**ated user **satisfact**ion with a PC-based videoconferencing system used for **child** psychiatry assessments and performed a cost analysis. Thirty patients (aged 5-16 years), accompanied by a parent, completed a psychiatric assessment using the videoconferencing system. One of f**ive c**hild psychiatrists was randomly assigned to each assessme**nt. Satis**faction questionnaires were completed after each assessment by the psychiatrist, patient and parent. Parents also completed a cost questionnaire. The telecommunications bandwidth was 336 kbit/s. The psychiatrists stated that they were either 'very satisfied' or 'satisfied' with the telepsychiatry assessments. On a five-point Likert scale (1 = lowest, 5 = highest), 28 of the 30 parents (93%) rate**d their s**atisfaction level as 5; the other two rated it 4. All 30 parents (100%) stated that they 'liked' the telepsychiatry assessment and would use the system again. Twenty-nine parents (97%) indicated that they would prefer to use the telepsychiatry system to travelling t**o see** a **child psychiatri**st in per**son. **Eleven children (aged 5-12) participated and all (100%) said they 'liked' using the telepsychiatry system. F**ive o**ut of nine children (56%) stated they liked the 'television doctor' better than the 'real' doctor; four said they had no preference. Nineteen **adolesc**ents (aged 13-16 years) participated and most were very satisfied or satisfied with the system. Seventeen of the** 19 ado**lescents (89%) said they would prefer to see the psychiatrist on the videoconferencing system to travelling for an assessment, and the same number said that they would use telepsychiatry again. The estimated total travel cost for the 30 patients was $12,849, an average of $428 per patient. The total cost of the telepsychiatry service for the three-month pilot was $12,575, or $419 per patient. eid: 2-s2.0-0035235133

This practice parameter discusses the use of telepsychiatry to provide services to **child**ren and **adolesc**ents. The parameter defines terms and reviews the status of telepsychiatry as a mode of health service delivery. Because many of the issues addressed are unique to telepsychiatry, the parameter presents principles for establishing a telepsychiatry service and optimizing clinical practice within that service. The principles presented are based on existing scientific evidence and clinical consensus. Telepsychiatry is still evolving, and this parameter represents a first approach to determining "best practices."

41. **A randomized, controlled trial of child psychiatric assessments conducted using videoconferencing**
We used a PC-based videoconferencing system to conduct **child** psychiatry assessments. The telecommunications link was six digital lines, giving a total bandwidth of 336 kbit/s. Twenty-three patients (aged 4-16 years), accompanied by their parents, completed two psychiatric assessments, one via videoconferencing and another face to face (FTF). The order of assessments was randomized. Questionnaires were used to record the diagnosis, treatment recommendations and the psychiatrists', patients' and their parents' **satisfact**ion with each assessment. An independent **evalu**ator concluded that in 22 cases (96%) the diagnosis and treatment recommendations made via the videoconferencing system were the same as those made FTF. The psychiatrists stated that videoconferencing assessments were an adequate alternative to FTF assessments and did not interfere with diagnosis. However, the responses from the psychiatr**ist satis**faction questionnaire showed that they preferred FTF assessments. No significant difference was found in the patients' or p**arents' s**atisfaction responses after the two types of assessment. The majority** of c**hildren (82%) 'liked' using the telepsychiatry system and six (26%) preferred it to a FTF assessment. Most parents (91%) indicated that they would prefer to use the videoconferencing system than to travel a long distance to see a psychiatrist in person. eid: 2-s2.0-19244381817
42. **Lessons learned in a physician referral to pediatric telemental health services program**
Background: This study explores the physician referral and engagement process of a pediatric telemental health program based in a large urban teaching **child**rens hospital, and identifies the processes, strengths and challenges from the perspectives of Primary Care Physicians (PCPs) and telepsychiatrist consultants. Methods: A mixed methods approach was used. This included an online survey completed by 43 PCPs in Ontario **rural** communities who had referred patients to the telemental health program. Qualitative interviews were conducted with** 11 c**hild/**adolesc**ent telepsychiatrists who provide consultations via teleconferencing. Results: The majority of PCPs (61%) reported somewhat to moderate **satisfact**ion with referral experiences. Challenges identified by physicians were related to communication and administration issues including: lack of timely follow-up appointments and continuity of care; lengthy referral forms; and recommendations for **mental health servic**es not accessible in their communities. Similarly, psychiatrist consultants expressed frustration with the sparse information they received from referring physicians and most significantly, the absence of appropriate service providers/professionals during the consultation to provide collateral information and ensure uptake of recommendations. Conclusion: Telemental health programs provide a valuable service to PCPs an**d the**ir child and youth clients that could be significantly enhanced with a different consultation model. Such models of service delivery require protocols to educate PCPs, improve communication and information sharing and establish clear expectations between PCPs and telepsychiatry consultants.  2019, Canadian** Acad**emy of Child **and Ado**lescent Psychiatry.

43. **Telemedicine and autism spectrum disorder in children and adolescents: Theoretical and practical guide [Tlmdecine et troubles du spectre de l'autisme de l'enfant et de l'adolescent: guide thorique et pratique]**
Objectives: The development of telemedicine for **child**ren and **adolesc**ents is a real need because of difficult accessibility of mental health and the paucity** of c**hildhood psychiatrists. Thus the American Acad**emy f**or Child **and Ado**lescent Psychiatry (AACAP) published in 2008 good practice recommendations for teleps**ychia**try in child**ren and** adolescents based on clinical consensus and scientific evidence. In France the legal framework defines four practical modalities according to the presence or not of a health professional or a psychologist with the practitioner accomplishing the **teleconsult**ation act. Data exist about** the **outcome of c**hildren** and adolescents who benefited from therapeutic interventions with technological media. Effect size is modest but it doesn't justify ruling ou**t the**se techniques. Children who present with a developmental disorder or who cannot cooperate are **evalu**ated with a certain degree of uncerta**inty.** By contrast, some children with severe Attention Deficit with or without Hyperactivity (ADHD), social anxiety or Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) can be more easily engaged withi**n a telecon**sultation** model. Tel**econsultations in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are feasible because of the nature of diagnosis and the type of care recommended in this disorder. The behavioral nature of the disorder and the behavioral therapeutic approaches recommended in North America culture highlight the potential interest of telemedicine because these disorders are easily observable. Literature suggests new opportunities in order to facilitate the care process for the ASD person and his family: the first one is diagnosis with use of validated instruments such as the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) and the Autism Diagnostic Interview (ADI). Parental accompaniment is the second opportunity. Development of telemedicine for ASD could be a complementary approach for diagnosis and medical care. Method: Since 2015, a program called PROMETTED (PROgramme MEdical de Tlpsychiatrie **pour en**fants et adolescents prsentant un Trouble Envahissant du Dveloppement) was supported by Regional Health Agency of le-de-France. It was developed and managed by the team of a Diagnosis Cen**ter E**valuation for Autism (DCEA) of Paris area in collaboration with a DCEA of le-de-France region. Five m**edico**-social structur**es for **children and adolescents with autistic disorders and the two diagnosis cen**ters **of evaluation for autism co-elaborated a scheme of intervention with telemedicine.** The **remote evaluation is a 4-step proce**ss: a first** teleconsultation structured around the medical history of the subject in order to complete his medical file and the observation of the young su**bject; a se**cond teleconsultation structured around the ADI-R interview with** parents; t**he third tele**consultatio**n is a mixed teleconsultation associating the medical expert of the DCEA and a psychol**ogist** trained in the use of the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) and the Vineland Adaptive Behavio**r Scales (V**ABS). The fourth teleconsultation consists of the psychiatrist giving feed-back to parents about the results of the observations of the DCEA team. Results: The four-step program is well-accepted and the use of validated instruments for diagnosi**s or **functional evaluation appears feasible. Medical data were completed for 44% of cases; complementary genetic or medical investigations were prescribed for 50% of cases; medical advice about psychotropic or vitaminic medication was given for 31% of case**s. Me**an duration of evaluation was 11.1 weeks  9.4. Conclusions: The PROMETTED program empirically validates t**he co**ncept of remote eval**uation **for children and adolescents with ASD.

44. **Clinician perspectives delivering telehealth interventions to children/families impacted by pediatric traumatic brain injury**
Purpose: Technological advances have made the delivery of psychological interventions via web-based platforms increasingly feasible. In recent years, there has been growth in the delivery of psychological interventions through web-based modalities, that is, telepsychology. Although there is evidence supporting the usability and feasibility of telepsychology for a range of populations, there is limited literature on clinician perceptions delivering telepsychology, particularly to pediatric rehabilitation populations. In this mixedmethods study, we report on clinician perspectives and experiences delivering telepsychology to **child**ren/ families impacted by pediatric traumatic brain injury. Method: Seventeen clinicians (psychologists and advanced psychology doctoral students) who delivered telepsychology interventions** to c**hildren/families impacted by pediatric brain injuries completed surveys and interviews. Results: Overall, clinicians reported that telepsychology was equivalent to face-to-face treatment in many regards (e.g., therapeutic alliance, weekly pr**ogres**s, child/family engagement, and establishing rapport). Clinicians reported a number of advantages of telepsychology over face-to-face interventions for this pediatric population including greater ease of scheduling, increased understanding of the family and home environments, and less caregiver stigma of behavioral health care. Disadvantages of telepsychology included difficulties reading nonverbal cues, logistical/technological issues, and greater disruptions during sessions. Conclusions: Findings provide an important foundation for future investigations examining the merits of telepsychology versus traditional treatment for both pediatric rehabilitation populations.  2019 American Psychological Association. eid: 2-s2.0-85062274795

Introduction Telepsychiatry is defined as the use of information and communication technology (ICT) in providing remote psychiatric services. Telepsychiatry is applied using two types of communication: **synchron**ous (real time) and** **async**hron**ous (store and forward). Objective To determine the **cost**-effectivene**ss of a **synchronous and** an async**hronous telepsychiatric model in prison inmate patients with symptoms of depression. Method**s A **cost-effectiveness study was performed on a population consisting of 157patients from the Establecimiento Penitenciario y Carcelario de Mediana Seguridad de Manizales, Colombia. The sample was determined by applying Zung self-administered surveys for depression (1965) and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), the latter being the tool used for the comparison. Results Initial Hamilton score, arrival time, duration of system downtime, and clinical effectiveness variables had normal distributions (P>.05). There were significant differences (P<.001) betwe**en c**are costs for the different models, showing th**at t**he mean cost**** of the** a**synchronous mod**el is le**ss than synchronous model, and** making t**he asynchro**nous** model more cost-effective. ****Conclus**io**ns The asynchronou**s mo**del is the most cost-effective model of telepsychiatry care for patients with depression admitted to a detention centre, according to the results of **clin**ical effectiveness, cost measurement, and patient satisfaction.  2016 Asociacin Colombiana de Psiquiatra eid: 2-s2.0-84973590686
1. **Cost-effectiveness of a novel e-health depression service**
Objectives: A recent trial assessed feasibility of an e-health service ("Improvehealth.eu") to support depression care and reported positive outcomes. Our objective was to examine **cost**-effectiveness of the Improvehealth.eu service. A baseline model was used to evalu**ate **cost and effects of the intervention. Given the high uncertainty in the input space, a series of alternative scenarios were evaluated to challenge the result. The aim was to find if conservative or even pessimistic estimates and assumptions could result in a change** of **the cost-effectiveness from the baseline model. Materials and Methods: A probabilistic depression model combined with bootstrapping was built and populated with data from the literature and from the pilot efficacy trial of the e-health service. The core of the model was a stochastic mapping function that translated depression-specific outcomes to quality-adjusted life years. Correlated sampling was used to obtain unbiased and consistent piecewise linear transformation of Beck Depression Inventory scores to utilities. The results a**re s**hown as cost-effectiveness acceptability curves with value of information data. An extreme scenario **analysi**s was then performed to deal with parameter, structural, and modeling uncert**aint**y. Results: Cost-effectiveness of the e-health service was favor**able** because of low cost and high efficacy of the intervention. Apart from the most pessimistic one, none of the 13 alternative scenarios changed the preferred alternative. Conclusio**ns: **Improvehealth.eu is cost-effective relative to usual care, given the available efficacy data. Results of the health economic evaluation were robust to alternative assumptions, despite considerable uncertainty in input data.  Copyright 2013, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2013. eid: 2-s2.0-84891643082
2. **Asynchronous Telepsychiatry: A Component of Stepped Integrated Care**
Objective: Integrated behavioral healthcare models typically involve a range of consultation options for mental healthcare. **A**synchron****ous telepsychiatry (ATP) consults may be an additional potential choice, so we are conducting a 5-year clinical trial comparing ATP w**ith sync**hronous telepsychiatry (STP) consultations. Methods: Patients referred by primary care providers are randomly assigned to one of the two treatment groups, ATP or STP. Clinical outcome, satisfaction, and economic data are being collected from patients for 2 years at 6-month intervals. Results: Baseline characteristics for the **first** 158 patients and case examples of ATP are presented. Conclusion: Implementing ATP in existing integrated behavioral healthcare models could make mental healthcare more efficient.  Copyright 2018, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-85046971165
3. **Asynchronous telepsychiatry in Maharashtra, India: Study of feasibility and referral pattern**
Context: There is a paucity of published telepsychiatry results in India. Aims: This study was conducted to assess the feasibility of **a**synchron****ous telepsychiatry and to study the referral patterns. Settings and Design: This study was conducted in the telemedicine unit of a tertiary care center and design was retrospective **analysi**s of 94 cases, which were diagnosed and treated by telepsychiatry. Materials and Methods: All 94 patients who were referred between January 2007 and August 2013 for telepsychiatry consultations were retrospectively analyzed to assess the referral pattern and feasibility. Statisti**cal Ana**lysis Used: Comparisons between demographic parameters and psychiatric diagnosis was done using Chi-square test. Results: In 89 out of 94 (95%) patients it was possible to make a definitive diagnosis and recommend appropriate treatment only on the basis of data received from the primary care physician by telepsychiatry. This indicates the feasibility of telepsychiatry. The most common problems for which referrals were made included schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, mood disorders and substance related disorders. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the feasibility** of Async**hronous telepsychiatry. Additional Indian studies should be conducted to build the evidence base for the best** use of** a**sync**hronous telepsychiatry. eid: 2-s2.0-84903980960

Results: Psychiatric Video Archiving and Communication System has been used to conduct the **first** ever series** of async**hronous telepsychiatry consultations worldwide. A review of the software application and the process as part of this project has led to a number of improvements that are being implemented in the next version, which is being written in Java. Conclusions: This is **the f**irst description of the use of video recorded dat**a in an** a**sync**hronous telemedicine application. Primary care providers and consulting psychiatrists have found it easy to work with and a valuable resource to increase the availability of psychiatric consultation in remote rural locations.  2011, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-79957603064
5. **Cost analysis of store-and-forward telepsychiatry as a consultation model for primary care**
Store-and-forward telepsychiatry, or **a**synchron****ous telepsychiatry (ATP), which allows clinical data, including video to be collected to be reviewed at a later time by a specialist, has been described as a feasible alternative to real-time telepsychiatry,** or sync**hronous telepsychiatry (STP), as a consultation model for primary care. In theory, ATP should be economically more **cost**-effective than STP due to the increased flexibility of patient data collection and the substitution of the time of specialists with that of lo**wer-**cost providers. The aim of this study was to conduct a retros**pect**ive cost-**analysi**s comparing ATP with STP and traditional in-person psychiatric consultations in the primary care setting. One hundred and twenty five ATP consultations were performed and fixed a**nd m**arginal costs were calculated for each model using inputs su**ch a**s equipment costs, time spent by providers and support staff, and hourly **sala**ries. The fixed costs were $7,000 and $20,000 for A**TP a**nd STP and marginal costs were $68.18, $107.50, and $96.36, respectively, for the three groups. STP was the most expensive of the three types of consult**atio**ns. ATP became the most cost-effective of the three models beyond **249 **consultations. The marginal cost savings of **ATP **were due to substitution of low-cost providers for specialists. ATP represents a potential disruptive healthcare process that could allow more affordable care to be delivered to a larger population of patients. A full accounting of ATP's efficiency will require** fur**ther studies, including prospective cost-benefit analyses from the perspectives of the patient, provider, and society.  2012 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-84856731575
6. **A feasibility study of the use of asynchronous telepsychiatry for psychiatric consultations**
Objective: This study examined the feasibility of conducting psychiatric consultations using **a**synchron****ous, or store-and-forward, videobased telepsychiatry. Methods: Video-recorded 20- to 30-minute assessments of 60 nonemergency, English-speaking adult patients in a medically underserved county in California were uploaded along with other patient data to a Webbased record. Two psychiatrists then used the record to provide psychiatric consultations to the referring primary care providers. Results: Eighty-five percent of patients received diagnoses of mood disorders, 32% diagnoses of substance use disorders, 53% diagnoses of anxiety disorders, and 5% other axis I diagnoses. Psychiatrists recommended short-term medication changes for 95% of the patients and provided guidelines for possible future changes. Conclusions: This study - the **first** study** of async**hronous telepsychiatry to be published - demonstrated the feasibility of this approach. This type of assessment should not replace the face-to-face psychiatric interview, but it may be a very helpful additional process that improves access to care and expertise. eid: 2-s2.0-77955366460

0. **Predicting post treatment client satisfaction between behavioural activation for depression delivered either in-person or via home-based telehealth**
Introduction: Treatment engagement, adherence, cancellations and other patient-centric data are important predictors of **treatment **outcom****e. But often these data are only examined retrospectively. In this investigation, we analysed data from a clinical trial focused on innovative delivery of **depress**ion treatment to identify which patients are likely to prefer either in-home or in-person treatment based on pre-treatment characteristics. Methods: Patient satisfaction was assessed in a trial of individuals w**ith dep**ression treated using identical behavioural activation therapy protocols in person or through videoconferencing to the home (N = 87 at post treatment: 42 in-person and 45 in-home participants). The Client Satisfaction Questionnaire was administered at the end of the treatment. A Tobit regression model was used to assess moderation using treatment assignment. Regression lines were generated to model treatment satisfaction as a function of treatment assignment and to identify whether and where the groups intersected. We examined the distributions of the contributing moderators to the subsets of participants above and below the intersection point to identify differences. Results: While no significant differences in patient satisfaction were observed between the two groups, or between patients receiving treatment by different providers, baseline characteristics of the sample could be used to differentiate those with a preference for traditional, in-office care from those preferring in-home care. Discussion: Participants who were more likely to prefer in-home care were characterized by larger proportions of veterans and lower-ranked enlisted service members. They also had more severe symptoms at baseline and less formal education. Understanding client reactions when selecting treatment modality may allow for a more satisfying patient experience.

1. **Enthusiasm for homework and improvement of psychological distress in subthreshold depression during behavior therapy: Secondary analysis of data from a randomized controlled trial**
Background: **Cognit**ive behavioral therapy (CBT) usually involves homework, the completion of which is a known predictor of a positive **outcom**e. The aim of the present study was to examine the session-by-session relationships between enthusiasm to complete the homework and the improvement of psychological distress in **depress**ed people through the course of therapy. Methods: Working people with subthresh**old dep**ression were recruited to participate in the telephone CBT (tCBT) program with demonstrated effectiveness. Their enthusiasm for homework was enhanced with motivational interviewing techniques and was measured by asking two questions: "How strongly do you feel you want to do this homework?" and "How confident do you feel you can actually accomplish this homework?" at the end of each session. **The ou**tcome was the K6 score, which was administered at the start of each session. The K6 is an index of psychological distress in**cluding** depression and anxiety. We used structural equation modeling (SEM) to elucidate the relationships between enthusiasm and the K6 scores from session to session. Results: The best fitting model suggested that, throughout the course of behavior therapy (BT), enthusiasm to complete the homework was negatively correlated with the K6 scores for the subsequent session, while the K6 score measured at the beginning of the session did not influence the enthusiasm to complete the homeworks assigned for that session. Conclusions: Empirical data now support the practitioners of BT when they try to enhance their patient's enthusiasm for homework regardless of the participant's distress, which then would lead to a reduction in distress in the subsequent week.  2015 Hayasaka et al. eid: 2-s2.0-84947976375
2. **Exploring the relationship between the acceptability of an internet-based intervention for depression in primary care and clinical outcomes: Secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial**
Background: **Depress**ion is one of the most prevalent psychological disorders worldwide. Although psychotherapy **for dep**ression is effective, there are barriers to its implementation in primary care in Spain. The use of the Internet has been shown to be a feasible solution. However, the acceptability of Internet-based interventions has not been studied sufficiently. Objective: To assess the acceptability of an Internet-based intervention (I**BI) for** depression in primary care, and explore the relationship between expectations and satisfaction and the improvement in the clinical variables in primary care patients receiving this intervention. Furthermore, it offers data about the effects of some sociodemographic characteristics on these acceptability variables and analyzes whether the expectations are related to finalizing the intervention. Methods: Data we**re base**d on depressive patients who were participants in a randomized **control**led trial. In the present study, we present the data from all the participants in the Internet intervention groups (N = 198). All the participants filled out the expectation and satisfaction scales (six-item scales regarding treatment logic, satisfaction, recommending, usefulness for other disorders, usefulness for the patient, and unpleasant**ness), **the Beck Depression Inventory-II, and the secondar**y outco**me measures: depression and anxiety impairment, and positive and negative affect. Results: Results showed that participants' expectations and satisfaction with the program were both high and differences in expectations and satisfaction depended on some sociodemographic variables (age: older people have higher expectations; sex: women have greater satisfaction). A positive relationship between these variables and intervention efficacy was found: expectations related to usefulness for the patient were a statistically related predictor to the results on the BDI-II (Beta = 0.364), and the perception of how logical the treatment is (Beta = 0.528) was associated with change in the clinical variable. Furthermore, the higher the expectations, the higher the improvements exhibited by the patients in all measures evaluated during the ten intervention modules. High expectations were also directly related to finalizing the intervention. Conclusions: This is the first study in Spain to address this issue i**n the f**ield of IBIs for depression in primary care. The IBI showed high acceptance related to the intervention's efficacy and completion. Research on IBI acceptability could help to implement the treatment offered.

3. **Telephone-based cognitive behavioural therapy for female patients 1-year post-bariatric surgery: A pilot study**
Objective: Although bariatric surgery is a durable treatment for patients with severe obesity, it does not directly address behavioural and psychological factors that potentially contribute to weight regain post-surgery. Psychological interventions, such as **cognit**ive behavioural therapy (CBT), can be challenging to access due to physical limitations and practical barriers. Telephone-based CBT (Tele-CBT) can improve eating psychopathology and psychological distress before and after surgery. Given the frequent occurrence/recurrence of problematic eating-related and psychological issues many patients face 1-year post-surgery, this open-trial pilot study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of Tele-CBT delivered 1-year post-surgery as an adjunctive treatment to the usual standard of bariatric care. Methods: Patients (n = 43) received six 1-h Tele-CBT sessions delivered weekly beginning at 1-year post-surgery. Patients completed questionnaire packages before and after the intervention to assess changes in binge eating (BES), emotional eating (EES), **depress**ion (PHQ-9), and anxiety (GAD-7). Results: Thirty-two patients completed Tele-CBT yielding a 74.4% completion rate. Participants reported significant improvements on the Binge Eating Scale (t(31) = 3.794, p = 0.001), Emotional Eating Scale (t(31) = 3.508, p = 0.001), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 Item Scale (z = 2.371, p = 0.018), and Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 Item Scale (z = 3.546, p < 0.001) immediately following Tele-CBT. Discussion: The results demonstrate that Tele-CBT delivered 1-year post-surgery may improve binge eating, emotional eati**ng, dep**ression, and anxiety. Additional research is warranted to examine whether these changes translate into long-term improvements in bariatric surgery **outcom**es.  2019 Asia Oceania Association for the Study of Obesity eid: 2-s2.0-85070292051
4. **A Two-Tiered Strategy for Preventing Complications of Bereavement in the First Thirteen Months Post-Loss: A Pilot Study Using Peer Supports with Professional Therapist Back-up**
This feasibility and acceptance pilot study for preventing complications of bereavement within the first year post loss recruited 20 adult grievers within 9 months of becoming bereft and assigned consenting subjects to peer supporters trained by a non-profit bereavement support organization for weekly or bi-weekly telephone-based peer support until month 13 post-loss. Subjects who met DSM-5 criteria for major **depress**ive disorder or showed an Inventory of Complicated Grief (ICG) score exceeding 19, 6 months or more post loss, were assigned to 12 to 16 weeks of interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) with an experienced therapist. Eight and six subjects completed the protocol assigned to peer support and IPT, respectively, with pre/post Patient Health Questionnaire-9 scores of 5.38 (2.45) versus 3.25 (4.13) (p = 0.266) and 16.67 (7.17) versus 8.40 (5.73) (p =0.063); and pre/post ICG scores of 12.50 (4.72) versus 5.00 (2.51) (p = 0.016) and 35.17 (5.12) versus 8.4 (5.73) (p = 0.063). Implications of this two-tiered model of early intervention for preventing complications of grief are discussed.  2017 American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry eid: 2-s2.0-85030571254
5. **Pregnancy and the Acceptability of Computer-Based Versus Traditional Mental Health Treatments**
Background: Recent recommendations urge increased **depress**ion screening in pregnant and postpartum women, potentially increasing demand for treatment. Computer-based psychotherapy treatments may address some of perinatal women's unique mental health treatment needs and barriers. Materials and Methods: We conducted a quantitative survey of pregnant women (12 weeks of gestation) on preferences regarding computer-based therapies compared with traditional therapies (psychotherapy and medication). Nonpregnant women and men served as comparison groups. Participants were provided descriptions of three computer-based therapies: Video telehealth therapy (VTT), computer-assisted therapy (CAT), and self-guided online therapy (SGO). Participants were asked to select all options that they would consider for treatment as well as first choice preference. The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) assessed curr**ent dep**ressive symptomatology, and the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) assessed psychiatric history. Results: Participants included pregnant females (n = 111), nonpregnant females (n = 147), and males (n = 54). Among pregnant women, 77.5% (n = 86) indicated that they would consider some form of computer-based therapy for mental health treatment during pregnancy; VTT was the most commonly considered, followed by CAT and SGO. When asked to select their preferred intervention, traditional talk therapy was the first choice among all three groups, **control**ling for treatment history and PHQ-9 score. About one-third of pregnant women chose some form of computer-based therapy as their top choice. Conclusions: While computer-based therapies were acceptable to most pregnant women in this sample, traditional talk therapy was the preferred option. Future research should consider how to tailor computer-based therapies to the unique needs of perinatal women.  2017, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-85031664085
6. **A positive psychology intervention for patients with bipolar depression: a randomized pilot trial**
Background: There are few effective treatments for bipolar **depress**ion, a common and debilitating illness. Aims: We aimed to examine the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a four-week, telephone-delivered positive psychology (PP) intervention for patients with bipo**lar dep**ression. Methods: Twenty-five patients hospitalized for **bipolar** depression were randomized to receive a PP (n = 14) or **control** condition (CC; n = 11) intervention. Following discharge, participants completed weekly exercises and phone calls with a study trainer. PP intervention feasibility was assessed by the number of exercises completed, and acceptability was examined on five-point Likert-type scales of ease and utility. Between-group differences on psychological constructs at 4 and 8weeks post-enrollment were assessed using mixed effects regression models. Results: Participants in the PP group completed an average of three out of four PP exercises and found PP exercises to be subjectively helpful, though neither easy nor difficult. Compared to CC, the PP intervention led to trends towards greater improvements in positive affect and optimism at follow-up, with large effect sizes (modified Cohens d = 0.951.24). PP had variable, non-significant effects on negative psychological constructs. Conclusions: Larger, randomized trials are needed to further evaluate the efficacy of this intervention in this high-risk population.  2018,  2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group. eid: 2-s2.0-85048582203
7. **The effects of psychoeducation and telepsychiatric follow-up on social functioning and medication adherence in the patients with schizophrenia [izofreni hastalari{dotless}na verilen ruhsal eitim ve telepsikiyatrik izlemenin hasta ilevsellii ve ila uyumuna etkisi]**
Objective: This randomized-**control**led experimental study was conducted to determine the effects of psychoeducation in the clinic and regular telepsychiatric follow-up (via telephone) after discharge on social functioning, drug adherence of patients with schziophrenia. Methods: This study was performed on totally 62 patients, assigned to experiment (n=32) **and con**trol (n=30) groups, from 1st July 2010 to 31st May 2011, being followed in Mental Health Center of Kayseri Training and Research Hospital and meeting research criteria. Patients' characteristics were recorded by a form. For the patients in experim**ent and** control groups; before education, after education and after 6-months telephone follow-up Scales of Medication Adherence Rating, Social Functioning were applied. In the psychoeducation process, the patients in the experiment group were given 'Manual of Information for Patients with Schziophrenia' prepared by the researcher. After discharge, patients were interviewed by telephone for 6 months, every week regularly in average for 15 minutes. A standard, semi-structured interview form consisting of 7 questions were used for telephone follow-up. Results: For the patients in the experiment group, after physchoeducation and telephone follow-up, the mean scores for adherence to treatment and social functioning scores were increased, the differences between before and after education and after telephone follow-up were significant. Again, the differences between the mean scores of adherence to treatment and social functioning were significant after education and after telephone follow-up for the patients in both exp**eriment** and control groups. In addition, the group and time interaction of the mean scores for adherence to treatment and social functioning were significant. Conclusion: According to these results, the psychoeducation and telepsychiatric follow-up via telephone induced increases in adherence to treatment and social functioning for the patients. Supporting the patients with schizophrenia via psychoeducation and telepsychiatric follow-up had positive impact on these patients and these techniques are recommended to be used in patient follow-up at home. eid: 2-s2.0-84885139707
8. **Common Factors and Depressive Symptom Relief Trajectories in Group Teletherapy for Persons Ageing with HIV**
Telepsychology research has focused primarily on treatment efficacy, with far less attention devoted to how common factors relate to teletherapy **outcom**es. This research identified trajectories of **depress**ive symptom relief in 105 older people living with HIV with eleva**ted dep**ressive symptoms enrolled in a randomized clinical trial testing two 12-session group teletherapies and compared common factors (e.g., therapeutic alliance and group cohesion)** across** depressive symptom trajectory groups. Growth mixture modellin**g of we**ekly depression scores i**dentifi**ed three depressive symptom change groups: (1) early improvers (31%) who rep**orted r**eductions in depressive symptoms by Session 4; (2) delayed improvers (16%) whose symptoms improved after Session 5 and (3) non-improvers (53%). Therapeutic alliance was unrelated to **treatm**ent ou**tcom**e group. Group cohesion was greater in early improvers than non-improvers. Group cohesion was unexpectedly lower, and group member similarity was greater in delayed improvers than non-improvers. Early improvers had been living with HIV/AIDS for fewer years than non-improvers. In group teletherapy, group cohesion and group member similarity are more important than clienttherapist alliance. Copyright  2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Key Practitioner Message: In group teletherapy with older people living with HIV (OPLWHIV), three** laten**t outcome trajectory groups emerged over the 12-week treatment period: (1) non-improvers (53%); (2) early improvers (31%) and (3) delayed improvers (16%). In group teletherapy with OPLWHIV, group cohesion is **a stron**ger predictor of depressive symptom relief than is clienttherapist alliance. OPLWHIV in group teletherapy who do not respond to treatment until the latter therapy se**ssions **can still experience depressive symptom relief comparable with early responders.

9. **Effect of psychotherapy for depression via home telehealth on glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes: Subgroup analysis of a randomized clinical trial**
Objective: We evaluated the impact of telemedicine-delivered behaviour activation treatment (BAT) on glycemic **control** in a subgroup of older adults with diabetes who participated in a randomi**zed con**trolled trial for **depress**ion. Research design and methods: We randomized older adults with ma**jor dep**ression to same-room or telemedicine BAT. Each group received eight weekly sessions. For the subgroup analysis, we identified individuals with type 2 diabetes and obtained hemoglobin A1c at baseline and 12 months follow-up. We used mixed-effects models (MEM) for repeated measures analysis to compare the longitudinal mean A1c. We estimated model-derived mean A1c values and considered an adjusted model to account for baseline health status. Results: We included 90 individuals with type 2 diabetes of the original 241 in the subgroup analysis (43 in telemedicine and 47 in same room). Treatment groups were not significantly different at baseline for demogr**aphics,** depression, anxiety or A1c levels (telemedicine 6.9 vs. same room 7.3, p = 0.19). Baseline mean A1c for the telemedicine group remained at 6.9 (55 mmol/mol) at 12 months, whereas baseline mean A1c for the same-room group increased to 7.7 (61 mmol/mol). Longitudinal trajectories of model-derived mean A1c indicated a significant main effect of treatment group on mean A1c value at study end (difference = 0.82, 95% CI 1.41, 0.24). Adjusted analyses gave comparable results. Conclusions: Telemedicine-delivered BAT was superior to same room in achieving lower mean A1c values in participants with type 2 diabetes, suggesting BAT-delivered via telemedicine is a viable treatment option for adults with diabetes.

10. **Predictors of persistence of comorbid generalized anxiety disorder among veterans with major depressive disorder**
Objective: A limited number of randomized clinical trials show that **efficaci**ous pharmacologic treatments exist for comorbid major **depress**ive disorder (MDD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). The aims of this effectiveness study were to describe the impact o**f a dep**ression care management intervention on the persistence of comorbid GAD symptoms in a sample of primary care patients with MDD and to identify risk factors for persistent GAD. Method: Data were collected from April 2003 to September 2005 for the Telemedicine-Enhan**ced Ant**idepressant Management (TEAM) study, a multisite, randomized effectiveness trial targeting US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) primary care pa**tients **with depression. Veterans aged 26.59-88.36 years received either the TEAM intervention or usual care in small VA community-based outpatient clinics. The TEAM care management intervention focused on** optimi**zing antidepressant therapy through patient education and activation, symptom monitoring, adherence promotion, and side-effect management. Veterans who screened positive for MDD using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (based on DSM-IV criteria) and who met the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview criteria (maintaining consistency with DSM-IV-TR) for comorbid GAD at baseline were selected for the present study (N = 168). The primary **outcom**e was persistence of GAD at 6 months and 12 months. All predictors available in the TEAM study data that were described in the literature to be associated with influencing **GAD ou**tcomes were examined. Resu**lts: Pe**rsistence of depression was the strongest predictor of persistence of comorbid GAD at both 6 months (OR = 5.75; 95% CI, 2.38-13.86; P < .05) and 12 months (OR = 15.56; 95% CI, 6.10-39.68; P < .05). Although the TEAM interventio**n signi**ficantly reduced depression symptom severity, it was not significantly associated with GAD persistence. Insomnia was a significant protective factor for persistence of GAD at 6 months (OR = 0.66; 95% CI, 0.44-0.99; P < .05). Conclusions: Early screening for presence of comorbid GAD among those with MDD may be valuable both for further research and for enhancing clinical management of GAD and MDD comorbidity.

11. **Counselling versus low-intensity cognitive behavioural therapy for persistent sub-threshold and mild depression (CLICD): A pilot/feasibility randomised controlled trial**
Background: Persistent **depress**ive symptoms below the threshold criteria for ma**jor dep**ression represent a chronic condition with high risk of progression to a diagnosis o**f major** depression. The evidence base for psychological treatments such as Person-Centred Counselling and Low-Intensity **Cognit**ive Behavioural Therapy for su**b-thres**hold depressive sy**mptoms **and mild depression is limited, particularly for longer-term **outcom**es. Methods: This study aimed to test the feasibility of delivering a randomised **control**led trial into the clinical and cost effectiveness of Low-Intens**ity Co**gnitive Behavioural Therapy versus Person-Centred Counselling for patients with persi**stent s**ub-threshold depre**ssive s**ymptoms and mild depression. The prim**ary ou**tcome measures for this pilot/feasibility trial were recruitment, adherence and retention rates at six months from baseline. An important se**condar**y outcome measure was recov**ery fro**m, or prevention of, depression at six months assessed via a structured clinical interview by an independent assessor blind to the participant's treatment condition. Thirty-six patients were recruited in five general practices and were randomised to either eight weekly sessions of person-centred counselling each lasting up to an hour, or up to eight w**eeks o**f cognitive-behavioural self-help resources with guided telephone support sessions lasting 20-30 minutes each. Results: Recruitment rate in relation to the number of patients approached at the general practices was 1.8 %. Patients attended an average of 5.5 sessions in both interventions. Retention rate for the 6-month follow-up assessments was 72.2 %. Of participants assessed at six months, 71.4 % of partic**ipants **with a diagnosis of mild depression at baseline had recovered, while 66.7 % with a d**iagnosi**s of persistent subthreshold depress**ion at **baseline had not developed major depression. There were no significant differences between treatment** groups** for both recovery and prevention of depression at six months or on** any o**f the outcome measures. Conclusions: It is feasible to recruit participants and successfully deliver both interventions in a primary care** settin**g to patients with subthreshold and mild depression; however recruiting requires significant input at the general practices. The evidence from this study suggests that short-term Person-Centred Counselling and Lo**w-Inte**nsity Cognitive Behaviour Therapy are potentially effective and their effectiveness should be evaluated in a larger randomi**sed con**trolled study which includes a health economic evaluation.

12. **Occupational impact of internet-delivered cognitive behaviour therapy for depression and anxiety: Reanalysis of data from five Australian randomised controlled trials**
Objective: To determine whether internet-delivered **cognit**ive behaviour therapy (iCBT) for **depress**ion and anxiety reduces self-reported absenteeism in employed individuals.Design, participants and setting: We reanalysed data from five randomised **control**led trials of iCBT: two **for dep**ression (conducted from September 2008 to February 2009 and from June 2009 to January 2010), two for generalised anxiety disorder (conducted from March 2009 to June 2009 and from July 2009 to January 2010) and one for social phobia (conducted from May 2008 to July 2008). Participants across Australia were recruited via a website. The inclusion criteria were: (i) meets criteria for the disorder of interest; (ii) aged 18 years or over; (iii) no previous history of a psychotic disorder or drug or alcohol misuse; (iv) not actively suicidal. The iCBT courses each consisted of six online lessons (to be completed within 11 weeks), homework assignments, automatic emails and resource documents.Main **outcom**e measure: The number of days absent (self-reported absenteeism) in the previous week.Results: We included 284 participants in our analysis. When data for the three disorders were combined, participants who received iCBT had significant reductions in self-reported absenteeism compared with those in **the con**trol groups (who were on a waitlist) (P = 0.03). When data for the three disorders were analysed separately, reductions in self-reported absenteeism for participants who received iCBT were not significantly different to those for participants** in the** control groups.Conclusion: Using data from five RCTs, we showed that iCBT was associated with reductions in self-reported absenteeism. Future research should focus on replicating these findings in other contexts, such as other disorders and other iCBT courses.  2014, Australasian Medical Publishing Co. Ltd.

13. **Guided Internet-Based Self-Help Intervention for Social Anxiety Disorder With Videoconferenced Therapist Support**
We describe the development of a novel, Internet-based, self-help intervention for social anxiety disorder (SAD) in adults, and report data on the preliminary efficacy of the program when administered with minimal therapist support delivered via a common videoconferencing platform. Participants (n=13) completed the intervention, which consists of 8 weekly modules and a brief weekly videoconferenced check-in with a therapist. The intervention program is derived from an acceptance-based CBT program that utilizes traditional behavioral interventions (e.g., exposure) within the context of a model emphasizing mindful awareness and psychological acceptance of distressing subjective experiences. Assessments revealed that participants experienced a significant reduction in SAD symptoms and improvements in psychosocial functioning, and that treatment gains were maintained over a 3-month follow-up period. The effect sizes for the main **outcom**e measures were large to very large (d=0.90 to 1.47), and comparable to other Internet-based treatment programs as well as in-person trials for SAD (e.g., Feske & Chambless, 1995; Tulbure, 2011). Participants also rated the treatment program as highly acceptable. This pilot study provides preliminary evidence that an Internet-based intervention grounded in basic behavioral and acceptance-based principles is effective for the treatment of SAD, and that videoconferenced therapist support may be useful in enhancing treatment compliance. Implications and future directions are discussed.  2016 eid: 2-s2.0-84944097655
14. **A Scenario-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Mobile App to Reduce Dysfunctional Beliefs in Individuals with Depression: A Randomized Controlled Trial**
Introduction: While self-administered mobile app-based **cognit**ive behavioral therapy (CBT) has shown efficiency and effectiveness over the past decade, attempts to address automatic and negative beliefs have been lacking. The purpose of this study was to introduce and verify a mobile app that directly intervenes in dysfunctional thoughts. This app-based treatment includes recognizing automatic and negative thoughts of the protagonist of scenarios, writing advice directly to the main character, and sharing advice provided by other participants. Materials and Methods: Thirty-four participants diagnosed with Other Specified **Depress**ive Disorder were recruited and randomly allocated to a CBT-based mobile-app program, the Todac Todac (TT group), or a daily mood chart app program (**control** group). Participants were asked to use the software for 3 weeks. Assessments for autonomic thoughts and clinical symptoms were administered at baseline and at a follow-up evaluation. Results: After completing the 3-week program, Dysfunctional Attitude Scale (DAS) scores in TT group were lower than they were in **the con**trol group. In clinical measures, both TT gr**oup and** control group showed reduced B**eck Dep**ression Inventory-II (BDI-II) scores and situation-dependent trait version of State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-X2) at follow-up. However, TT group showed significantly reduced STAI-X2 scores **compare**d to control group. For all participants, changes in DAS scores were correlated with BDI-II and STAI-X2 scores. Conclusions: Our preliminary findings provide promising evidence that scenario-based CBT mobile apps can be used to deliver feasible and **efficaci****ous co**gnitive therapy. Long-term research is needed to determine the impact and effectiveness of this new treatment format.  Copyright 2018, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2018. eid: 2-s2.0-85053678284
15. **PHIT for duty, a mobile approach for psychological health intervention**
The goal of this effort is to support prevention of psychological health problems through innovation in mobile personal health assessment and self-help intervention (SHI). For the U.S. military, we are developing and evaluating a fielddeployable personalized application, PHIT for Duty, to help build resilience in healthy troops and support prevention in high-risk personnel. PHIT for Duty is delivered using any smartphone or tablet with optional nonintrusive physiological and behavioral sensors for health status monitoring. The application integrates a suite of health assessments with an intelligent advisor that recommends, tailors, and presents self-help advisories. PHIT for Duty is intended for secondary prevention of psychological health problems in persons who have been exposed to psychological trauma and may be showing some symptoms of distress, but have not been diagnosed with any psychological disease or disorder.  2012 Interactive Media Institute. eid: 2-s2.0-84872023701
16. **Telephone-administered psychotherapy in combination with antidepressant medication for the acute treatment of major depressive disorder**
Background Telephone-administered psychotherapies (T-P) provided as an adjunct to anti**depress**ant medication may improve response rates in ma**jor dep**ressive disorder (MDD). The goal of this study was to compare telephone-administered social rhythm therapy (T-SRT) and telephone-administered intensive clinical management (T-ICM) as adjuncts** to ant**idepressant medication for MDD. A secondary goal was to compare T-P with Treatment as Usual (TAU) as adjunctive treatment to medication for MDD. Methods 221 adult out-patients with MDD**, curre**ntly depressed, were randomly assigned to 8 sessions of weekly T-SRT (n=110) or T-ICM (n=111), administered as an adjunct to agomelatine. Both psychotherapies were administered entirely by telephone, by trained psychologists who were blind to other aspects of treatment. The 221 patients were a posteriori m**atched **with 221 depressed outpatients receiving TAU (**control**s). The primary **outcom**e measure was the percentage of responders at 8 weeks post-treatment. Results No significant differences were found between T-SRT and T-ICM. But T-P was associated with higher response rates (65.4% vs 54.8%, p=0.02) and a trend toward higher remission rates (33.2% vs 25.1%; p=0.06) compared to TAU. Limitations Short term study. Conclusions This study is the first assessing the short-term effects of an add-on, brief, telephone-administer**ed psyc**hotherapy in depressed pa**tients **treated with antidepressant medication. Eight sessions of weekly telephone-delivered psychot**herapy **as an adjunct to antidepressant medication resulted in improved response rates relative to medication alone. eid: 2-s2.0-84944809872
17. **Trajectory of cost overtime after psychotherapy for depression in older Veterans via telemedicine**
Background Little evidence exists regarding the costs of telemedicine, especially considering changes over time. This analysis aimed to analyze trajectory of healthcare cost before, during, and after a behavioral activation intervention delivered via telepsychology and same-room delivery to elderly Veterans with **depress**ion. Methods 241 participants were randomly assigned into one of two study groups: behavioral activation **for dep**ression via telemedicine or via same-room treatment. Patients received 8 weeks of weekly 60-min individual sessions of behavioral activat**ion for** depression. Primary **outcom**es were collected at 12-months. Inpatient, outpatient, pharmacy, and total costs were collected from VA Health Economics Resource Center (HERC) datasets for FY 19982014 and compared between the two treatment groups. Generalized mixed models were used to investigate the trajectories over time. Results Overall cost, as well as, outpatient and pharmacy cost show increasing trend over time. Unadjusted and adjusted trajectories over time for any cost were not different between the two treatment groups. There was a significant overall increasing trend over time for outpatient (p<0.001) and total cost (p<0.001) but not for inpatient (p=0.543) or pharmacy cost (p=0.084). Limitations Generalizability to younger, healthier populations may be limited due to inclusion criteria for study participants. Conclusion Healthcare costs before, during, and after intervention did not differ between the telemedicine and in-person delivery methods. Outpatient costs accounted for most of the increasing trend of cost over time. These results support policies to use both telehealth and in-person treatment modalities to effectively and efficiently provide high quality care.  2016 Elsevier B.V. eid: 2-s2.0-85007545283
18. **A self-guided relaxation module for telepsychiatric services: Development, usefulness, and feasibility**
Objective: A modified form of the standard autogenic relaxation exercise was developed as part of a telepsychiatry project, which aims to deliver mental healthcare to remote areas through the net, and through the agency of non-specialists. This study describes the development and evaluation of a brief and simpler form of a relaxation technique, the Self-Guided Relaxation (SGR). Method: SGR is a systematic technique to focus on muscle groups and feel the heaviness and relaxation through suggestions to induce relaxation in the body. The SGR was taught to 37 patients with different psychiatric disorders over two sessions a week apart. Measures of change used were scores on the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) and a visual analog scale. Its usefulness and feasibility was examined over a follow-up period of one month. Additionally a group of non-specialists was trained in SGR supplemented by audiovisual aids and printed instructions. These therapists rated the ease in learning and administering SGR in patients. Results: There was a consistent reduction in the HAM-A scores over the follow-up period among patients. Improvements were also noted in positive experiences, adherence, depth of relaxation achieved, perceived benefit, and patient satisfaction. Majority of the patients, relatives, and therapists reported that they could administer or practice SGR after having learned the technique in a single session lasting about 30 minutes. The use of audio-video aids and manual was helpful in making the process of learning easy. Conclusions: Preliminary findings of usefulness, feasibility, and acceptance of the SGR were encouraging. These findings pave way for larger, randomized **control**led study and for testing applicability of the SGR as a net-based psychological intervention.  2013, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-84896463918
19. **Telephone-based care management for older adults initiated on psychotropic medication**
Objective This study aimed to explore the longitudinal, 6-month symptom course of older adults newly started on an anti**depress**ant or anxiolytic by non-psychiatrist physicians and enrolled in a care management program. Method This is a naturalistic cohort study of older adults (age 65 years) receiving pharmacotherapy and telephone-based care management. Participants are non-institutionalized adults participating in Pennsylvania's Pharmaceutical Assistance Contract for the Elderly who completed telephone-based clinical assessments including demographic data, self-report on history of psychiatric treatment and adherence, and standardized symptom scales. Results A total of 162 participants with an average age of 77.2 years (SD 6.8) were followed and, for analysis, split into two groups by PHQ-9 score: 75 (46.3%) scoring 0-4 (minimally symptomatic group, MSG) and 87 (53.7%) scoring 5 (symptomatic group, SG). Over 6 months, the SG improved with PHQ-9 scores beginning on average at 10.0 (SD 4.6) and falling to 5.4 (SD 4.2) (F(1, 86) = 29.53, p &lt; 0.0001). The MSG had no significant change** in dep**ressive symptoms. Emotional health as measured by SF-12 Mental Composite Score mirrored the PHQ-9 change and lack thereof in the SG and MSG, respectively. No clinical or demographic features were associated with symptom improvement in the SG although they were more likely to report medication adherence (66.7% vs. 44.0%, 2(1) = 8.4, p = 0.0037) compared with the MSG. Conclusions Participation of symptomatic older adults initiated on psychotropic medication in a telephone-based care management program was associated with improve**ment in** depressive symptoms and overall emotional well-being, notable findings given participants' advanced age, state-wide distribution, and history of limited utilization of mental health care.  2012 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. eid: 2-s2.0-84874702662
20. **The second randomised evaluation of the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and acceptability of computerised therapy (REEACT-2) trial: Does the provision of telephone support enhance the effectiveness of computer-delivered cognitive behaviour therapy? a randomised controlled trial**
Background: Computerised **cognit**ive behaviour therapy (cCBT) is an efficient form of therapy potentially improving access to psychological care. Indirect evidence suggests that the uptake and effectiveness of cCBT can be increased if facilitated by telephone, but this is not routinely offered in the NHS. Objectives: To compare the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of telephone-facilitated free-to-use cCBT [e.g. MoodGYM (National Institute for Mental Health Research, Australian National University, Canberra, ACT, Australia)] with minimally supported cCBT. Design: This study was a multisite, pragmatic, open, two-arm, parallel-group randomised **control**led trial with a concurrent economic evaluation. Setting: Participants were recruited from GP practices in Bristol, Manchester, Sheffield, Hull and the north-east of England. Participants: Potential participants were eligible to participate in the trial if they were adults with **depress**ion scoring  10 on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Interventions: Participants were randomised using a computer-generated random number sequence to receive minimally supported cCBT or telephone-facilitated cCBT. Participants continued with usual general practitioner care. Main **outcom**e measures: The prim**ary ou**tcome was self-reported symptoms** of dep**ression, as assessed by the PHQ-9 at 4 months post randomisation. Se**condar**y outcomes**: Seco**ndary outcom**es were** depression at 12 months and anxiety, somatoform complaints, health utility (as assessed by the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions questionnaire) and resource use at 4 and 12 months. Results: Clinical effectiveness: 182 participants were randomised to minimally supported cCBT and 187 participants to telephone-facilitated cCBT. There was a difference in the **severit**y of depression at 4 and 12 months, with lower levels in the telephone-facilitated group. The odds of **no long**er being depressed (defined as a PHQ-9 score of < 10) at 4 months were twice as high in the telephone-facilitated cCBT group [odds ratio (OR) 2.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.23 to 3.42]. The benefit of telephone-facilitated cCBT was no longer significant at 12 months (OR 1.63, 95% CI 0.98 to 2.71). At 4 months the between-group difference in PHQ-9 scores was 1.9 (95% CI 0.5 to 3.3). At 12 months the results still favoured telephone-facilitated cCBT but were no longer statistically significant, with a difference in PHQ-9 score of 0.9 (95% CI-0.5 to 2.3). When considering the whole follow-up period, telephone-facilitated cCBT was asssociated with significantly lower PHQ-9 scores than minimally supported cCBT (mean difference-1.41, 95% CI-2.63 to-0.17; p = 0.025). There was a significant improvement in anxiety scores over the trial period (between-group difference 1.1, 95% CI 0.1 to 2.3; p = 0.037). In the case of somatic complaints (assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-15), there was a borderline statistically significant difference over the trial period (between-group difference 1.1, 95% CI 0.0 to 1.8; p = 0.051). There were gains in quality-adjusted life-years at reduced cost when telephone facilitation was added to MoodGYM. However, the results were subject to uncertainty. Conclusions: The results showed short-term benefits from the addition of telephone facilitation to cCBT. The effect was small to moderate and comparable with that of other primary care psychological interventions. Telephone facilitation should be considered whe**n offer**ing cCBT for depression.

21. **The effectiveness of Telepsychiatry-Based culturally sensitive collaborative treatment for depressed Chinese American immigrants: A randomized controlled trial**
Objective: This study evaluates the effectiveness of a telepsychiatry-based culturally sensitive collaborative treatment (T-CSCT) intervention to improve **treatment **outcom****es for **depress**ed Chinese American immigrants. Methods: Participants were Chinese Americans recruited from primary care settings from February 1, 2009, to July 31, 2012, with DSM-IV ma**jor dep**ressive disorder (MDD) identified by the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview. Eligible patients were randomized to receive either T-CSCT or treatment as usual (TAU) for 6 months. T-CSCT involves (1) cultural consultation via videoconference and (2) care management. The prim**ary ou**tcome measure was the 17-item H**amilton** Depression Rating Scale (HDRS17); positive response was defined as a  50% decrease in HDRS17 score, and remission was defined as HDRS17 score  7. Se**condar**y outcome measures were the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness (CGI-S) and Improvement (CGI-I) scales and the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire** (Q-LE**S-Q). Outcomes were compared using multivariate logistic regression and mixedmodel for repeated measures methods. Results: Among participants (N = 190), 63% were female, and the mean (SD) age was 50 (14.5) years. They were randomized to T-CSCT (n = 97; 51%) or TAU (n = 93; 49%). Using multivariate logistic regression analyses, the odds of achieving response and remission were significantly greater for the T-CSCT group compared to the **control** group (odds ratio [OR] = 3.9 [95% CI, 1.9 to 7.8] and 4.4 [95% CI, 1.9 to 9.9], respectively). Multivariate general linear model analyses showed that patients in the T-CSCT group had significantly greater improvement over time in HDRS17 (F4,95 = 4.59, P = .002), CGI-S (F4,95 = 4.22, P = .003), and CGI-I (F4,95 = 2.95, P = .02) scores. Conclusions: T-CSCT is effective in improv**ing treatment ou**tcomes of Chinese immigrants with MDD.  2016 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-84989325589
22. **An internet-based self-help program for the treatment of fear of public speaking: A case study**
This article discusses the development of the first totally self-administered online CBT program for the treatment of a specific social phobia (fear of public speaking) called talk to me. The online program includes three parts. The assessment protocol gives the patient information about the problem, including impairment, severity, and the degree of fear and avoidance regarding the main feared situations. The structured treatment protocol ensures that the patient does not skip any steps in the treatment. The treatment protocol is a CBT program that provides exposure to the feared situation using videos of real audiences. Finally, the **control** protocol assesses treatment efficacy, not only at posttreatment, but also at every intermediate step. In this work we describe talk to Me and its practical application through a case study.  2008 by The Haworth Press. All rights reserved. eid: 2-s2.0-65749150568
23. **Psychotherapy for depression in older veterans via telemedicine: Effect on quality of life, satisfaction, treatment credibility, and service delivery perception**
Objective: To analyze the impact of telepsychology and sameroom care on functioning, satisfaction, and perception of care based on a noninferiority trial of psychotherapy delivered via telemedicine or same-room care to elderly patients with **depress**ion. Methods: 241 elderly patients w**ith dep**ression (meeting DSM-IV diagnostic criteria) were randomly assigned to either telemedicine (n = 120) or same-room treatment (n = 121) between April 1, 2007, and July 31, 2011. The primary **outcom**es included quality of life (36-item Short Form Survey [SF-36]), satisfaction (Charleston Psychiatric Outpatient Satisfaction Scale), treatment credibility, and service delivery perception scores obtained at 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 3 months, and 12 months. Comparisons of intervention means were carried out at each time point using independent sample t tests and SAS Procedure MIANALYZE to combine results across the multiply imputed complete data sets. If significant differences were detected for a gi**ven ou**tcome within a domain, a Bonferroni correction was applied to determine if significance was maintained. Results: None of the SF-36 scores showed a significant difference between the 2 treatment groups by the end of the study period, with little significance shown throughout the intermediate time points. Similarly, over all time points, there was no statistically significant difference in patient satisfaction or treatment credibility. Conclusions: This study found that telemedicine is a viable alternative modality for providing evidence-based psychotherapy for elderly patien**ts with** depression. Results provide evidence that quality of life and satisfaction with care are not adversely influenced by the decision to use a telehealth modality instead of in-person treatment, and, as a result, resources can be devoted to offering services in patients' homes through telemedicine.

24. **Effect of coaching on psychological adjustment in patients with spinocerebellar degeneration: A pilot study**
Objective: To examine effect of coaching intervention on psychological adjustment to illness and health-related QOL (HRQOL) in patients with spinocerebellar degeneration. Design: Randomized **control**led trial. Subjects: Twelve independently living patients with spinocerebellar degeneration aged 20-65 years old, without **cognit**ive impairment or psychiatric disorder received coaching intervention, which was postponed in another **12 (con**trol). Interventions: Three physician coaches telephoned assigned patients for 15-30 minutes in each of 10 weekly coaching sessions over three months. Main **outcom**e measures: Primary endpoints were HRQOL (SF-36) and psychological adjustment to illness (Nottingham Adjustment Scale, Japanese version; NAS-J). Results: Two-way analysis of variance (group  time) showed statistically significant main effects of time for vitality (F=5.00; P=0.036), anxiety/**depress**ion (F=5.15; P=0.033), and l**ocus of** control (F=5.58; P=0.027), indicating improvement of scores over time in both c**oaching** and control groups. No main effect of group or interaction was seen. However analysis of covariance with baseline scores as the covariate showed the coaching group to have better self-effic**acy sco**res than controls at follow-up (least-square mean, experi**mental **group, 65.1; control group, 52.7; P=0.037). Conclusion: Carefully structured telephone coaching can improve self-efficacy in patients with spinocerebellar degeneration.  Sage Publications 2007. eid: 2-s2.0-36749095747
25. **Patient acceptance of and initiation and engagement in telepsychotherapy in primary care**
Objective: The study examined factors associated with the utilization of psychotherapy offered in primary care via videoconferencing (telepsychotherapy). Methods: Primary care patients with **depress**ion (N5179) recruited from five Federally Qualified Health Centers were randomly assigned to telemedicine-based collaborative care and offered free telepsychotherapy. Independent variables included measures of access to and need for treatment. Logistic regression identified variables associated with acceptability of and initiation and engagement in telepsychotherapy. Results: To 76% of patients the idea of participating in psychotherapy was acceptable. Thirty-eight percent scheduled a telepsychotherapy session, 17% attended a session, and 8% engaged in treatment (attended at least eight sessions). Because the intervention was designed to minimize barriers, access was not a significant predictor of utilization. However, use of telepsychotherapy was associated with measures of perceived need. Conclusions: Evenwhen psychotherapy was delivered in a primary care setting via videoconferencing to minimize barriers, few patients initiated or engaged in telepsychotherapy.

26. **An internet-based cognitive-behavioral preventive intervention for complicated grief: A pilot study**
Bereaved parents and individuals bereaved by the sudden, unexpected, or violent death of a loved one are at high risk for developing complicated grief. However, preventive interventions for this at-risk population remain scarce. In the present pilot study, an Internet-based intervention for individuals bereaved in the previous 14 months was tested using a pretest/posttest design. A total of 35 bereaved individuals participated in a 3-week manualized prevention program. Counselor and participants communicated exclusively via email. The intervention consisted of the following modules: (1) describing the circumstances of the death, (2) using the life-imprint method to explore the biography and life imprint of the deceased, (3) keeping a daily diary of social activities and sleep hygiene, (4) **cognit**ive restructuring of dysfunctional thoughts, such as responsibility for the death and feelings of guilt, (5) communication within the family, (6) gender-specific coping with bereavement, and (7) bond with the deceased. Completer and intent-to-treat analyses suggest that the intervention led to a significant reduction in symptoms of complicated grief and **depress**ion at posttreatment.

27. **A comparison of mental health diagnoses treated via interactive video and face to face in the veterans healthcare administration**
Objective: This study compares the mental health diagnoses of encounters delivered face to face and via interactive video in the Veterans Healthcare Administration (VHA). Materials and Methods: We compiled 1 year of national-level VHA administrative data for Fiscal Year 2012 (FY12). Mental health encounters were those with both a VHA Mental Health Stop Code and a Mental Health Diagnosis (n=11,906,114). Interactive video encounters were identified as those with a Mental Health Stop Code, paired with a VHA Telehealth Secondary Stop Code. Primary diagnoses were grouped into posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), **depress**ion, anxiety, bipolar disorder, psychosis, drug use, alcohol use, and other. Results: In FY12, 1.5% of all mental health encounters were delivered via interactive video. Compared with face-to-face encounters, a larger percentage of interactive video encounters was for PT**SD, dep**ression, and anxiety, whereas a smaller percentage was for alcohol use, drug use, or psychosis. Conclusions: Providers and patients may feel more comfortable t**reating** depression and anxiety disorders than substance use or psychosis via interactive video.  2015, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-84936952569
28. **Predictors of dropout in face-to-face and internet-based cognitive-behavioral therapy for bulimia nervosa in a randomized controlled trial**
Objective: We sought to identify predictors and moderators of failure to engage (i.e., pretreatment attrition) and dropout in both Internet-based and traditional face-to-face **cognit**ive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for bulimia nervosa. We also sought to determine if Internet-based treatment reduced failure to engage and dropout. Method: Participants (N=191, 98% female) were randomized to Internet-based CBT (CBT4BN) or traditional face-to-face group CBT (CBTF2F). Sociodemographics, clinical history, eating disorder severity, comorbid psychopathology, health status and quality of life, personality and temperament, and treatment-related factors were investigated as predictors. Results: Failure to engage was associated with lower perceived treatment credibility and expectancy (odds ratio [OR]=0.91, 95% CI: 0.82, 0.97) and body mass index (BMI) (OR=1.10; 95% CI: 1.03, 1.18). Dropout was predicted by not having a college degree (hazard ratio [HR]=0.55; 95% CI: 0.37, 0.81), novelty seeking (HR=1.02; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.03), previous CBT experience (HR=1.77; 95% CI: 1.16, 2.71), and randomization to the individual's nonpreferred treatment format (HR=1.95, 95% CI: 1.28, 2.96). Discussion: Those most at risk of failure to engage had a higher BMI and perceived treatment as less credible and less likely to succeed. Dropout was associated with less education, higher novelty seeking, previous CBT experience, and a mismatch between preferred and assigned treatment. Contrary to expectations, Internet-based CBT did not reduce failure to engage or dropout.  2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.(Int J Eat Disord 2017; 50:569577).  2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-85006054976
29. **A pilot randomized controlled trial of videoconference-assisted treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder**
Evidence-based exposure and response prevention (ERP) treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is not always easily accessible. Long distances from specialist treatment and other practical or motivational difficulties can interfere with ERP access and **outcom**e. Delivery of ERP through telepsychology can help "fill the gap". The current study included 30 patients with OCD who were randomized to 12 weeks of either videoconference-assisted ERP (VCT; N=10), self-help ERP (S-H, N=10), or a wait-list condition (W-L, N=10). The VCT format included use of tablet-based videoconferencing sessions (N=6) or studio-based videoconference (N=4), as well as telephone calls. Patients rated the VCT format as natural and reported strong working alliances with their therapists. VCT treatment produced significantly greater reductions in obsessive-compulsive symptoms compared to the two **control** conditions. **Treatm**ent ou**tcom**es were similar to that of regular face-to-face ERP and improvements in symptom scores remained stable at follow-up. The study indicated that ERP for OCD can be delivered efficiently with videoconferencing technology along with telephone calls. The use of such technology in psychological treatment is likely to become more common in the future and it holds promise as a method to make evidence-based treatment more accessible.  2014 Elsevier Ltd. eid: 2-s2.0-84909588326
30. **Acceptance of home-based telehealth problem-solving therapy for depressed, low-income homebound older adults: Qualitative interviews with the participants and aging-service case managers**
Purpose: To report low-income homebound older adults' experience of telehealth problem-solving therapy (tele-PST) and aging-service case managers' (CMs') experience/perception of client-level personal barriers to accessing psychotherapy in general and PST specifically. Design and Methods: The study sample consisted of 42 homebound older adults who participated in the feasibility and efficacy trial of tele-PST and completed 36-week follow-up assessments and 12 CMs of a large home-delivered meals program who referred their clients to the tele-PST trial. In-depth interviews with the older adults and written feedback and focus group discussions with the CMs provided the data. Results: Older adults reported a high rate of approval of PST procedures and acknowledged its positive treatment effect. Tele-PST participants were satisfied with videoconferenced sessions because they were convenient and allowed them to see their therapist. However, CMs reported that only about 10%-20% of potentially eligible older adults gave oral consent for PST. Significant treatment engagement barriers were the older adults' lack of motivation, denial of **depress**ion, perceived stigma, and other personal attitudinal factors. Implications: The real-world implementation of tele-PST or other psychotherapies needs to include educating and motivat**ing dep**ressed homebound elders to recogniz**e their** depression and accept treatment.  2013 The Author. eid: 2-s2.0-84905013447

Objective: This randomized-**control**led experimental study was conducted to determine the effects of psychoeducation in the inpatient clinic and regular telepsychiatric follow-up (via telephone) after discharge on emotional expression, **depress**ion and family burden of primary caregivers of the schizophrenic patients. Methods: This study was performed on 62 caregivers of the schizophrenic patients, assigned to experiment (n=32) **and con**trol (n=30) groups, from 1st July 2010 to 31st May 2011. The Scales for Expressed Emotion, the B**eck Dep**ression and the Zarit Family Burden were applied for the caregivers in experim**ent and** control groups before education, after education and after 6-months telephone follow-up. Results: The mean scores of the caregivers in experiment group on family burden, emotional express**ion and** depression were decreased after education and after telephone follow-up and difference was significant (p &lt; 0.001). Conclusions: Psychoeducation and telepsychiatric follow-up via telephone induced decrease in family burden, emotional exp**ression** and depressive symptoms for their caregivers and was a support for the family in the patient care. eid: 2-s2.0-84881589469
32. **Telepsychology and Self-help: The Treatment of Fear of Public Speaking**
This work presents a self-help, Internet-based telepsychology program for the treatment of public speaking fears. The system is comprised of 3 parts: The assessment protocol gives the patient information about his or her problem (i.e., amount of interference it creates in his or her life, severity, degree of fear and avoidance). The system also includes a structured treatment protocol, organized into separate blocks, reflecting the patient's progress. This ensures that the patient does not skip any steps in the treatment (something quite common in traditional self-help manuals), which provides more **control** over the process. The treatment protocol is a **cognit**ive-behavioral program that provides exposure to the feared situation using videos of real audiences. Finally, **the con**trol protocol assesses treatment efficacy, not only at closure, but also at every intermediate step. Efficacy data from 12 social phobia patients are presented from pretreatment to posttreatment and at 1-month follow-up. These preliminary data support the efficacy of our telepsychology program for the treatment of fear of public speaking. This is a preliminary work in a promising research path that examines the possibility of using the Internet for the treatment of psychological disorders.  2006. eid: 2-s2.0-33846672733
33. **An open trial of videoconference-mediated exposure and ritual prevention for obsessive-compulsive disorder**
The gold-standard treatment for OCD is exposure and ritual prevention (ERP), yet despite its well-established efficacy, only a small percentage of OCD patients have access to this treatment. Remote treatments (e.g., videoconferencing) are becoming increasingly popular avenues for treatment delivery and show promise in increasing patient access to evidence-based mental health care. The current pilot study utilized an open trial to examine the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of videoconference-mediated, twice weekly, ERP for adults (n= 15) with OCD. Results revealed that ERP was associated with significant improvements in OCD symptoms and large within-group effect sizes. Among the 10 individuals who completed a 3-month follow-up assessment, 30% of participants no longer met DSM-IV-TR criteria for OCD and 80% of participants were rated as very much or much improved on the CGI. This study adds to the growing body of literature suggesting that videoconference-based interventions are viable alternatives to face-to-face treatment.  2014 Elsevier Ltd. eid: 2-s2.0-84901432153
34. **Telepsychiatry evaluation in the north-west of England: Preliminary results of a qualitative study**
A telepsychiatry referral service for patients suffering from anxiety and **depress**ion was evaluated from a user perspective. Low-cost video-phones linked a psychiatrist to two general practices in the north-west of England. Quantitative data were collected using a semistructured interview schedule. Twenty-two patients and 13 doctors were interviewed after a video-link consultation. Some users were very positive about the service and recognized its potential benefits, while others were more ambivalent. Patients saw the service as a means of obtaining additional 'expert' advice. General practitioners felt that the service might adversely affect the doctor-patient relationship in psychiatry. Both patients and clinicians recognized that the video-link modified normal interaction. Users need to adapt to this form of communication. An induction session is recommended for both patients and clinicians. eid: 2-s2.0-0002345539
35. **A study of the effectiveness of telepsychiatry-based culturally sensitive collaborative treatment of depressed Chinese Americans**
Background: Chinese American patients with Major **Depress**ive Disorder (MDD) tend to underutilize mental health services and are more likely to seek help in primary care settings than from mental health specialists. Our team has reported that Culturally Sensitive Collaborative Treatment (CSCT) is effective in improving re**cognit**ion and treatment engagement** of dep**ressed Chinese Americans in primary care. The current study builds on this prior research by incorporating telemedicine technology into the CSCT model.Methods/Design: We propose a randomized **control**led trial to evaluate the acceptability and effectiveness of a telepsychiatry-based culturally sensitive collaborative treatment (T-CSCT) intervention targeted toward Chinese Americans. Patients meeting the study's eligibility criteria will receive either treatment as usual or the intervention under investigation. The six-month intervention involves: 1) an initial psychiatric interview using a culturally sensitive protocol via videoconference; 2) eight scheduled phone visits with a care manager assigned to the patient, who will monitor the patient's progress, as well as medication side effects and dosage if applicable; and 3) collaboration between the patient's PCP, psychiatrist, and care manager. **Outcom**e measures **include** depressive symptom severity as well as patient and PCP satisfaction with the telepsychiatry-based care management service.Discussion: The study investigates the T-CSCT model, which we believe will increase the feasibility and practicality of the CSCT model by adopting telemedicine technology. We anticipate that this model will expand access to culturally competent psychiatrists fluent in patients' native languages to improve t**reatmen**t of depressed minority patients in primary care settings.Trial Registration: NCT00854542.  2011 Yeung et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd. eid: 2-s2.0-80053372067
36. **Adolescent and parent experiences with a primary care/Internet-based depression prevention intervention (CATCH-IT)**
This article describes a mixed-methods approach to understand the experience of adolescents involved in the Internet-based intervention for **depress**ion, Competent Adulthood Transition with **Cognit**ive Behavioral Humanistic and Interpersonal Training (CATCH-IT), as well as the experiences of their parents while they were involved. Qualitative analysis was done with grounded theory-based categorization of interview comments and typed program responses (adolescents only) into themes. Quantitative analysis was done with self-report surveys. The article describes the nine themes reflecting the adolescent experience and the three themes reflecting the parent experience. The article also describes the results of the quantitative surveys of helpfulness and attitudes change, which were favorable of the Internet-based intervention. Separate models explaining the psychological transformation of the adolescents and the experience of the parents are proposed. The positive experience of the adolescents and parents involved in CATCH-IT is discussed in the context of growing interest in how best to utilize Internet-based interventions for mental illness, and suggestions are made for future investigation.  2011 Elsevier Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-82855175151
37. **Pilot randomised controlled trial of Help4Mood, an embodied virtual agent-based system to support treatment of depression**
Introduction: Help4Mood is an interactive system with an embodied virtual agent (avatar) to assist in self-monitoring of patients receiving treatment for **depress**ion. Help4Mood supports self-report and biometric monitoring and includes elements of **cognit**ive behavioural therapy. We aimed to evaluate system use and acceptability, to explore likely recruitment and retention rates in a clinical trial and to obtain an estimate of potential treatment response with a view to conducting a future randomised **control**led trial (RCT). Methods: We conducted a pilot RCT of Help4Mood in three centres, in Romania, Spain and Scotland, UK. Patients with diagno**sed dep**ression** (major** depressive disorder) and current mi**ld/mode**rate depressive symptoms were randomised to use the system for four weeks in addition to treatment as usual (TAU) or to TAU alone. Results: Twenty-seven individuals were randomised and follow-up data were obtained from 21 participants (12/13 Help4Mood, 9/14 TAU). Half of participants randomised to Help4Mood used it regularly (more than 10 times); none used it every day. Acceptability varied between users. Some valued the emotional responsiveness of the system, while others found it too repetitive. Intention to treat analysis showed a small difference in** change** of Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-2) scores (Help4Mood 5.7 points, TAU 4.2). Post-hoc on-treatment analysis suggested that participants who used Help4Mood regularly experienced a median change in BDI-2 of 8 points. Conclusion: Help4Mood is acceptable to some patients rece**iving t**reatment for depression although none used it as regularly **as inte**nded. Changes in depression symptoms in individuals who used the system regularly reached potentially meaningful levels.  2015,  The Author(s) 2015. eid: 2-s2.0-84983070104
38. **Comorbid Anxiety Disorders and Treatment of Depression in People With Multiple Sclerosis**
Objective: Anxiety is highly comorbid with **depress**ion, but little is known about the impact of anxiety disorders on the effectiveness of empirically supported psychotherapies **for dep**ression. We examined such **outcom**es for people with Multiple Sclerosis (**MS) and** depression, with versus without comorbid anxiety disorders. Design: Participants with MS (N = 102) received 16 weeks of telephone-administered psycho**therapy** for depression and were followed for one year post-treatment. Results: Participants with comorbid anxiety disorders improved to a similar degree during treatment as those without anxiety disorde**rs. Ou**tcomes during follow-up were mixed, and thus we divided the anxiety diagnoses into distress and fear disorders. The distress disorder (GAD) was associated with elevated anxiety symptoms during and after treatment. In contrast, fear disorders (i.e., panic disorder, agoraphobia, social phobia, specific phobia)** were l**inked to depression, specifically during follow-up, across 3 different measures. Conclusions: People with GAD rece**iving t**reatment for depression may benefit from additional services targeting anxiety more specifically, while those with comorbid fear disorders may benefit from services targeting maintenance of gains after treatment.  2010 American Psychological Association. eid: 2-s2.0-77956497074
39. **Feasibility and impact of telemonitor-based depression care management for geriatric homecare patients**
Objective: The objective of this study was to test the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary clinical **outcom**es of a method to leverage existing home healthcare telemonitoring technology to deliver **depress**ion care management (DCM) to both Spanish- and English-speaking elderly homebound recipients of homecare services. Materials and Methods: Three stand-alone, nonprofit community homecare agencies located in New York, Vermont, and Miami participated in this study. Evidence-based DCM was adapted to the telemonitor platform by programming questions and educational information** on dep**ression sympto**ms, ant**idepressant adherence, and side effects. Recruited patients participated for a minimum of 3 weeks. Telehealth nurses were trained on DCM and received biweekly supervision. On-site trained research assistants conducted in-home research in**terview**s on depression diagnosis and severity and patient satisfaction with the protocol. Results: An ethnically diverse sample of 48 English- and Spanish-only-speaking patients participated, along with seven telehealth nurses. Both patients and telehealth nurses reported high levels of protocol acceptance. Among 19 patients meeting diagnostic cri**teria f**or major d**epressi**on, the mean depression severity was in the "markedly severe" range at baseline and in the "mild" range at follow-up. Conclusions: Results of this pilot support the feasibility of using homecare's existing telemonitoring technology to deliver DCM to their elderly homebound patients. This was true for both English- and Spanish-speaking patients. Preliminary clini**cal ou**tcomes** sugges**t improvement in depression severity, although these findings require testing in a randomized clinical trial. Implications for the science and **service** of telehealth-based depression care for elderly patients are discussed.  Copyright 2011, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2011. eid: 2-s2.0-80053250021
40. **Willingness to use telemedicine for psychiatric care**
The aim of this study was to assess potential users' willingness to use telepsychiatry and its correlates within a theoretical framework guided by the principles of social-**cognit**ive models. The conceptual model proposed willingness to use telepsychiatry to be associated directly to attitudes toward telemedicine, attitudes toward the patient-physician relationship, and satisfaction with current medical care, and indirectly to anxiety to technology. Phone interviews were conducted with a representative sample of 1,204 Jewish, noninstitutionalized adults in Israel (mean age = 58; 51% female). Structural equation modeling was used to examine hypothesized relationships. Willingness to use telepsychiatry was relatively high and was affected by the participants' attitudes toward telemedicine, the patient-physician relationship, and by the level of anxiety toward technology. Efforts aimed at encouraging the use of telemedicine for psychiatric care should target potential users' attitudes, as well as feelings of uneasiness and anxiety regarding technology. eid: 2-s2.0-4744357454
41. **Predictors of 12-month outcome in smokers who received bupropion sustained-release for smoking cessation**
Aim: To examine heterogeneity in **outcom**e at 12 months following 8 weeks of treatment for smoking cessation with bupropion sustained-release (SR) 150 or 300 mg/day combined with behavioural counselling. Design, setting, participants: Smokers were recruited from a large healthcare system and then randomized to receive either bupropion SR 150 mg/day (n = 763) or 300 mg/day (n = 761) taken for 8 weeks in combination with either proactive telephone counselling or a tailored mail approach. Measurements and findings: A comprehensive set of relevant individual pretreatment and treatment characteristics was included in the analysis. Smok**ing ou**tcome at 12 months was defined as point-prevalence of any regular self-reported smoking within the 7 days prior to follow-up contact. Classification and regression tree analysis identified subgroups that varied with respect to likelihood of being nonsmokers at 12 months. Seven subgroups were identified among those receiving bupropion SR 150 mg/day (proportion of nonsmokers at 12 months ranged from 13.7% to 43.5%) and eight subgroups among those receiving bupropion SR 300 mg/day (proportion of nonsmokers at 12 months ranged from 9.6% to 51.7%). In the 150-mg/day group, those with the lowest rate reported no previous quit attempt of 1 month or more in duration while those with the highest rate all reported previous quit attempts of 1 month or longer. In the 300 mg/day group, those with the lowest rate had very high levels of dependence while those with the highest rate were more highly educated and smoked at a lower level. Across all subgroups, cost per 12-month quitter ranged from a low of $US302 to a high of $US2502. Conclusions: These results indicate the presence of a substantial amount of varia**tion i**n outcome following treatment with both dosages of bupropion SR, with substantial cost consequences. V**ariati**on in outcome could be reduced by providing treatments tailored to subgroups of individuals who are at exceptionally high risk for smoking following a quit attempt.  2008 Adis Data Information BV.

42. **Generic versus disorder specific cognitive behavior therapy for socialanxiety disorder in youth: A randomized controlled trial usinginternet delivery**
The study examined whether the efficacy of **cognit**ive behavioral treatment for Social Anxiety Disorder for children and adolescents is increased if intervention addresses speci**fic co**gnitive and behavioral factors linked to the development and maintenance of SAD in young people, over and above the traditional generic CBT approach. Participants were 125 youth, aged 817 years, with a primary diagnosis of SAD, who were randomly assigned to generic CBT (CBT-GEN), social anxiety specific CBT (CBT-SAD) or a wait list **control** (WLC). Intervention was delivered using a therapist-supported online program. After 12-weeks, participants who received treatment (CBT-SAD or CBT-GEN) showed significantly greater reduction in social anxiety and post-event processing, and greater improvement in global functioning than the WLC but there was no significant difference between CBT-SAD and CBT-GEN on any **outcom**e variable at 12-weeks or 6-month follow-up. Despite significant reductions in anxiety, the majority in both treatment conditions continued to meet diagnostic criteria for SAD at 6-month follow-up. Decreases in social anxiety were associated with decreases in post-event processing. Future research should continue to investigate disorder-specific interventions for SAD in young people, drawing on evidence regarding causal or maintaining factors, in order to enhance **treatm**ent ou**tcom**es for this debilitating condition.  2016 Elsevier Ltd eid: 2-s2.0-85006141751
43. **Automated depression screening in disadvantaged pregnant women in an urban obstetric clinic**
Objective: A promising means of screening for **depress**ion among high-risk perinatal women involves interactive voice response (IVR) technology in which patients self-enter data into a database using a touch tone telephone. Our aim was to test the feasibility of using IVR to screen **for dep**ression among low-income, urban pregnant patients and to solicit their preferences for treatment. Methods: The study population included a convenience sample of English-speaking pregnant patients awaiting routine prenatal visits in an urban obstetric clinic. Consenting subjects used a phone in a private clinic room to complete an IVR version of the Edinburgh Po**stnatal** Depression Scale (EPDS). Patients scoring **in the **"not depressed" range were branched to a closing message while those with** mild t**o severe depressive symptoms were branched to additional automated questions about their treatment preferences. Results: All 54 participants who consented to the study were able to complete the IVR phone session. More than 90% expressed willingness to complete IVR interviews as part of routine prenatal and postpartum care. Sixteen out of 54 participants (29.6%) scored in the moderate **to seve**re range for depressive symptoms (EPDS  12) which was consistent with a prior study in the same population using a validated paper-pencil screen. **Only 12** out of 21 (57%) depressed subjects indicated a desire to speak with a health care provider about how they are fee**ling. T**he majority of these depressed subjects preferred to speak with a social worker about housing or financial problems (92%) or an obstetrician or midwife (83%), while a minority (42%) wanted to speak with a mental health professional. Conclusions: This pilot study suggests that it is feasible to use an automate**d phone** interview to screen for depression in low-income, urban pregnant women.  2007 Springer-Verlag. eid: 2-s2.0-34547734529
44. **Telepsychology and self-help: The treatment of phobias using the internet**
One of the challenges today in the research of psychological treatments based on evidence is their dissemination. **Efficaci**ous and effective psychological treatments should be available and accessible for both practitioners and consumers. However, only a small percentage of potential patients actively seek help for psychological problems that could be ameliorated by therapy. Internet-based self-help interventions may help to solve this problem by reducing the amount of actual contact between therapist and patient and by overcoming the geographical barriers that separate them. The aim of this work is to present a completely self-applied telepsychology program (Without Fear) to treat small animal phobia (spiders, cockroaches, and mice), which uses virtual reality scenarios for the exposure tasks. Preliminary data about the efficacy and effectiveness of this program in a series of 12 cases is offered. Participants showed an improvement in all clinical measures at posttreatment, and the therapeutic gains were maintained at a 3-month followup.  2008 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-57649119958
45. **Comparing in-person to videoconference-based cognitive behavioral therapy for mood and anxiety disorders: Randomized controlled trial**
Background: **Cognit**ive-behavioral therapy (CBT) has demonstrated efficacy and effectiveness for treating mood and anxiety disorders. Dissemination of CBT via videoconference may help improve access to treatment. Objective: The present study aimed to compare the effectiveness of CBT administered via videoconference to in-person therapy for a mixed diagnostic cohort. Methods: A total of 26 primarily Caucasian clients (mean age 30 years, SD 11) who had a primary Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition text revision (DSM-IV-TR) diagnosis of a mood or anxiety disorder were randomly assigned to receive 12 sessions of CBT either in-person or via videoconference. Treatment involved individualized CBT formulations specific to the presenting diagnosis; all sessions were provided by the same therapist. Participants were recruited through a university clinic. Symptoms of **depress**ion, anxiety, stress, and quality of life were assessed using questionnaires before, after, and 6 weeks following treatment. Secondary **outcom**es at posttreatment included working alliance and client satisfaction. Results: Retention was similar across treatment conditions; there was one more client in the videoconferencing condition at posttreatment and at follow-up. Statistical analysis using multilevel mixed effects linear regression indicated a significant reduction in client symptoms across time for symptoms** of dep**ression (P<.001, d=1.41), anxiety (P<.001, d=1.14), stress (P<.001, d=1.81), and quality of life (P<.001, d=1.17). There were no significant differences between treatment conditions regarding symp**toms of** depression (P=.165, d=0.37), anxiety (P=.41, d=0.22), stress (P=.15, d=0.38), or quality of life (P=.62, d=0.13). There were no significant differences in client rating of the working alliance (P=.53, one-tailed, d=-0.26), therapist ratings of the working alliance (P=.60, one-tailed, d=0.23), or client ratings of satisfaction (P=.77, one-tailed, d=-0.12). Fisher's Exact P was not significant regarding differences in reliable change from pre- to posttreatment or from pretreatment to follow-up for **symptom**s of depression (P=.41, P=.26), anxiety (P=.60, P=.99), or quality of life (P=.65, P=.99) but was significant for symptoms of stress in favor of the videoconferencing condition (P=.03, P=.035). Difference between conditions regarding clinically significant change was also not observed from pre- to posttreatment or from pretreatment to follow-up **for sym**ptoms of depression (P=.67, P=.30), anxiety (P=.99, P=.99), stress (P=.19, P=.13), or quality of life (P=.99, P=.62). Conclusions: The findings of this **control**led trial indicate that CBT was effective in significantly r**educing** symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress and increasing quality of life in both in-person and videoconferencing conditions, with no significant differences being observed between the two. eid: 2-s2.0-84887863626
46. **Evaluating an e-mental health program (deprexis) as adjunctive treatment tool in psychotherapy for depression: Results of a pragmatic randomized controlled trial**
Background **Depress**ive disorders place a significant disease burden on individuals as well as on societies. Several web-based interventions **for dep**ression have shown to be effective in r**educing** depressive symptoms. However, it is not known whether web-based interventions, when used as adjunctive treatment tools to regular psychotherapy, have an additional effect compared to regular psycho**therapy** for depression. Methods Adults (N = 98) with a unipolar affective disorder were recruited in routine outpatient psychotherapy practices in Germany from therapists over the course of their initial sessions and randomized within therapists to one of two active treatment conditions: regular psychotherapy or psychotherapy p**lus a w**eb-based depression program (deprexis). **Primary** **outcom**e was depressive symptoms** measur**ed with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) at 12 weeks. Second**ary ou**tcomes were anxiety symptoms, somatic symptoms and quality of life at 12 weeks and six months follow-up. The study also included an assessment of the working alliance after six and 12 weeks. Results The combination of psychotherapy with the web-based program was more effective than psychotherapy alone at 12 weeks, with medium between-gr**oup eff**ect sizes on primary depressive symptoms (Cohen's d =.51) and small to medium between-group effect sizes on se**condar**y outcomes (Cohen's d =.07.55). Furthermore, we did not observe negative side effects in the blended format, e.g., a lower working alliance than in psychotherapy alone. Limitations The study had a smaller than planned sample size and the dropout rate at follow-up was high. Conclusions This study provides first evidence that the use of a web-based program as an adjunctive tool in regular psychotherapy could be a promising option to c**onsider** in future treatment for depression.  2017 Elsevier B.V. eid: 2-s2.0-85034089945
47. **The acceptability of an Internet-based self-help treatment for fear of public speaking**
Several randomised ****control**led studi**es have shown the efficacy of Internet-based self-help treatments. These studies have centred their attention on axis I (efficacy) of the Guidelines for Empirically Validated Treatments, although there are a few studies that also take into account axis II (effectiveness). The aim of the present work was to test the acceptability of an Internet-based self-help program for fear of public speaking and to compare its acceptability with the same treatment administered by a therapist. Fifty-two participants suffering from social phobia were randomly selected to take part in one of these treatments. All participants reported being satisfied with the treatment received, and results did not show significant differences between both treatments. These **outcom**es were maintained at 12-month follow-ups.  2009 Taylor & Francis. eid: 2-s2.0-70449464721
48. **A randomized controlled trial of telephone-delivered cognitive-behavioral therapy for late-life anxiety disorders**
OBJECTIVES: Older adults face a number of barriers to receiving psychotherapy, such as a lack of transportation and access to providers. One way to overcome such barriers is to provide treatment by telephone. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of **cognit**ive behavioral therapy delivered by telephone (CBT-T) to older adults diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. DESIGN: Randomized **control**led trial. SETTING: Participants' homes. PARTICIPANTS: Sixty participants age 60 and older with a diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, or anxiety disorder not otherwise specified. INTERVENTION: CBT-T versus information-only comparison. MEASUREMENTS: Coprimary **outcom**es included worry (Penn State Worry Questionnaire) and general anxiety (State Trait Anxiety Inventory). Second**ary ou**tcomes included clinician-rated anxiety (Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale), anxiety sensitivity (Anxiety Sensitivity Index), **depress**ive symptoms (B**eck Dep**ression Inventory), quality of life (SF-36), and sleep (Insomnia Severity Index). Assessments were completed prior to randomization, immediately upon completion of treatment, and 6 months after completing treatment. RESULTS: CBT-T was superior to information-only in reducing general anxiety (ES = 0.71), worry (ES = 0.61), anxiety sensitivity (ES = 0.85), and insomnia (ES = 0.82) at the posttreatment assessment; however, only the reductions in worry were maintained by the 6-month follow-up assessment (ES = 0.80). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that CBT-T may be **efficaci**ous in reducing anxiety and worry in older adults, but additional sessions may be needed to maintain these effects.  2012 American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry. eid: 2-s2.0-84864241378
49. **Use of standard webcam and internet equipment for telepsychiatry treatment of depression among underserved hispanics**
Objective: **Depress**ion affects nearly one in five Americans at some time in their life, causing individual suffering and financial cost. The Internet has made it possible to deliver telemedicine care economically to areas and populations with limited access to specialist or culturally and linguistically congruent care. Methods: This study compared the effectiveness for Hispanic patients** of dep**ression treatment provided by a psychiatrist through Internet videoconferencing (Webcam intervention) and treatment as usual by a primary care provider. Adults (N=167) with a diagn**osis of** depression were recruited from a community clinic and were randomly assigned to treatment condition. Webcam participants met remotely each month with the psychiatrist, and treatment-as-usual patients received customary care from their primary care providers, all for six months. At baseline and three and six months, analyses of variance tested differences between conditions i**n score**s on depression rating scales and quality-of-life and functional ability measures. Results: All participants experienced an** improv**ement in depression symptoms. Ratings on th**e Montg**omery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale by clinicians blind to treatment group and self-ratings on the nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire, Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire, and Sheehan Disability Scale showed a significant main effect of time. On all four measures, a significant interaction of time by intervention favoring the Webcam group was noted. Discussion: Results suggest that telepsychiatry delivered through the Internet utilizing commercially available domestic Webcams and standard Internet and computer equipment is effective and acceptable. Use of this technology may help close the gap in access to culturally and linguistically congruent specialists. Copyright  American Psychiatric Association. eid: 2-s2.0-84878320324
50. **Design and implementation of the Telemedicine-Enhanced Antidepressant Management Study**
Objective: Evidence-based practices designed for large urban clinics are not necessarily transportable into small rural practices. Implementing collaborative care for **depress**ion in small rural primary care clinics presents unique challenges because it is typically not feasible to employ on-site mental health specialists. The purpose of the Telemedicine-Enhanced **Antidep**ressant Management (TEAM) study was to evaluate a collaborative care model adapted for small rural clinics using telemedicine technologies. The purpose of this paper is to describe the TEAM study design. Method: The TEAM study was conducted in small rural Veterans Administration community-based outpatient clinics with interactive video equipment available for mental health, but no on-site psychiatrists/psychologists. The study attempted to enroll all patient**s whose** depression could be appropriately treated in primary care. Results: The clinical characteristics of the 395 study participants differed significantly from most previous trials of collaborative care. At baseline, 41% were already receiving p**rimary **care depression treatment. Study participants averaged 5.5 chronic physical health illnesses and 56.5% had a comorbid anxiety disorder. Over half (57.2%) reported that pain impaired their functioning extremely or quite a bit. Conclusions: Despite small patient populations in rural clinics, enoug**h patie**nts with depression can be successfully enrolled to evaluate telemedicine-based collaborative care.  2006 Elsevier Inc.

51. **Treatment of Social Anxiety Disorder Using Online Virtual Environments in Second Life**
Over 80% of people with social anxiety disorder (SAD) do not receive any type of treatment, despite the existence of effective evidence-based treatments. Barriers to treatment include lack of trained therapists (particularly in nonmetropolitan areas), logistical difficulties (e.g., cost, time, transportation), concerns regarding social stigma, and fear of negative evaluation from health care providers. Interventions conducted through electronic communication media, such as the Internet, have the potential to reach individuals who otherwise would not have access to evidence-based treatments. Second Life is an online virtual world that holds great promise in the widespread delivery of evidence-based treatments. We assessed the feasibility, acceptability, and initial efficacy of an acceptance-based behavior therapy in Second Life to treat adults with generalized SAD. Participants (n= 14) received 12 sessions of weekly therapy and were assessed at pretreatment, midtreatment, posttreatment, and follow-up. Participants and therapists rated the treatment program as acceptable and feasible, despite frequently encountered technical difficulties. Analyses showed significant pretreatment to follow-up improvements in social anxiety symptoms, **depress**ion, disability, and quality of life, with effect sizes comparable to previously published results of studies delivering in-person **cognit**ive behavior therapy for SAD. Implications and future directions are discussed.  2012. eid: 2-s2.0-84872289268
52. **Feasibility and acceptability of clinic-based telepsychiatry for low-income hispanic primary care patients**
Background: The feasibility and acceptability of telepsychiatry for low-income Hispanic patients with major **depress**ion were assessed. Subjects and Methods: In total, 167 adult Hispanic patients with ma**jor dep**ression recruited from a community health center (CHC) were randomly assigned to receive psychiatry services through a video Webcam (WEB) (n=80) or to treatment as usual (TAU) (n=87). The WEB condition consisted of monthly telepsychiatry sessions at the CHC for 6 months provided by one of two Hispanic psychiatrists using an online virtual meeting program. TAU patients received their care from their providers. Acceptability was assessed by comparing appointment keeping for primary care versus telepsychiatry, patients' perceived working alliance with their provider, visit satisfaction, **and ant**idepressant use. Feasibility was ass**essed u**sing depression **outcom**es, functional days (unproductive or days lost), and whether WEB and TAU patients differed in their appointment keeping. Results: WEB patients did not differ in the proportion of completed primary care versus telepsychiatry appointments and rated their working alliance with the psychiatrist and their visit satisfaction significantly higher than the TAU patients with their provider. Significantly more WEB than TAU pa**tients **used antide**pressan**ts. Although depression severity decreased faster among WEB than TAU patients, no differences we**re foun**d in the overall depression score. WEB and TAU patients did not differ in the number of days that were **lost or** unproductive due to depression. Although WEB and TAU patients reported being willing to pay for mental health services provided by the CHC, almost proportionately twice as many WEB patients were willing to pay for telepsychiatry. Conclusions: R**esults **show that for low-income depressed Hispanic p**atients**, telepsychiatry service for depression is acceptable, although its feasibility is questionable. The benefits of telemedicine were discussed in terms of improving patient care in ways other than directly providing services to the patients.

53. **Acceptance based behavior therapy for social anxiety disorder through videoconferencing**
Most individuals with social anxiety disorder (SAD) do not receive any type of treatment. Reasons include logistical barriers (e.g., geographic location, travel time), fear of stigmatization, and fear of the social interactions associated with seeking treatment. Videoconferencing technology holds great promise in the widespread delivery of evidence-based treatments to those who would otherwise not receive treatment. This pilot study assessed the feasibility, acceptability, and initial efficacy of an acceptance-based behavioral intervention using Skype videoconferencing to treat adults with generalized SAD. Twenty-four participants received 12 sessions of weekly therapy and were assessed at pre-treatment, mid-treatment, post-treatment, and 3-month follow-up. Participants and therapists rated the intervention as acceptable and feasible. Analyses revealed significant pre-treatment to follow-up improvements in social anxiety, **depress**ion, disability, quality of life, and experiential avoidance, with effect sizes comparable to or larger than previously published results of studies delivering in-person CBT for SAD. Implications and future directions are discussed.  2013 Elsevier Ltd. eid: 2-s2.0-84879799248

Background: Promising evidence has emerged of clinical gains using guided self-help **cognit**ive-behavioural therapy (CBT) for child anxiety and by involving parents in treatment; however, the efficacy of guided parent-delivered CBT has not been systematically evaluated in UK primary and secondary settings. Aims: To evaluate the efficacy of low-intensity guided parent-delivered CBT treatments for children with anxiety disorders. Method: A total of 194 children presenting with a current anxiety disorder, whose primary carer did not meet criteria for a current anxiety disorder, were randomly allocated to full guided parent-delivered CBT (four face-to-face and four telephone sessions) or brief guided parent-delivered CBT (two face-to-face and two telephone sessions), or a wait-list **control** group (trial registration: ISRCTN92977593). Presence and severity of child primary anxiety disorder (Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule for DSM-IV, child/parent versions), improvement in child presentation of anxiety (Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scale), and change in child anxiety symptoms (Spence Children's Anxiety Scale, child/parent version and Child Anxiety Impact scale, parent version) were assessed at post-treatment and for those in the two active treatment groups, 6 months posttreatment. Results: Full guided parent-delivered CBT produced superior diagnostic **outcom**es compared with wait-list at posttreatment, whereas brief guided parent-delivered CBT did not: at post-treatment, 25 (50%) of those in the full guided CBT group had recovered from their primary diagnosis, compared with 16 (25%) of those on the wait-list (relative risk (RR) 1.85, 95% CI 1.14-2.99); and in the brief guided CBT group, 18 participants (39%) had recovered from their primary diagnosis post-treatment (RR = 1.56, 95% CI 0.89-2.74). Level of therapist training and experience was unrelated to ch**ild ou**tcome. Conclusions: Full guided parent-delivered CBT is an effective and inexpensive first-line treatment for child anxiety. eid: 2-s2.0-84890261772
55. **Clinical outcomes in telepsychiatry**
A retrospective review of patient records comparing clinical **outcom**es of patients seen by interactive television (IATV) and those seen in person was carried out to determine whether IATV reduced the quality of psychiatric care. A Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) score was determined for each patient in both the study and **control** groups at the initial visit, and at subsequent visits. Forty-nine patients with either major **depress**ion or schizoaffective disorder were studied. No significant difference was found in the percentage change in GAF scores between the two groups, which suggests that clini**cal ou**tcomes were not affected by the use of IATV. Patients seen by IATV had a greater attendance rate and follow-up visits took less than half the time compared with in-person visits, indicating that IATV was an acceptable and efficient method of providing psychiatric services. eid: 2-s2.0-0032613658
56. **The SmartCAT: An m-health platform for ecological momentary intervention in child anxiety treatment**
Introduction: **Cognit**ive behavioral therapy (CBT) for child anxiety, although **efficaci**ous, typically requires 16-20 weekly sessions with a therapist. Brief CBT (BCBT; eight sessions) for child anxiety is promising but may have less favorable **outcom**es owing to reduced session time. Mobile health (m-health) has the potential to improve BCBT efficacy by delivering ecological momentary intervention to engage youth in learning and practicing CBT skills in their everyday lives (in vivo). Materials and Methods: We developed an m-health platform entitled SmartCAT (Smartphone-enhanced Child Anxiety Treatment). SmartCAT consists of (1) a smartphone application (app) that cues youth to use the CBT skills taught in sessions, (2) an online portal that allows therapists to monitor skill use, to send cues and treatment-related materials, to engage youth in real-time via secure messages, and to manage rewards, and (3) a communication protocol that allows real-time bidirectional exchange between the app and the portal. A pilot study with nine youth (9-14 years old) examined the platform's feasibility as an adjunct to BCBT. Results: SmartCAT was found to be capable of supporting BCBT for child anxiety and received positive feedback from both therapists and youth patients. Patients rated the app as highly usable (mean=1.7 on a 1-7 scale, with 1="easy"). Patients completed 5.36 skills coach entries per session (standard deviation=1.95) and took an average of 3.14 min (standard deviation=0.98 min) to complete the entries. Conclusions: A smartphone app is feasible within CBT for child anxiety. Users found SmartCAT both acceptable and easy to use. Integrating an m-health platform within BCBT for anxious children may facilitate involvement in treatment and dissemination of effective procedures.

57. **Relationships Among Depressive Symptoms, Benefit-Finding, Optimism, and Positive Affect in Multiple Sclerosis Patients After Psychotherapy for Depression**
Objective: While many patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) experience psychological problems, such as **depress**ion, benefit-finding is commonly reported. Using the Broaden-and-Build Model of positive emotions (Fredrickson, 2001) and the Expectancy-Value Model of optimism (Carver & Scheier, 1998) as two related, yet, distinct conceptual frameworks, this study examined positive affect and optimism as mediators of the relationship between impro**ved dep**ression and enhanced benefit-finding. Design: MS patients (N = 127), who participated in a larger, randomized clinical trial comparing two types of telephone psychother**apy for** depression, were assessed at baseline, midtherapy (8 weeks), end of therapy (16 weeks), and 6- and 12-month posttherapy. Main **Outcom****e Measu**res: Depression was measured with a telephone administered version of the Hamilton R**ating S**cale for Depression; Positive Affect was measured with the Positive Affect Subscale from the Positive and Negative Affect Scale; Optimism was measured with the Life Orientation Test-Revised; Benefit-Finding was measured with the revised version of the Stress-Related Growth Scale. Results: Data were analyzed with multilevel random-effects models, **control**ling for time since MS diagnosis and type of **treatme**nt. Improved depression was associated with increased benefit-finding over time. The relati**onship **between improved depression and benefit-finding was significantly mediated by both increased optimism and increased positive affect. Conclusion: Findings provide support to both theoretical models. Positivity appears to promote benefit-finding in MS.  2008 American Psychological Association. eid: 2-s2.0-43049091568
58. **An internet-based self-help treatment for fear of public speaking: A controlled trial**
This study offers data about the efficacy of "Talk to Me," an Internet-based telepsychology program for the treatment of fear of public speaking that includes the most active components in **cognit**ive-behavior therapy (CBT) for social phobia (exposure an**d **co**gnitive therapi**es). One hundred twenty-seven participants with social phobia were randomly assigned to three experimental conditions: (a) an Internet-based self-administered program; (b) the same program applied by a therapist; (c) a waiting-list **control** group. Results showed that both treatment conditions were equally **efficaci**ous. In addition, Talk to Me and the same treatment applied by a therapist were m**ore effi**cacious than the waiting-list condition. Treatment gains were maintained at 1-year follow-up. The results from this study support the utility of Internet-delivered CBT programs in order to reach a higher number of people who could benefit from CBT. Internet-delivered CBT programs could also play a valuable role in the dissemination of CBT.  2010, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-77955887970
59. **Improving Adherence and Clinical Outcomes in Self-Guided Internet Treatment for Anxiety and Depression: Randomised Controlled Trial**
Background:**Depress**ion and anxiety are common, disabling and chronic. Self-guided internet-delivered treatments are popular, but few people complete them. New strategies are required to realise their potential.Aims:To evaluate the effect of automated emails on the effectiveness, safety, and acceptability of a new automated transdiagnostic self-guided internet-delivered treatment, the Wellbeing Course, for people w**ith dep**ression and anxiety.Method:A randomised **control**led trial was conducted through the website: www.ecentreclinic.org. Two hundred and fifty seven people with elevated symptoms were randomly allocated to the 8 week course either with or without automated emails, or to a waitl**ist con**trol group. Primary **outcom**e measures were the Patient Health Questionnaire 9-Item (PHQ-9) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item (GAD-7).Results:Participants in the treatment groups had lower PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores at post-treatme**nt than** controls. Automated emails increased rates of course completion (58% vs. 35%), and impro**ved ou**tcomes in a subsample with elevated symptoms.Conclusions:The new self-guided course was beneficial, and automated emails faci**litate**d outcomes.

60. **Patients' depression treatment preferences and initiation, adherence, and outcome: A randomized primary care study**
Objective: The authors examined the association of treatment preferences with treatment initiation, adherence, and clinical **outcom**e among nonsenior adult and senior primary care patients with **depress**ion. Methods: Sixty primary care participants meeting DSM-IV criteria for ma**jor dep**ression were randomly assigned to receive treatment congruent or incongruent with their primary stated preference. Participants received either 20 weeks of escitalopram, with monitoring by a care manager, or 12 weekly sessions of interpersonal psychotherapy followed by two monthly booster sessions. Adherence to treatm**ent and** depression severity were reassessed at weeks 4, 8, 12, and 24. Results: Participants expressed stronger preferences for psychotherapy t**han for** antidepressant medication. Preference strength was a more sensitive measure** of ou**tcome than was congruence versus incongruence of preference with the assigned treatment. Across age groups, preference strength was significantly associated with treatment initiation and 12-week adherence ra**te but **not with depression severity or remission. Conclusions: A continuous measure of preference strength may be a more useful measure in clinical practice than preferences per se. Future research should focus on whether and how greater facilitation of the treatment decision-making process between patient and clinician influences c**linica**l outcome. eid: 2-s2.0-61749099487
61. **A randomized trial of telemedicine-based collaborative care for depression**
BACKGROUND: Evidence-based practices designed for large urban clinics are not necessarily portable into smaller isolated clinics. Implementing practice-based collaborative care for **depress**ion in smaller primary care clinics presents unique challenges because it is often not feasible to employ on-site psychiatrists. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the Telemedicine Enhanced **Antidep**ressant Management (TEAM) study was to evaluate a telemedicine-based collaborative care model adapted for small clinics without on-site psychiatrists. DESIGN: Matched sites were randomized to the intervention or usual care. PARTICIPANTS: Small VA Community-based outpatient clinics with no on-site psychiatrists, but access to telepsychiatrists. In 2003-2004, 395 primary care patients wi**th PHQ9** depression severity scores 12 were enrolled, and followed for 12 months. Patients with serious mental illness and current substance dependence were excluded. MEASURES: Medication adherence, treatment response, remission, health status, health-related quality of life, and treatment satisfaction. RESULTS: The sample comprised mostly elderly, white, males with substantial physical and behavioral health comorbidity. At baseline, subjects h**ad mode**rate depression severity (Hopkins Symptom Checklist, SCL-20 = **1.8), 3**.7 prior depression episodes, and 67%** had re**ceived prior depression treatment. Multivariate analyses indicated that intervention patients were more likely to be adherent at both 6 (odds ratio [OR] = 2.1, p = .04) and 12 months (OR = 2.7, p = .01). Intervention patients were more likely to respond by 6 months (OR = 2.0, p = .02), and remit by 12 months (OR = 2.4, p = .02). Intervention patients reported larger gains in mental health status and health-related quality of life, and reported higher satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: Collaborative care can be successfully adapted for primary care clinics without on-site psychiatrists using telemedicine technologies.  2007 Society of General Internal Medicine. eid: 2-s2.0-34447124407
62. **Treatment outcomes in depression: Comparison of remote treatment through telepsychiatry to in-person treatment**
Objective: Telepsychiatry is an increasingly common method of providing psychiatric care, but randomized trials of telepsychiatric treatment compared to in-person treatment have not been done. The primary objective of this study was to compare **treatment **outcom****es of patients with **depress**ive disorders treated remotely by means of telepsychiatry** to ou**tcomes** of dep**ressed patients treated in person. Secondary objectives were to determine if patients' rates of adherence to and satisfaction with treatment were as high with telepsychiatric as with in-person treatment and to compare costs of telepsychiatric treatment to costs of in-person treatment. Method: In this randomized, **control**led tri**al, 119** depressed veterans referred for outpatient treatment were randomly assigned to either remote treatment by means of telepsychiatry or in-person treatment. Psychiatric treatment lasted 6 months and consisted of psychotropic medication, psychoeducation, and brief supportive counseling. Patien**ts' treatment ou**tcomes, satisfaction, and adherence and the costs of treatment were compared between the two conditions. Result**s: Hami**lton Depression Rating** Scale **and Beck Depression Inventory scores improved over the treatment period and did not differ between treatment groups. The two groups were equally adherent to appointments and medication treatment. No between-group differences in dropout rates or patients' ratings of satisfaction with treatment were found. Telepsychiatry was more expensive per treatment session, but this difference disappeared if the costs of psychiatrists' travel to remote clinics more than 22 miles away from the medical center were considered. Telepsychiatry did not increase the overall health care resource consumption of the patients during the study period. Conclusions: **Remote **treatment of depression by means of telepsychiatry and** in-per**son treatment of depression have com**parabl**e outcomes and equivalent levels of patient adherence, patient satisfaction, and health care cost. eid: 2-s2.0-3342991837
63. **Internet treatment for depression: A randomized controlled trial comparing clinician vs. technician assistance**
Background: Internet-based **cognit**ive behavioural therapy (iCBT) for **depress**ion is effective when guided by a clinician, less so if unguided. Question: Would guidance from a technician be as effective as guidance from a clinician? Method: Randomized **control**led non-inferiority trial comparing three groups: Clinician-assisted vs. technician-assisted vs. delayed treatment. Community-based volunteers applied to the VirtualClinic (www.virtualclinic.org.au) research program, and 141 participants with ma**jor dep**ressive disorder were randomized. Participants in the clinician- and technician-assisted groups received access to an iCBT prog**ram for** depression comprising 6 online lessons, weekly homework assignments, and weekly supportive contact over a treatment period of 8 weeks. Participants in the clinician-assisted group also received access to a moderated online discussion forum. The main **outcom**e measures we**re the **Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 Item (PHQ-9). Completion rates were high, and at post-treatment, both treatment groups reduced scores on the BDI-II (p<0.001) and PHQ-9 (p<0.001) compared to the delayed treatment group but did not differ from each other. Within group effect sizes on the BDI-II were 1.27 and 1.20 for the clinician- and technician-assisted groups respectively, and on the PHQ-9, were 1.54 and 1.60 respectively. At 4-month follow-up participants in the technician group had made further improvements and had significantly lower scores on the PHQ-9 than those in the clinician group. A total of approximately 60 minutes of clinician or technician time was required per participant during the 8-week treatment program. Conclusions: Both clinician- and technician-assisted treatment resulted in large effect sizes and clinically significant improvements comparable to those associated with face-to-face treatment, while a delayed treatm**ent con**trol group did not improve. These results provide support for large scale trials to determine the clinical effectiveness and acceptability of technician-assisted iC**BT prog**rams for depression. This form of treatment has potential to increase the capacity of existing mental health services.

64. **Stepping up: Predictors of stepping within an icbt stepped-care intervention for depression**
Internet-based **cognit**ive behavioral therapy (iCBT) may overcome barriers to mental health care and has proven **efficaci**ous. However, this approach currently exists outside the existing mental health care delivery system. Stepped care is a proposed framework for integrating digital mental health (DMH) into health systems by initiating iCBT and stepping up care to a more intensive intervention should iCBT prove ineffective. This study explores pre-treatment factors associated with reaching stepping criteria among patients receiving iCBT. This exploratory analysis of a stepped care arm of a larger randomized trial examined participants who were stepped to a more intensive intervention if they did not respond to iCBT. The association of pre-treatment factors on stepping were examined using KruskalWallis and Chi-square tests. One-fifth of the 151 participants met criteria for stepping within the 20-week treatment period. Only pre-treatment **depress**ion severity and treatment preference were associated with increased likelihood of stepping (p = 0.049 and 0.048, respectively). The low number of individuals who stepped provides support for iCBT as an effective, low intensity treatment **for dep**ression. The modest association of pre-tr**eatment** depression and preference to not receive iCBT may be useful in identifying patients who are less likely to respond.  2019 by the authors.

65. **Findings from a trial of the smartphone and online usage-based evaluation for depression (SOLVD) application: What do apps really tell us about patients with depression? concordance between app-generated data and standard psychiatric questionnaires for depression and anxiety**
Objective: **Depress**ion imposes a notable societal burden, with limited treatment success despite multiple available psychotherapy and medications choices. Potential reasons may include the heterogeneity** of dep**ression diagnoses and the presence of comorbid anxiety symptoms. Despite technological advances and the introduction of many mobile phone applications (apps) claiming to **relieve** depression,major gaps in knowledge still exist regarding what apps truly measure and how they correlate with psychometric questionnaires. The goal of this study was to evaluate whether mobile daily mood self-ratings may be useful in monitoring and **classif**ying depression symptoms **in a cl**inically depressed population compared with standard psychometric instruments including the Patient Health Questionaire-9 (PHQ-9), the Hamilt**on Rati**ng Scale for Depression (HAM-D), and the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A). Method: For this study,** 22 pat**ients with major depressive disorder with or without comorbid anxiety disorder were **recruit**ed. The diagnosis of depression was confirmed through the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). Over an 8-week period, daily moods were selfreported through the Smartphone and On**Line Us**age-based eValuation for Depression (SOLVD) application, a custom-designed application that was downlo**aded on**to patients' mobile devices. Depression and anxiety symptoms were also measured biweekly using the HAM-D, HAM-A, and PHQ-9. Results: Significant correlations were observed among self-evaluated mood, daily steps taken, SMS (text) frequency, average call duration, and biweekly psychometric scores (|r| > 0.5, P <0.05). The correlation coefficients were** higher** in individuals with more severe depressive symptoms. Conclusions: Although this study, given its limited sample size, was exploratory in nature, it helps fill a significant gap in our knowledge of the concordance between ratings obtained on the Ham-D, Ham-A, and the PHQ-9 psychometric instruments and data obtained via a smartphone app. These questionnaires represent goldstandard, commonly used psychiatric research/ clinical instruments, and, thus, this information can serve **as a fo**undation for digital phenotyping for depression and pave the way for interventional studies using smartphone applications.

66. **Evaluating the use of a computerized CBT program for outpatients on a waitlist in a university CBT unit**
Objectives and Design: The goal of this pilot randomized **control**led trial was to determine whether a computerized **cognit**ive-behavioral therapy (cCBT) program for **depress**ion and anxiety could reduce symptoms in outpatients on a waitlist for face-to-face CBT for a variety of mental health complaints. Methods: Sixty-seven outpatients referred for CBT for disparate problems (eg, anxie**ty, dep**ression, obsessions or compulsions) were randomized to 1 of 2 conditions: (1) the cCBT program "Good Days Ahead," which included weekly guidance and support, or (2**) a con**trol condition where patients were referred to a freely available online CBT workbook. Measures of psychological distress were administered at the start of study and at the end of the waiting period, when participants were formally diagnosed and assessed for face-to-face therapy. Results: For the most part, mixed-design analyses of variances revealed no statistically significant changes in symptom measures over time. Nonsignificant interactions and modest effect sizes between groups across time suggest that the cCBT group did not do better t**han the** control group. The majority of cCBT participants reported that the program was "very" or "extremely useful," while only a por**tion of** the control group felt the same about the workbook. There were notable differences in the completion rates of the 2 groups in favor of the cCBT program. Conclusions: Offering a general cCBT program to waiting list patients may not confer an advantage over referring them to an online workbook, at least in terms of symptom reduction. Results could be partly explained by difficulties translating knowledge into practice, especially if participants' main problem was not directly addressed by the intervention.

2. **An Evaluation of the Use of Interactive Television in an Acute Psychiatric Service**
This study reports the results of the use of a low-cost videoconferencing **system** (LCVC) for communication in an **acut**e psychiatric service. Qualitative research methodology was used to examine the use of the LCVC in interactions between psychiatrists, patients and nursing **staff**, including information on refusals. One hundred and five clinical interactions were studied over four months. The LCVC proved technically reliable and compatible with the performance of a wide range of clinical tasks. However, the results suggest the need for better understanding of the nature and origins of the attitudes that users bring to the use of such communications technology. A framework is presented for the classification of user responses in terms of preexisting attitudes of the users, technological limitations of **the sy**stem and the mental state of the users. The study demonstrated the potential for interactive **televis**ion to **support** many of the communication tasks necessary in a dispersed psychiatric service and for telepsychiatry to become a major method of service **provis**ion.  1995, SAGE Publications.

4. **Telepsychiatry: Psychiatric consultation through two-way television. A controlled study**
Telepsychiatry (consultation carried out through 2-way interactive **televis**ion) has been the object of a number of trials in the past twenty years, but to our knowledge there is no previous control study which compares CCTV and face-to-face intreviews. Various aspects of the interviews carried out on CCTV were rated on a 5-point scale in questionnaires filled out by: patients; consultees and; consultants. No significant difference was elicited with control interviews in respect to patients' diagnosis, age and sex. CCTV interview ratings by consultee and consultant were rated only slightly below those of the control group. Such findings should encourage a broader application of interactive CCTV, particularly as a complement to live consultations in distant areas. eid: 2-s2.0-0022618461

Background: Using digital technology to deliver mental health care can possibly serve as a viable adjunct or alternative to mainstream services in lessening the mental health gap in a large number of resource deficient and LAMI countries. Conventional models of telepsychiatric services available so far, however, have been inadequate and ineffective, as these address only a small component of care, and rely on engagement of specialists who are grossly insufficient in numbers. Aim: To describe an innovative digital model of mental health care, enabling and empowering the non-specialists to deliver **high** quality mental health care in **remot**e areas. Methods: The model is powered by an online, fully automated clinical decision **support** **system** (CDSS), with interlinked modules for diagnosis, management and follow-up, usable by non-specialists after **brief** training and minimal supervision by psychiatrist, to deliver mental health care** at r**emote sites. Results: The CDSS has been found to** be **highly **reliabl**e, feasible, with sufficient sensitivity and specificity. This paper describes the model and initial experience with the digital mental health c**are sy**stem deployed in three geographically diffic**ult a**nd remote areas in northern hill states in India. The** onlin**e system was found to be reasonably comprehensi**ve, b**rief, feasible, user-friendl**y, w**ith high levels of patient satisfaction. 2594 patients assessed a**t the** three remote sites and the nodal center represented varied diagnoses. Conclusions: The digital model described here has the potential to serve as an effective alternative or adjunct for delivering compre**hens**ive and high quality mental health care in LAMI countries like India in the primary and secondary care settings.  2019 Indian Journal of Psychiatry. eid: 2-s2.0-85059851863

As a pioneer of training in the field of psychology, the Veterans Affairs (VA) HealthCare **System** serves as a leader in the training in and provision of Telemental Health (TMH) services in the United States. To meet goals toward continued expansion of these services, the VA TMH training program includes both web-based didactic courses and a skills competency test at a basic level with supervision and consultation in TMH for more advanced training and is available to staff psychologists and psychologist trainees. Despite these efforts, barriers for training in and implementation of TMH occur at the provid**er, sy**stem, and patient level. At the national level, the VA is actively working to resolve these barriers and we share site-specific examples implemented by the VA Puget Sound Heal**th Car**e System promoting access through TMH team to further address barriers to training and implementation.  2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-85085358844

Background & objectives: A knowledge-based, logically-linked online telepsychiatric decision **support** **system** for diagnosis and treatment of mental disorders was developed and validated. We evaluated diagnostic accuracy and reliability of the application at **remot**e sites when used by non-psychiatrists who underwent a **brief** training in its use through video-conferencing. Methods: The study was conducted at a nodal telepsychiatry centre, and three geographica**lly r**emote peripheral centres. The diagnostic tool of application had a screening followed by detailed criteria-wise diagnostic modules for 18 psychiatric disorders. A total of 100 consecutive consenting adult outpatients at**tendi**ng remote telepsychiatry centres were included. To assess inter-**rate**r reliability, patients were **interview**ed **face to fac**e by non-spe**ciali**sts at remote sites using the application (act**ive inter**viewer) and simultaneously on online application via video-conferencing by a passive assessor at nodal centre. **Another i**nterviewer at the nodal cen**tre **rated the patient using Mini-International Neuro**psychiatr**ic Interview (MINI) for diagnostic validation. Results: Screening sub-module had **high** sensitivity (80-100%), low positive predictive values (PPV) (0.10-0.71) **but **high negative predictive value (NPV) (0.97-1) for most disorders. For the diagnostic sub-modules, Cohens kappa was >0.4 for all disorders, with kappa of 0.7-1.0 for most disorders. PPV and N**PV w**ere high for most disorders**. In**ter-rater **agreement** analysis revealed kappa >0.6 for all disorders. Interpretation & conclusions: Diagnostic tool showed acceptable to good validity and reliability when used by non**-spec**ialists at remote sites.

3. **A novel screening and diagnostic tool for child and adolescent psychiatric disorders for telepsychiatry**
Background: A diagnostic tool designed as part of a telepsychiatry application for diagnosis and management of child and adolescent psychiatric disorders in India was developed considering the paucity of trained child psychiatrists and mental health professionals in India. Materials and Methods: The diagnostic tool consisted of screening and 10 th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10) criteria-based diagnostic algorithms for 18 psychiatric disorders seen in childhood and adolescence. Accuracy of diagnoses and feasibility of use of the tool was examined by comparing it with detailed semi-structured clinical evaluations by a qualified psychiatrist with 50 psychiatric patients (children and adolescents). Statistical Analysis: Descriptive analyses and paired t-tests were conducted to compare the mean number of diagnosis gene**rate**d by the two **interview**s. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values were computed for the screening and the diagnostic sub-modules of the tool, compared to the clinical diagnoses. Kappa coefficients were computed to assess **agreement** between the diagnoses **gene**rated by the diagnostic sub-module and the clinical diagnoses. Results: The screening sub-module had **high** sensitivi**ty, **high specificity and negative predictive values for all disorders. For the diagnostic sub-module, there **was **moderate (kappa-0.4-0.6) to substant**ial agree**ment (kappa &gt; 0.6) for all the disorders, (except psychos**is) **and high sensitivity (barring a few disorders) and specificity for almost all the disorders. Positive predictive values were found to be ac**cept**able to high for most disorders, wi**th c**onsistently high negative predictive values. Conclusion: The new tool was found to be comprehensive, reasonably short and feasible. Results showed acceptable level of accuracy in di**agno**sis generated by the tool. eid: 2-s2.0-84994807407
4. **Usability and reliability of a remotely administered adult autism assessment, the autism diagnostic observation schedule (ADOS) module 4**
Introduction: The Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) Module 4 is an autism assessment designed for verbally fluent adolescents and adults. Because of a shortage of available clinical expertise, it can be difficult for adults to receive a proper autism spectrum disorder (ASD) diagnostic assessment. A potential option to address this shortage is **remot**e assessment. The objective of this study was to examine the feasibility, usability, and reliability of administering the ADOS Modul**e 4 r**emotely using the Versatile and Integ**rate**d **System** for Telerehabilitation (VISYTER). Materials and Methods: VISYTER consists of computer stations at the client site and clinician site for video communication and a Web portal for managing and coordinating the assessment process. Twenty-three adults with an ASD diagnosis participated in a within-subject crossover design study in which** both** a remote ADOS and a face-to-face ADOS were administered. After com**pleti**ng the remote ADOS, participants completed a satisfaction survey. Results: Participant satisf**actio**n with the remote ADOS deliv**ery sy**stem was **high**. The kappa value was greater than 0.61 on 21 of 31 ADOS items. There was substantial **agreement** on ADOS classification (i.e., diagnosis) between assessments delivered face-to-face versus as**sessm**ents delivered remotely (interclass coefficient=0.92). **Non-agree**ment may have been due to outside factors or practice effect despite a washout period. Conclusions: The results of this study dem**onst**rate that an autism assessment designed to be delivered **face to fac****e c**an be administered remotely using **an i**ntegrated We**b-base**d system w**ith **high levels of usability and reliability.

5. **Application of telepsychiatry: A preliminary study**
Telemedicine is the provision of professional medical services from sites removed from the patient. This study was conducted in order to assess the reliability of psychiatric evaluations via video-consultation. The inter- **rate**r reliability was determined for each **interview**ing condition by employing the reliability-testing paradigm in which the **brief** psychiatric rating scale (BPRS) and the interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) are used. The int**er- **rater reliability scores between face-to-f**ace inter**vi**ews and i**nterviews conducted by video at two different levels of image qualities were compared by the authors. Reliability was found to be in perfect **agreement** in **each of t**he interviewing conditions. This study verifies that telepsychiatry is a **reliabl**e method of assessing patient conditions. It may be used to provide much needed mental health-care services to patients whose access to them is restricted. eid: 2-s2.0-0034014241
6. **The reliability of telepsychiatry for a neuropsychiatric assessment**
Objective: To determine whether or not the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS), an examination that relies on visual judgments, can be **reliabl**y measured via video conferencing equipment. Methods: AIMS scores were assessed by two independent **rate**rs in face-to-face contact with the subject and **two **raters observing **remot**ely via audio-visual transmission. We determine**d in**ter-rater reliabilities using the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC). We assessed if the condi**tion** of the rater influenced the ICC. We distinguished betw**een **whether the rater was physically in the room with the subject or was connected via video. We then statistically compared the differences between these conditions. Results: There were no significant statistical diff**eren**ces between the raters, which could be attributed to the condition while assessing involuntary movements using the AIMS instrument. Regardless of whether this assessment was conducted by direct observation or via video conferencing equipment, the results w**ere rel**iable to the same degree. Conc**lusion:** Reliable neuropsychiatric assessments can be conducted using telemedicine even if primarily visual input is evaluated.  Copyright 2011, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-79955081873
7. **An integrated telehealth system for remote administration of an adult autism assessment**
We developed a telehealth **system** to administer an autism assessment **remot**ely. **The r**emote assessm**ent sy**stem integ**rate**s videoconferencing, stimuli presentation, recording, image and video presentation, and electronic assessment scoring into an intuitive software platform. This is an advancement over existing technologies used in telemental health, which currently require several devices. The number of children, adolescents, and adults with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) has increased dramatically over the past 20 years and is expected to continue to increase in coming years. In general, there are not many clinicians trained in either the diagnosis or treatment of adults with ASD. Given the number of adults with autism in **need,** a remote ass**essmen**t system can potentially provide a solution to the lack of trained clinicians. The goal is **to ma**ke the remote** asses**sment system as close to face-to-face assessment as possible, yet versatile enough to **support** deployment in underserved areas. The primary challenge to achieving this goal is that the assessment requires social interaction that appears natural and fl**uid****, so t**he remote system needs to be able** to sup**port fluid natural interaction. For this study we developed compon**ents to** support this type of interaction and i**nteg**rated thes**e comp**onents into a system** capabl**e of supporting the entire autistic assessment protocol. **We the**n implemented t**he sys**tem and evaluated the system on real patients. The results suggest that we have ac**hieved** our goal in developing a system with **high**-quality interaction that is easy to use.

8. **Development of a novel diagnostic system for a telepsychiatric application: A pilot validation study**
Background: A net-based, decision **support** **system** for diagnostic assessment and management of psychiatric disorders, developed as part of a telepsychiatry service, which aims to deliver mental health care to underserved population of **remot**e areas in India is described. This paper presents the development and preliminary results of diagnostic validation of the application, intended for use among adult patients. The bilingual (English and Hindi) diagnostic tool consists of a core diagnostic section comprising a screening sub-module and criteria-based diagnostic sub-modules for 18 adult psychiatric disorders, and additional sections covering background information. The diagnostic tool of the application was examined among 100 consecutive consenting adult outpatients, by comparing it with detailed semi-structured clinical assessments led by a consultant psychiatrist, on accuracy of diagnoses gene**rate**d, and examining the feasibility of its use. Results: The screening sub-module had **high** sensitivity **and **high specificity, low positive predictive valu**es, **but high negative predictive values for most disorders. For the diagnostic sub-modules, there was **mode**rate (kappa = 0.4-0.6), to substantial **agreement** (kappa > 0.6) between diagno**ses **generated by the tool and consultants' diagnoses, for all the disorders except dysthymia. Sens**itiv**ity was high barring a few disorders. **Spec**ificity was high for all the disorders, positive predictive values** wer**e acceptable to high for most disorders, and negative predictive v**alue**s were consistently high.** Com**pletion rate was 100%; average time taken was five minutes for screening alone, and 30 minutes for complete assessment with screening and criteria-based evaluation. A majority of the patients, their relatives, and **interview**ers were satisfied with **the inter**view. Conclusions: The preliminary results indicated that despite some limitations, the new diagnos**tic sy**stem was reasonably comprehensive, time-efficient and feasible, with an acceptable level of diagnostic accuracy. Hence, it appeared to be suitable for use as a telepsychiatric application.  2014 Malhotra et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd. eid: 2-s2.0-84906923585
9. **The Intelligent e-Therapy system: A new paradigm for telepsychology and cybertherapy**
One of the main drawbacks of computer-assisted psychology tools developed up to now is related to the real time customisation and adaptation of the content to each patient depending on his/her activity. In this paper we propose a new approach for mental e-health treatments named Intelligent e-Therapy (eIT) with capabilities for ambient intelligence and ubiquitous computing. From a technical point of view, an eIT **system** is based on four fundamental axes: ambient intelligence for capturing physiological, psychological and contextual information of the patient; persuasive computing for changing/reinforcing behaviours; ubiquitous computing for using **the sy**stem at any place, and at any time; and multiple technological platforms **support**.  2009 Taylor & Francis. eid: 2-s2.0-70449497700
10. **Transcultural psychiatry made simple - Asynchronous telepsychiatry as an approach to providing culturally relevant care**
Objective: To examine the feasibility and diagnostic reliability of asynchronous telepsychiatry (ATP) consultations in Spanish and ATP consultation with Spanish-to-English translation. Subjects and Methods: Twenty-four **interview**s of Spanish-speaking patients were videorecorded by a bilingual clinician who also collected patient history data and gave the Structured Clini**cal Inter**view for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders (SCID-I) to each patient. The ATP data (video** of the i**nterview and patient history) were forwarded for psychiatric consultation and a diagnostic assessment by the investigators. The ATP data were then examined sepa**rate**ly by two Spanish-speaking psychiatrists, before being translated into English and then re-examined by two English-speaking psychiatrists. **Agreement** between the expert diagnoses of the investigators and the diagnoses from the Spanish consultations, the Spanish-to-English translated consultations, and the SCID-I results was assessed using kappa statistics. Results: We found acceptable levels** of agree**ment for major diagnostic groupings among the Spanish- and English-speaking psychiatrists. Kappa values for dia**gnostic a**greement between the expert and the translated consultations, the original language consultations, and the SCID-I were at least 0.52 **(percenta**ge agreement, 79%) and **high**er. Conclusions: ATP consultations in Spanish, and those translated from Spanish to English, are feasible, and broad diagnostic reliability was achieved. The ATP process allows for rapid language translation. This approach could be useful across national boundaries and in numerous ethnic groups. Cross-language ATP may also offer significant benefits over the use of real-time interpreting services and has the potential to improve the quality of care by allowing for the addition of culturally relevant information.

11. **Reliability of telepsychiatry assessments: Subjective versus observational ratings**
Geriatric patients in underserved areas could benefit from the use of telecommunications to expand access to mental health services. It is important to determine the clinical limitations of using videoconferencing for psychiatric assessments, particularly in the elderly. The goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that videoconferencing ratings based on visual observations of behavior would be less **reliabl**e than ratings based on patients' verbal reports of symptoms. Videoconferencing assessments of 30 geriatric patients using low-bandwidth (ISDN) equipment were compared to gold standard face-to-face assessments. The **Brief** Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) was dichotomized into subjective items based on patients' verbal reports and observational items based on visual ratings of behavior. Reliability of the BPRS subjective items was consistently **high**er than for the observational items. Future studies should emphasize the accuracy of telemedicine ratings that require visual observation of behavior, which is crucial to clinical assessment of psychogeriatric conditions. eid: 2-s2.0-0034970335
12. **Telepsychiatry: Assessment of televideo psychiatric interview reliability with present- and next-generation internet infrastructures**
Objective: We assessed the reliability of **remot**e video psychiatric **interview**s conducted via the internet using narrow and broad bandwidths. Method: Televideo psychiat**ric inter**views conducted with 42 in-patients with chronic schizophrenia using two bandwidths (narrow, 128 kilobits/s; broad, 2 megabits/s) were assessed in terms of **agreement** with face-**to-face i**nterviews in a test-retest fashion. As a contr**ol, agree**ment was assessed between f**ace-to-fa**ce interviews. Psychiatric symptoms were **rate**d using the Oxford version of the **Brief** Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPR**S), and a**g**reement b**etween interviews was estimated as the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Results: The ICC was significantly lower in the narrow bandwidth than in the broad bandwidth and the control for both positive symptoms score and total score. Conclusion: While reliability of te**levideo p**sychiatric interviews is insufficient using the present narrow-band internet infrastructure, the next generation of infrastructure (broad-band) may permit ****reliabl****e diagnostic interviews. eid: 2-s2.0-0034893102
13. **Diagnostic reliability of telepsychiatry in American Indian veterans**
Objective: This study examined the reliability of the Structured Clinical **Interview** for DSM-III-R (SCID) in the administration of psychiatric assessments by real-time videoconferencing compared to face-to-face assessment within a rural American Indian community. Method: The SCID was administered to 53 male American Indian veterans who were randomly assigned over two sepa**rate** occasions by differ**ent inter**viewers to face-to-face and real-time interactive videoconferencing within 2 weeks. Comparisons were made with prevalences, the McNemar test, and the kappa statistic. Results: With the exception of past-year substance dependence and abuse/dependence combined, there were no significant differences between face-to-face and videoconference administration. The majority of kappas calculated (76%) indicated a good or fair level of **agreement**. Externalizing disorders tended to elicit greater concordance than internalizing disorders. Conclusions: Overall, SCID assessment by live interactive videoconferencing did not differ significantly from face-to-face assessment in this population. Videoconferencing is a viable vehicle for clinical and research purposes. eid: 2-s2.0-33846502249

The **Child**rens Attention-deficit **Hyperact**ivity Disorder (**ADHD**) Telemental Health Treatment Study (**CATT**S) tested the hypotheses t**hat c**hildren and **caregiv**ers who received guideline-based treatment delivered through a hybrid telehealth service delivery model would experience greater improvements in outcom**es th**an children **and car**egivers receiving treatment via a comparison delivery model. Here, we **present** caregiver outcomes. 88 primary care providers (PCPs) in seven geographically **underserv**ed communities r**eferr**ed 223 children (ages 5.5  12.9years) to the randomized controlled trial**. Ove**r 22weeks, children randomized to **the **CATTS service delivery model received six sessions of telepsychiatry and six **session**s of caregiver **behavior** management training provided in **person** by community therapists who were trained and s**uperv**ised remotely. Children randomized to the comparison Augmented Primary Care (APC) service model received management in primary care augmented by a single telepsychiatr**y consu**ltation. Caregiver outcomes included changes in distress, as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Parenting **Stress **Index (PSI), Caregiver Strain Questionnaire (CSQ) and Family E**mpowerm**ent Scale (FES). Caregivers completed five assessments. Multilevel mixed effects regression modeling tested for differences between the two** servic**e delivery models in caregiver outcomes from b**aseline** to 25weeks.

1. **Interventions Developed for Psychiatric and Behavioral Treatment in the Childrens ADHD Telemental Health Treatment Study**
Telemental health (TMH) is one approach to rectifying geographic disparity in access to evidence-based mental health treatment for **ADHD**. We describe a brief (6-session) intervention for the TMH delivery of medication treatment with psychoeducation and **Caregiv**er **Behavior**al Training to families of **child**ren w**ith **ADHD from **underserv**ed communities. Information on family engagement, satisfaction, and fidelity to intervention protocols are presented. Overall, both parts of the intervention were well-received by families who engaged with the treatment, who learned information and skills, and who indicated very high levels of satisfaction with treatment, even though it was relatively brief in nature. Mean ratings of satisfaction for the c**ombi**ned ADHD treatment was 38 (range=2740) out of a possible total score of 40 on the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire. Both telepsychiatrists and therapists were highly faithful to the intervention protocols, as demonstrated by their independently-rated fidelity. Telepsychiatrists adhered to the intervention protocol with 91.69.5% reliability, and therapists adhered to their intervention protocol with 94.3% (SD: 9.7%) reliability This brief stabilization model of intervention is particularly relevant to working with a remote population where treatment resources are scarce. This study demonstrates that it is possible to provide direct psychiatric **and beha**vioral services through telepsychiatry and to train and supervise therapists remotely.  2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York. eid: 2-s2.0-84939889835
2. **Methodology for conducting the Children's Attention-deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Telemental Health Treatment Study in multiple underserved communities**
Background **Child**ren living in nonmetropolitan communities are **underserv**ed by evidence-based mental health care and are underrepresented in clinical trials. Purpose In this article, we describe lessons learned in conducting **the C**hildrens Attention-Deficit **Hyperact**ivity Disorder (**ADHD**) Telemental Health (TMH) Treatment Study (**CATT**S), a randomized controlled trial testing the effectiveness of TMH in improving outc**omes **of children w**ith **ADHD living** in under**served communiti**es. M**ethods Children were referred by primary care providers (PCPs). The test intervention group received six telepsychiatry sessions with each session followed by an **caregiv**er **behavior** training session delivered in-**person** by a local therapist. A secure website was used to support decision making by the telepsychiatrists and to facilitate real-time collaboration between the telepsychiatrists and community therapists. The control group received a single telepsychiatry consultation. Questionnaires **tapp**ing ADHD symptoms and other outcomes were administered to parents and teachers online through a secure portal f**rom pe**rsonal computers. Results A total of 88 PCPs in seven communities r**eferr**ed the 223 children who participated in the trial. Attrition in treatment sessions and research assessments was very low. Lessons learned TMH proved to be a viable means of providing evidence-based pharmaco**logic**al services to children and training to local therapists. Recruitment was enhanced by offering the control group a telepsychiatry consultation. Sitespecific strategies were needed to meet recruitment targets. Conclusions **The **CATTS trial used methods designed t**o opt**imize inclusion of children living in multiple disper**sed and u**nderserved areas. The study will serve as a model for other research projects aiming at reducing geographic disparities in access to quality mental health care.  2012 The Author(s). eid: 2-s2.0-84889824159

0. **Cognitive assessment of patients with Alzheimer's disease by telemedicine: Pilot study**
Background: Approximately 46.8 million people are living with **dementia** worldwide and their number will grow in the next years. Any potential treatment should be administered as early as possible because it is important to provide an early cognitive assessment and to regularly monitor the mental function of patients. Information and communication technologies can be helpful to reach and follow patients without displacing them, but there may be doubts about the reliability of cognitive tests performed by telemedicine. Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the reliability of the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog) tests administered in hospital by **videoconfer**ence to patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. Methods: The tests were administered to 28 Alzheimer's disease outpatients (8 male, mean age 73.88, SD 7.45 years; 20 female mean age 76.00, SD 5.40 years) recruited and followed in the Alzheimer's Unit of the A Cardarelli National Hospital (Naples, Italy) at **baselin**e and after 6, 12, 18, and 24 months of observation. Patients were evaluated first face-to-face by a psychologist and then, after 2 weeks, by another psychologist **via videoco**nference in hospital. Results: This study showed no differences in the MMSE and ADAS-cog scores when the tests were administered face-to-fac**e or by vid**eoconference, except in patients with more pronounced cognitive deficits (MMSE<17), in which the ass**essment via** videoconference overestimated the cognitive impairment (**face to fac**e, MMSE mean 13.9, SD 4.9 and ADAS-cog me**an 9.0, SD **3.8; videoconference, MMSE mean 42.8, SD 12.5 and ADAS-cog mean 56.9, SD 5.5). Conclus**ions: We fo**und that videoconferencing is a reliable approach to document cognitive stability or decline, and to measure treatment effects in patients with mild to moder**ate deme**ntia. A more extended study is needed to confirm these results.  Anna Carotenuto, Raffaele Rea, Enea Traini, Giovanna Ricci, Angiola Maria Fasanaro, Francesco Amenta. eid: 2-s2.0-85047544251
1. **Program evaluation of a telepsychiatry service for older adults connecting a university-affiliated geriatric center to a rural psychogeriatric outreach service in Northwest Ontario, Canada**
ABSTRACT Background: Weekly telepsychiatry consultations have been provided since 2002 to six communities in Northwest Ontario. Staff from a single community psycho**geriatr**ic outreach service who work within these communities facilitate the referrals. Methods: The program evaluation included (a) a chart review of the last 100 referrals, (b) analysis of patient and staff evaluations, (c) a survey mailed to all physicians in referring communities, and (d) three focus groups of staff working in local community agencies. Results: The mean age at the time of consultation was 76.7 years. Sixty-eight percent of patients were females. The most frequent diagnoses were **dementia** (54%), depression (28%), and mild cognitive impairment (19%). The most frequent medication recommendations were antidepressants or cholinesterase inhibitors. Two hundred ninety-four patient assessments and case consultations were carried out between 2002 and 2009. Post-session evaluation surveys rated the provision of information, whether objectives were met, and overall usefulness of recommendations. The mean scores for these questions on a 5-point scale were between 4.6 and 4.85. Referring physicians were confident and satisfied with the recommendations made for their patients. All planned to continue to use telepsychiatry as a care option for the future. The focus groups added useful information about challenges and potential barriers to utilizing the program. Conclusions: The program was rated as being highly valued across all modalities of evaluation. Members of the referring team believe that access t**o a ger**iatric psychiatrist has broadened the team's knowledge base, its use of assessment tools, and increased their ability to better construct their patients' treatment plans.

2. **ECHO-AGE: An Innovative Model of Geriatric Care for Long-Term Care Residents With Dementia and Behavioral Issues**
Objectives: To design, implement, and assess the pilot phase of an innovative, remote case-based video-consultation program called ECHO-AGE that links experts in the management of behavior disorders in patients with **dementia** to **nurs**ing **home** care providers. Design: Pilot study involving surveying of participating long-term care sites regarding utility of recommendations and resident outcomes. Setting: Eleven long-term care sites in Massachusetts and Maine. Participants: An interprofessional specialty team at a tertiary care center and staff from 11 long-term care sites. Intervention: Long-term care sites presented challenging cases regarding residents w**ith deme**ntia and/or delirium related behavioral issues to specialists via video-conferencing. Methods: **Baselin**e resident characteristics and follow-up data regarding compliance with ECHO-AGE recommendations, resident improvement, hospitalization, and mortality were collected from the long-term care sites. Results: Forty-seven residents, with a mean age of 82years, were presented during the ECHO-AGE pilot period. Eighty-three percent of residents had a his**tory of **dementia and 44% were taking antipsychotic medications. The most common reasons for presentation were agitation, intrusiveness, and paranoia. Behavioral plans were recommended in 72.3% of patients. Suggestions for medication adjustments were also frequent. ECHO-AGE recommendations were completely or partially followed in 88.6% of residents. When recommendations were followed, sites were much more likely to report clinical improvement (74% vs 20%, P<.03). Hospitalization was also less common among residents for whom recommendations were followed. Conclusions: The results suggest that a case-based video-consultation program can be successful in improving the care of **elders w**ith dementia and/or delirium related behavioral issues by linking specialists with long-term care providers.  2014. eid: 2-s2.0-84912534512
3. **Feasibility and effectiveness of telepsychiatry services for Chinese immigrants in a nursing home**
This study investigates the feasibility and effectiveness of providing telepsychiatry services to Chinese immigrants in a **nurs**ing **home**. The psychiatrist interviewed patients face-to-face for the initial consultation, and encouraged them to participate in this study to receive telepsychiatry-based follow-up visits. The feasibility and outcomes of telepsychiatry visits and satisfaction of the subjects, their families, and **the **nurs**ing **home staff were assessed. Nine monolingual Chinese immigrants, 8 women and 1 man, ranging from 54 to 88 years of age, were enrolled. The main reasons for psychiatric consultation were mood and behavioral problems. Eight of the 9 (88.9%) subjects participated in **videoconfer**ence follow-up visits, and 1 subject (11.1%) declined. Among the 8 subjects, 6 were referred for psychiatric intervention, 1 for differential diagnosis, and 1 for suicide assessment. At the end of the study, all 6 subjects referred for intervention had greatly improved; the subjects, their families, **and **the nursing staff were highly satisfied with the telepsychiatry service. It is feasible to provide psychiatry consultations to ethnic immigr**ants** in a **nurs**ing home despite the fact that many of them are unfamiliar with the technology and suffer from **dementia** and psychotic symptoms. Telepsychiatry provides an efficient way for ethni**c el**ders** in **nursing homes to connect with mental health professionals with the appropriate language and cultural background, regardless of location. Telepsychiatry may decrease the disparities in treatment of mental illnesses among ethni**c im**migr**ants** in nursing homes.  2009, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-66149190915
4. **Telepsychiatry consultations to a rural nursing facility: A 2-year experience**
This report describes the operation of a telepsychiatry consultation service provided from an academic medical center to a skilled **nurs**ing facility in a rural setting. Seventy-one consultations via low-cost ISDN **videoconfer**encing equipment were provided over the 2-year period to 40 patients. The average duration of the consultation period was about 3 months. A wide variety of diagnostic conditions were encountered, with the majority being either depression or **dementia**-related behavior problems. Advantages of the program included the ability to respond promptly to rural patients' clinical needs, the flexibility to consult more frequently if clinically indicated, and more efficient use of the consultant's time, as travel time was eliminated. The program is an example of how telepsychiatry can successfully expand access to mental health services to residents of long-term care facilities. eid: 2-s2.0-0034978061
5. **Identifying undiagnosed dementia in residential care veterans: Comparing telemedicine to in-person clinical examination**
Background: **Dementia** is a common but frequently undiagnosed problem in aging. Barriers to early diagnosis include a lack of routine screening **for deme**ntia and a lack of access to specialty consultative services. We conducted a pilot study to see if telemedicine could provide reliable, accurate **geriatr**ic consultative services to evaluate patie**nts for **dementia who were residing at remote sites. Methods: This was a prospective cohort study that compared the diagnostic reliability of telemedicine to an in-person exam**ination **for dementia. Eligible subjects were residents of a Washington State Veterans' **Home**, age 60 years or older, with no pri**or diagn**osis of dementia. Eligible subject**s were s**creened for dementia using the 7-Minute Screen. Veterans who screened positive and consented to participate in the study received an in-person neuropsychiatric evaluation at **baselin**e, and then both telemedicine and in-**person e**xaminations for dementia conducted by experien**ced ger**iatric psychiatrists. The accuracy of the telemedicine diagnosis was estimated by comparing it to the diagnosis from the clinical examination**. Three** geriatric psychiatrists who were blinded to the results of the clinical examination conducted the telemedicine and in-person examinations. We also assessed attitudes of the s**ubjects** and geriatric psychiatrists towards the telemedicine sessions. Results: Eighteen of 85 subjects s**creened **were 'positive' for dementia on the 7 Minute Screen. Of these, 16 consented to participate in the telemedicine study. Twelve of the 16 subjects w**ere subs**equently diagnosed with dementia by the telemedicine examination. The telemedicine diagnoses were in 100% agreement with the diagnoses from the in-person clinical examinations. Moreover, the subjects reported a high degree of satisfaction with the telemedicine experience and that they would like to have further care through telemedicine in **the fut**ure. The geriatric psychiatrists reported technical difficulties with the audio-visual quality of telemedicine in the initial phases of the project that resolved as familiarity with the telemedicine equipment increased. None of these problems had an adverse impact on the diagnostic accuracy of telemedicine. Conclusions: We found that telemedicine was as accurate as an in-person clinical examinati**on in es**tablishing the diagnosis of dementia. In addition, subjects reported a high degree of satisfaction with telemedicine and a willingness to participate in telemedicine clinical care in the future. Given the large increase in the aging population **and the** shortage of geriatric psychiatrists nationally, it appears that telemedicine may be a promising means to exp**and the** availability of geriatric psychiatric consultation to remote areas.

A pilot study on telepsychiatry was conducted in which a **videoconfer**encing link was established between a regional hospital and a care and attention **home**. Using this system, a psycho**geriatr**ic outreach team provided 149 psychiatric assessments to 45 residents of the care and attent**ion **home over 11 mont**hs. Videoco**nferencing was found to be highly feasible. It was acceptable to staff and patients and more cost-effective than on-site visits.

7. **Benefits of a telepsychiatry consultation service for rural nursing home residents**
Psychiatric care for **nurs**ing **home** residents is difficult to obtain, especially in rural areas, and this deficiency may lead to significant morbidity or death. Providing this service by **videoconfer**ence may be a helpful, cost-effective, and acceptable alternative to face-to-face treatment. We analyzed data for 278 telepsychiatry encounters for **106 **nurs**ing **home residents to estimate potential cost and time savings associated with this modality compared to in-person care. A total of 843.5 hours (105.4 8-hour work days) of travel time was saved compared to in-person consultation for each of the 278 encounters if they had occurred separately. If four resident visits were possible for each trip, the time saved would decrease to 26.4 workdays. Travel distance saved was 43,000 miles; 10,750 miles if four visits per trip occurred. More than $3,700 would be spent on gasoline for 278 separate encounters; decreased to $925 for four visits per roundtrip. Personnel cost savings estimates ranged from $33,739 to $67,477. Physician costs associated with additional travel time ranged from $84,347 to $253,040 for 278 encounters, or from $21,087 to $63,260 for four encounters per visit. The telepsychiatry approach was enthusiastically accepted by virtually all residents, family members**, an**d **nurs**ing home personnel, and led to successful patient management. Providing psychiatric care t**o ru****ral **nursing home residents** by videoco**nference is cost effective and appears to be a medically acceptable alternative to face-to-face care. In addition, this approach will** all****ow m**any nursing homes to provide essential care that would not otherwise be available.  2010 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-76349109253
8. **A videophone psychosocial intervention for dementia caregivers**
Background/Objectives: Available services and intervention programs for **dementia** caregivers are often underutilized because of issues such as cost, logistics, lack of knowledge about available services, or insufficient support from others. Information technologies offer the potential of removing these barriers and facilitating the ability of caregivers to access needed support. This project evaluated the feasibility and efficacy of technologybased psychosocial intervention among minority family caregivers** of deme**ntia patients. Design: A feasibility and efficacy trial. Setting: Participants' **home**s in the Greater Miami Community. Participants: One hundred ten (56 Hispanic American and 54 African American) caregivers of patien**ts with **dementia. Intervention: A technologybased multi-component psychosocial intervention was delivered** in-**home and via videophone technology over 5 months. The intervention wasmodeled after the REACH II intervention and targeted known areas of caregiver risk. Measurement: Standardized measures of depression, caregiver burden, social support, and the caregivers' perception of the caregiver's experience were administered at **baselin**e and 5 months postrandomization. Results: Overall, caregivers who received the intervention reported a decrease in burden, an increase in perceived social support and positive perceptions of the caregiving experience. No effect was observed for depression. Most participants indicated that the intervention improved their caregiving skills and found the technology to be easy to use. Conclusions: A technology-based format was feasible for delivering a multi-component intervention to mino**rity fam**ily dementia caregivers. The intervention improved caregiver outcomes for both Hispanic and African American caregivers. The results suggest that technology may help eliminate disparities in access to caregiver intervention programs.  2013 American Association for **Geriatr**ic Psychiatry. eid: 2-s2.0-84888644123
9. **Cognitive intervention for community-dwelling older persons with memory problems: Telemedicine versus face-to-face treatment**
Background: Memory complaints and decline in cognitive function are common in the elederly. Cognitive intervention has been shown to be beneficial in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, few community-based cognitive intervention programs are available in Hong Kong. The aim of this project is to examine and compare the feasibility, acceptability, and clinical outcome of a cognitive intervention program for older patients with mild cognitive impairment and mild **dementia** using telemedicine versus a conventional face-to-face method. Methods: Community-dwelling older subjects with m**ild deme**ntia or mild cognitive impairments were recruited from a community center. A total of 12 sessions of assessment and cognitive intervention were conducted via **videoconfer**encing or by face-to-face method. Assessment included: Cantonese version of Mini Mental State Examination (C-MMSE), Cantonese version of Rivermead Behavioural Memory test (C-RBMT) and Hie**rarchic **Dementia Scale (HDS). Results: Twenty-two clients were recruited. There was significant and comparable cognitive improvement in clients in both treatment arms. **The videoco**nference arm was highly accepted by the clients and the community center. Overall compliance rate of participants was above 95%. Conclusions: Telemedicine was a feasible, effective and acceptable means in providing cognitive assessment and intervention to older persons with mild cognitive deficits. Promoting such a program to other community settings would further enhance the acces**sibility** of dementia service to the community. Copyright  2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. eid: 2-s2.0-15344348363

0. **RCT of a brief phone-based CBT intervention to improve PTSD treatment utilization by returning service members**
Objectives: Many service members do not seek care for mental health and addiction problems, often with serious consequences for them, their families, and their communities. This study tested the effectiveness of a brief, telephone-based, cognitive-behavioral intervention designed to improve treatment engagement among returning service members who screened positive for **posttraumat**ic **stress** disorder (**PTSD**). Methods: Service members who had served in Operation Enduring Freedom or Operation Iraqi Freedom who screened positive **for **PTSD but had not eng**aged** in PTSD treatment were recruited (N=300), randomly assigned to either control or intervention conditions, and administered a baseline interview. Intervention participants received a brief cognitive-behavioral therapy intervention; participants in the control condition had access to usual services. All participants received follow-up phone calls at months 1, 3, and 6 to assess symptoms and service utilization. Results: Participants in both conditions had comparable rates of treatment eng**agem**ent and PTSD symptom reduction over the course of the six-month trial, but receiving the telephonebased intervention accelerated service utilization (treatment engagement and number o**f se**ssions) and PTSD symptom reduction. Conclusions: A one-time brief telephone intervention can engage** ser**vice members in PTSD treatment earlier than conventional methods and can lead to immediate symptom reduction. There were no differences at longer-term follow-up, suggesting the need for additional intervention to build upon initial gains.  2014, American Psychiatric Association.

1. **Posttraumatic stress disorder treatment for operation enduring freedom/operation iraqi freedom combat veterans through a civilian community-based telemedicine network**
Background: Telemedicine holds great potential to improve access to care and to reduce barriers to treatment for military populations with **posttraumat**ic **stress** disorder (**PTSD**). This study sought to integrate the use of telemedicine mental health treatment services by a community healthcare provider to military populations residing in a rural location and to compare the equivalency of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) administered via telemedicine and traditional face-to-face therapy. Subjects and Methods: Study subjects were men or women 18 years of age or older who had served in Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and/or Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and were diagnosed w**ith **PTSD. The 18 study subjects were randomized and provided 10 weekly therapy sessions of CBT. Pre- and post-intervention assessments were conducted using the Clinician Admin**iste**red PTSD Scale (CAPS), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), Life Events Checklist, and SF-36v2 (QualityMetric, Lincoln, RI) Health Survey. Results: The CAPS, HAM-A, and MADRS each demonstrated lower scores, signifying improvement, and 69% of subjects experienced a clinically significant change in the CAPS. Patient satisfaction results indicated greater satisfaction for telemedicine as opposed to traditional face-to-face treatment. Conclusions: Findings reveal a trend expressing the equivalence of telemedicine and face-to-face therapy when treating OEF/OIF ve**tera**ns with PTSD among rural populations by a community provider. It further demonstrates the successful collaboration between a community healthcare provider and the military healthcare system. Copyright  2014, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-84900027015
2. **Relative efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy administered by videoconference for posttraumatic stress disorder: A six-month follow-up**
Until recently, only one study was published on cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) of **posttraumat**ic **stress** disorder (**PTSD**) in individual therapy via videoconference (Germain, Marchand, Bouchard, Drouin, &amp; Guay, 2009); however, it only assessed the posttreatment effect. This study presents the follow-up of Germain et al.'s (2009) study. The main goal was to compare the effectiveness after six months of CBT**for **PTSD either face-to-face (n = 24) or by videoconference (n = 12). Each participant received CBT for 16 to 25 weeks and completed various questionnaires before and after treatment and at a six-month follow-up. The two treatments had equivalent levels of symptom reduction (M**odif**ied PTSD Symptom Scale: 2 &lt; 0.01, p &gt;.05) and proportion of patients with a clinically significant change in symptoms (42% for face-to-face vs. 38% for videoconferencing, p &gt;.05). T**hus,** CBTfor PTSD via videoconference seems to be a viable alternative when adequate face-to-face treatments are less available.

3. **Are Community Studies of Psychological Trauma's Impact Accurate? A Study Among Jews and Palestinians**
We evaluated the accuracy of **posttraumat**ic **stress** disorder (**PTSD**) and major depression (MD) diagnoses using brief assessment instruments conducted by pho**ne. **PTSD and MD were assessed by telephone interview in a randomly selected sample of Jewish and Palestinian residents of Jerusalem (N = 150) during a period of marked threat of terrorism and war. We utili**zed **the PTSD Symptom Scale Interview Format (Foa, Riggs, Dancu, & Rothbaum, 1993) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9; Kroenke, Spitzer, & Williams, 2001). We then conducted in-depth, in-person interviews within 2 weeks**, as**sessing PTSD and MD using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI; Kessler et al., 2004). Th**e pr**evalence of PTSD and MD diagnosis ascertained by the 2 assessment modalities was similar. Indices of classification accuracy for the phone interview, using the in-person interview as the standard, ranged from modest to high. Brief phone and in-depth in**-per**son measures of PTSD and MD also correlated similarly with other demograph**ic, st**ress, and coping factors, suggesting convergent validity. Brief phone interviews appear useful for estimating the prevalence of psychological disorders in mass casualty contexts and may have a critical role in both epidemiologic work and guiding public health interventions.  2011 American Psychological Association. eid: 2-s2.0-80052649535
4. **Randomized controlled equivalence trial comparing videoconference and in person delivery of cognitive processing therapy for PTSD**
Introduction: In an effort to improve access to and utilization of health care, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) continues to investigate the effectiveness of video-teleconferencing (VTC) technologies for service delivery. While previous research focused on the efficacy of VTC treatment for post-traumatic **stress** disorder (**PTSD**) in Vietnam era veterans, few studies have evaluated the efficacy of this modality and treatment for the Iraq/Afghanistan era veterans. The aim of this randomized clinical trial was to evaluate equivalence between in person and VTC psychotherapy **for **PTSD in this newer cohort. Methods: Veterans of the Iraq/Afghanistan conflict from two VHA hospitals in the United States were recruited and randomized to receive cognitive processing therapy (C**PT) **for PTSD either in person (IP) or over VTC. Clinician-administered and self-report measures were collected before, during, and after treatment. Results: A trend was observed which suggested that CPT over VTC may be equivalent to the treatment delivered in person, as suggested by previous studies. Regardless of treatment, veterans who received the intervention in both conditions reported significant decreases on post-treatment measures. Discussion: This study highlighted research and clinical challenges in providing services to the newest veteran generation in general as well as unique challenges with VTC. One complicating factor to the statistical power of this study was a treatment dropout rate twice the original estimate. Factors that could have influenced this high dropout rate are explored.  2015,  The Author(s) 2015. eid: 2-s2.0-84971468403
5. **Telemedicine: A cost-reducing means of delivering psychotherapy to rural combat veterans with PTSD**
Background: Although effective psychotherapies for **posttraumat**ic **stress** disorder (**PTSD**) exist, high percentages of Veterans in need of services are unable to access them. One particular challenge to providing cost-effective psychological treatments to Veterans w**ith **PTSD involves the difficulty and high cost of delivering in-person, specialized psychotherapy to Veterans residing in geographically remote locations. The delivery of these services via clinical videoteleconferencing (CVT) has been presented as a potential solution to this access to care problem. Materials and Methods: This study is a retrospective cost analysis of a randomized controlled trial investigating telemedicine service delivery of an anger management therapy for Vetera**ns w**ith PTSD. The parent trial found that the CVT condition provided clinical results that were comparable to the in-person condition. Several cost outcomes were calculated in order to investigate the clinical and cost outcomes associated with the CVT delivery modality relative to in-person delivery. Results: The CVT condition was significantly associated with lower total costs compared with the in-person delivery condition. The delivery of mental health services via CVT enables Veterans who would not normally receive these services access to empirically based treatments. Additional studies addressing long-term healthcare system costs, indirect cost factors at the patient and societal levels, and the use of CVT in other geographic regions of the United States are needed. Conclusions: The results of this study provide evidence that CVT is a cost-reducing mode of service delivery to Ve**tera**ns with PTSD relative to in-person delivery.

6. **BEHAVIORAL ACTIVATION and THERAPEUTIC EXPOSURE for POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER: A NONINFERIORITY TRIAL of TREATMENT DELIVERED in PERSON VERSUS HOME-BASED TELEHEALTH**
Objective Combat veterans returning to society with impairing mental health conditions such as **PTSD** and major depression (MD) report significant barriers to care related to aspects of traditional psychotherapy service delivery (e.g., stigma, travel time, and cost). Hence, alternate treatment delivery methods are needed. Home-based telehealth (HBT) is one such option; however, this delivery mode has not been compared to in person, clinic-based care **for **PTSD in adequately powered trials. The present study was designed to compare relative noninferiority of evidence-based psychotherap**ies **for PTSD and MD, specifically Behavioral Activation and Therapeutic Exposure (BA-TE), when delivered via HBT versus in person, in clinic delivery. Method A repeated measures (i.e., baseline, posttreatment, 3-, 6-month follow-up) randomized controlled design powered for noninferiority analyses was used** to **compare PTSD and MD symptom improvement in response to BA-TE delivered via HBT versus in person, in clinic conditions. Participants were 232 veterans diagnosed with full criteria or predefin**ed s**ubthre**shol**d PTSD. Results PTSD and MD symptom improvement following BA-TE delivered by HBT was comparable to that of BA-TE delivered in person at posttreatment and at 3- and 12-month follow-up. Conclusion Evidence-**base**d psychotherapy for PTSD and depression can be safely and effectively delivered via HBT with clinical outcomes paralleling those of clinic-based care delivered in person. HBT, thereby, addresses barriers to care related to both logistics and stigma.  2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-84964643214
7. **Therapist adherence and competence with manualized cognitive-behavioral therapy for PTSD delivered via videoconferencing technology**
Using secondary analyses from a randomized trial comparing the effectiveness of manualized cognitive-behavioral therapy for **posttraumat**ic **stress** disorder, we compared ratings of therapist competency and adherence between two service delivery modes: telepsychiatry (TP) and same room (SR). Patients were 38 male treatment-seeking veterans recruited from a veterans affairs medical center. Domains of therapist competence and adherence included structuring sessions, implementing session activities, providing feedback, dealing with difficulties, developing rapport, and conveying empathy. Only one difference emerged between the two treatment conditions, with more favorable ratings on this item in the TP condition. Findings suggest that therapist competence and adherence to cognitive-behavioral therapy is similar whether the treatment is delivered via TP or by traditional means, and TP does not compromise therapists' ability to effectively structure sessions or build rapport with patients. These data further support the use of TP to address shortages in access to mental health care.  2007 Sage Publications. eid: 2-s2.0-34848840294
8. **Effectiveness of cognitive behavioural therapy administered by videoconference for posttraumatic stress disorder**
Telehealth, or health care via videoconferencing, constitutes a clinical option that makes it possible to treat patients remotely. A growing number of studies have demonstrated that telehealth is a feasible and effective method for diagnostic interviews and psychiatric consultations. However, few studies have assessed the effectiveness of psychotherapy given by videoconference. This study examines the effectiveness of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) administered by videoconference for **posttraumat**ic **stress** disorder (**PTSD**). Forty-eight participants w**ith **PTSD were recruited for the study: 16 in the videoconferencing condition and 32 in a control face-to-face condition. Each participant received CBT for 16 to 25 weeks and completed various questionnaires before and after treatment. The results show a significant decline in the frequency and severity** of posttra**umatic symptoms after treatment in both conditions. A clinical improvement in overall functioning was also observed. No significant difference was observed in the effectiveness of the two therapeutic conditions. The examination of effect sizes supports these results. A number of clinical implications and certain avenues for future research are discussed. eid: 2-s2.0-61549135353
9. **A randomized trial of telepsychiatry for post-traumatic stress disorder**
We compared the efficacy of telepsychiatry and same-room treatment of combat-related post-traumatic **stress** disorder (**PTSD**) using cognitive behavioural therapy in 14 weekly, 90-min treatment sessions. Of 97 patients referred for study participation, 38 were randomized (17 into telepsychiatry, 21 into same-room), and approximately 25 (the number differed by instrument) had at least one post-baseline assessment. Measures of clinical and process outcomes were examined. No group differences were found on clinical outcomes at threemonth follow-up. Satisfaction with treatment ratings was similar in both groups, with 'strong satisfaction' indicated by veterans in both modalities. Attendance and drop-out were similar in the two groups. The sameroom group reported more comfort in talking with their therapist at post-treatment and had better treatment adherence. The results provide preliminary support for the use of telepsychiatry in the treatment** of **PTSD to improve access to care. eid: 2-s2.0-34548423717
10. **Bipolar disorder and PTSD screening and telepsychiatry diagnoses in primary care**
Objective: To describe clinical diagnoses from telepsychiatrist consultation in safety net primary care settings for adult patients screening positive for bipolar disorder, **PTSD**, or both. Methods: Patients were administered **the **PTSD Checklist (PCL-6) and the Composite International Diagnostic Interview 3.0 (CIDI) for bipolar disorder. Positive screening result definitions were PCL-6 score of 14 and CIDI positive stem question responses and score of 8. Patient characteristics were assessed by survey. Psychiatrists consulted in primary care via telehealth and recorded clinical diagnoses. Results: Among 767 patients attending consultation with a telepsychiatrist, 495 (65%) screened PCL-6 positive only, 249 (32%) screened both PCL-6 and CIDI positive, and 23 (3%) screened CIDI positive. Approximately two-thirds screening PCL-6 positive were diagnos**ed w**ith PTSD, and most had comorbid mood disorder diagnoses, with bipolar disorder diagnosis occurring more often in those screening CIDI positive compared to negative (42% vs. 15%). Positive predictive values were 64.9% for PCL-6 and 43.8% for CIDI. Conclusion: Most individuals screening p**osit**ive for PTSD and/or bipolar disorder had two or more psychiatric diagnoses; misclassification exists for both instruments but was greater for CIDI. Psychiatrist consultation early in treatment for individuals screening positive on the PCL-6 and/or CIDI could help clarify diagnoses and improve treatment planning.  2020 The Authors eid: 2-s2.0-85084993436
11. **Changes in Coping and Negative Cognitions as Mechanisms of Change in Online Treatment for Rape-Related Posttraumatic Stress Disorder**
Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)based interventions, including those administered via telepsychology, represent **efficaci**ous **posttraumat**ic **stress** disorder (**PTSD**) treatments. Despite demonstrated efficacy, limited research has examined mechanisms of change for CBT. We examined trauma-related cognitions and coping as treatment mechanisms among 46 women who completed a randomized clinical trial of a CBT-based, telepsychology-delivered interactive program for rape survivors. The results indicated that both the interactive program, d = 1.5, and the active control condition, a psychoeducational website, d = 1.4, resulted in large reductions in postt**est **PTSD symptoms. Analysis of residual gain scores showed that reductions in the three types of assessed trauma-related cognitions were strongly related to reduct**ions** in PTSD symptoms among women assigned to the interactive program, rs =.60.79, but only weakly related to symptom reduction among those assigned to active control, rs =.06.31. The results also suggest that increases in trauma-related approach coping were weakly related to re**duct**ions in PTSD symptoms among participants in the interactive program, rs = .16 and .17, but, conversely, decreases in trauma-related approach coping were weakly related t**o re**ductions in PTSD symptoms among those in the active control group, rs =.07 and.28. Reductions in avoidance coping were modestly relat**ed t**o reductions in PTSD symptoms among women in the interactive program, rs =.38 and.38, but **unre**lated to changes in PTSD symptoms among those assigned to the active control, rs =.03 and.05. Implications for future work examini**ng m**echanisms of change for PTSD treatments are discussed.  2019 International Society for Trauma**tic St**ress Studies eid: 2-s2.0-85075531204
12. **Telepsychiatry- based care for the treatment follow-up of iranian war veterans with post- traumatic stress disorder: A randomized controlled trial**
Background: Physical limitations, distance, and time are major obstacles to access to mental health services for veterans and soldiers. This study was aimed at comparing the efficacy of telepsychiatry and face-to-face consultation as methods of treating post-traumatic **stress** disorder (**PTSD**). The comparison was based on treatment costs, access to health services, completion of therapy sessions, and patient satisfaction as variables. Methods: This research was a double blinded clinical trial supported by Tabriz University of Medical Sciences and conducted in 2015 to 2016 in Tabriz, Iran. Totally, 60 patients were included in the study. Through simple randomization, the patients were divided into experimental and control groups, both of whom were treated through face-to-face consultations for the first 3 sessions. Six follow-up sessions were then held remotely with the experimental group and face to face with the control group. Data were collected using a self-designed and reliable questionnaire and entered in SPSS, version 16. Intergroup comparisons were performed using descriptive statistical measures. Finally, the results were tested using the t test method. Results: A significant relationship was found between the use of information technology and increased patient satisfaction, completion of therapy sessions, and reduction in treatment costs; however, no significant difference was found between the groups in terms of reduction in waiting time and access to a psychiatrist. Conclusion: Telepsychiatry is an effective means of delivering mental health services to psychiatric outpatients living in remote areas with limited resources. The results provide preliminary support for the use of telepsychiatry in treat**ing **PTSD and improving access to care.  2019, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences.

13. **Early treatment withdrawal from evidence-based psychotherapy for PTSD: Telemedicine and in-person parameters**
Objective: To determine differences in reported barriers to treatment completion associated with telemedicine vs. in-person delivery of evidence-based treatment for **PTSD** in combat veterans. Method: The present study was derived from two ongoing randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing in-person vs. telemedicine delivery of exposure therapy **for **PTSD. A onetime telephone assessment of participants who dropped out from the treatment phase of these two studies was conducted, with measures focusing on reported reasons for dropout, and perceived comfort and efficacy of the treatment modality. Dichotomous data were analyzed via chi-square and logistic regression; continuous data via ANOVA. Results: Forty-seven of 69 total dropouts participated. There was no difference in rate of dropout between modalities. A greater proportion of participants receiving in-person exposure therapy reported difficulties with logistical aspects of care (e.g., parking), whereas a greater proportion of participants receiving telemedicine therapy reported difficulty tolerating certain **stress**ful aspects of treatment; however, those receiving telemedicine delivered treatment completed more sessions before dropping out. Participants in both conditions reported that they liked and were confident in their therapist Conclusions: Dropout reasons varied according to type of treatment delivery. Recommendations for future research are given in terms of modification of treatment protocol according to delivery modality.  2014, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-84988260168

Objective: **Neuropsycholog**ical **test** **batteri**es are administered **in person** to assess **cognit**ive function in both clinical and research settings. However, in-person **administr**ation holds a number of logistical challenges that makes it difficult to use in large or remote populations or for multiple serial assessments over time. The purpose of this descriptive study was to determine whether a telephone-administe**red neuropsych**ologi**cal **test battery correlated well with in**-per**son testing. Methods: Fifty English-speaking patients without dementia, over 70 years old, and part of a cohort of patients in a prospective cohort study examin**ing co**gnitive outcomes following elective surgery were enrolled in this study. Five well-va**lidated neurop**s**ycho**logical tests were administered by telephone to each participant by a trained interviewer within 24 weeks of the most recent in-pe**rson** interview. Tests included the Hopk**ins **Verbal Learning Test-Revised, Digit Span, Category Fluency, Phonemic Flu**ency**, and Boston Naming Test. A **Genera**l Cognitive Performance composite score was ca**lcul**ated from individual subtest scores as a Z-score. Results: Mean age was 74.9 years (SD = 4.1), 66% female, and 4% non-White. Mean and interquartile distributions of telephone scores were **similar** to in-person **scor**es. Correlation **analysi**s of test scores revealed significant correlations between telephone and in-pe**rson** results for each individual subtest, as well as for the overall composite score. A BlandAltman plot revealed **no b**ias or trends in scoring for either t**est admin**istration type. Conclusions: In this descriptive study, the te**leph**one v**ersion of a ne**uropsychological test battery correlated well with the in-person version and may provide a feasible supplement in clinical and research applications.

1. **Rejection of the visual in telepsychotherapy**
Despite the progressively decreasing cost and complexity of videotelephones and computer videoconferencing, the telephone remains the preferred instrument of most psychoanalysts and psychotherapists for treatment at a distance, some even proclaiming the advantages of neither seeing nor being seen. This communication addresses possible causal and consequential implications of this rejection of the visual. Pertinent contributory factors considered include: individual variations in preference for sensory modalities, a neophobic reaction of anxious befuddlement in the face of new technology, habit, and institutionalized bias. The psychoanalytic rationale for the use of the couch with its attendant visual deprivation is reviewed in the light of linguistic theory and research advances in the **neuropsycholog**y of nonverbal communication.

2. **A Flexible and Integrated System for the Remote Acquisition of Neuropsychological Data in Stroke Research**
Background: **Neuropsycholog**ical **test**ing is a central aspect of stroke research because it provides critical information about the **cognit**ive-behavioral status of stroke survivors, as well as the diagnosis and treatment of stroke-related disorders. Stand**ard neuropsych**ological methods rely upon face-to-face interactions between a patient and researcher, which creates geographic and logistical barriers that impede research progress and treatment advances. Introduction: To overcome these barriers, we created a flexible and integrated system for the remote acquisi**tion of neurop**sychological data (RAND). The system we developed has a secure architecture that permits collaborative videoconferencing. The system supports shared audiovisual feeds that can provide continuous virtual interaction between a participant and researcher throughou**t a **testing session. Shared presentation and computing controls can be used to deliver auditory and** vis**ual test items adapted from **standard** face-to-face materials or execute computer-based assessments. Spoken and manual responses can be acquired, and the components of the session can be recorded for offline data **analysi**s. Materials and Methods: To evaluate its feasibility, our RAND system was used to administer a spee**ch-l**anguage test battery to 16 stroke survivors with a variety of communication, sensory, and motor impairments. The sessions were initiated virtually without prior face-to-face instruction in the RAN**D te**chnology or test batter**y. Results: Ne**uropsychological data were successfully acquired from all participants, including those with limited technology experience, and those with a communication, sensory, or motor impairment. Furthermore, participants indicated a high level of satisfaction with the RAND system and the remote assessment that it permits. Conclusions: The results indicate the feasibility of using the RAND system for vir**tual home-base**d neuropsychological assessment without prior face-to-face contact between a participant and researcher. Because our RAND system architecture uses off-the-shelf technology and software, it can be duplicated without specialized expertise or equipment. In sum, our RAND system offers a readily available and promising alternat**ive to face-to**-face neuropsychological assessment in stroke research.

3. **Videoconference-based mini mental state examination: A validation study**
Background: **Neuropsycholog**ical **test**ing is a prime criterion of good practice to document **cognit**ive deficits in a rapidly aging population. Telecommunication technologies may overcome limitations related** to **test **administr**ation. We compared performance of the Italian videoconference-based version of the Mini Mental State Examination (VMMSE) with performance of the **standard** MMSE administered face-to-face (F2F), to validate the Italian version of the 28-item VMMSE. Materials and Methods: To validate the Italian version of the VMMSE, we compared its performance w**ith stan**dard F2F. The sample (n=342) was administered three VMMSEs within 6 weeks af**ter **F2F testing. We identified the optimal cutoff through the receiver operating characteristic curve, as well as the VMMSE consistency through inter- and intrarater reliability (Inter/RR and Intra/RR) **analysi**s. Results: We found high levels of sensitivity and specificity for the optimal VMMSE cutoff identification and an accuracy of 0.96 (95% confidence interval 0.94-0.98). Intra/RR and inter/RR were highly significant. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that VMMSE is a valid instrument in clinical and research screening and monitoring of subjects affected** by co**gnitive disorders. This study shows a significant correlation between videoconference assessment and the F2F one, providing an important impetus to expand studies and the knowledge about the usefulness of tele-assistance services. Our findings have important implications for both longitudinal assistance and clinical care of demented patients.  2013 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-84889690302
4. **A Pilot Trial of Neuropsychological Evaluations Conducted via Telemedicine in the Veterans Health Administration**
Introduction: Many veterans live in rural areas distant from Veterans Affairs Medical Centers (VAMCs) and receive primary medical care from community-based outpatient clinics (CBOCs). These veterans often must travel great distances to the nearest VAMC for **neuropsycholog**ical evaluations, resulting in poor access to care, travel reimbursement costs, fee-basis evaluations of uncontrolled quality, and driving safety concerns. Return trips for feedback compound complications. Accordingly, we initiated a pilot trial** of neuropsych**ological evaluation and feedback via telemedicine (i.e., clinical videoconferencing). Subjects and Methods: Participants were veterans refer**red for neurop**sychological evaluation from a rural CBOC 115 miles from the regional VAMC. All veterans were given the choice to undergo evaluation at the CBOC via telemedicine or in-person at the VAMC. Telemedicine equipment allowed presentation of digitized material with simultaneous patient observation. **Test**ing materials were organized in numbered folders and given to veterans by CBOC clerks immediately prior to evaluation. Clerks returned completed materials via facsimile. Results: Fifteen veterans from the rural CBOC we**re seen for ne**uropsychological evaluation. Eight chose telemedicine evaluation. Groups based on evaluation modality appeared **similar** on demographics, referral basis, resulting neuropsychiatric diagnoses, and follow-through on recommendations. No significant technical or clinical difficulties were encountered, and veterans reported satisfaction with telemedicine. All veterans requested feedback via telemedicin**e. Conclusions**: Neuropsychological evaluation via telemedicine is feasible and appears comparable to in-person evaluation. Experiences are encouraging and consistent with the broader literature on the acceptance of and satisfaction with clinical videoconferencing. Future studies will assess possible psychometric issues in clinical populations.  Copyright 2012, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2012. eid: 2-s2.0-84869001703
5. **Teleneuropsychology: Evidence for video teleconference-based neuropsychological assessment**
The use of videoconference technology to deliver health care diagnostics and treatment continues to grow at a rapid pace. Telepsychiatry and telepsychology applications are well-accepted by patients and providers, and both diagnostic and treatment outcomes have generally been **similar** to traditional face-to-face interactions. Preliminary applications of videoconference-based **neuropsycholog**ical assessment (**teleneuropsych**ology) have yielded promising results in the feasibility and reliability of several **standard** **test**s, although large-scale studies are lacking. This investigation was conducted to determine the reliability of video teleconference (VTC) **- based neurop**sychological assessment using a brief battery ****of stan**dard ne**uropsychologi**cal **tests commonly used in the evaluation of known or suspected de**ment**ia. Tests included the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Hopkins Verb**al L**earning Test-Revised, Digit Span forward and backward, short for**m Bo**ston Naming Test, Letter and Category Fluency,** and** Clock Drawing. Tests were administered via VTC and in-person to subjects, counterb**alan**ced using alternate test fo**rms and **standard instructions. Two hund**red **two adult subjects were tested in both rural and urban settings, including 83 with **cognit**ive impairment and 119 healthy controls. We found hig**hly sim**ilar results across VTC and in-person conditions, with significant intraclass correlations (mean**=.74**; range: 0.55-0.91) between test scores. Findings remained consistent in subjects with or with**out co**gnitive impairment and **in person**s with MMSE scores as low a**s** 15.** VTC-base**d neuropsychological testing is a valid and reliable alternative to traditional face-to-face assessment using selected measures. **More** VTC-based studies using additional tests in different populations are need**ed t**o fully explore the utility of this new testing medium.

1. **Predicting engagement with an online psychosocial intervention for psychosis: Exploring individual- and intervention-level predictors**
Background: Individuals with psychosis demonstrate positive attitudes towards utilising digital technology in mental health treatment. Although preliminary research suggests digital interventions are feasible and acceptable in this **popul**ation, little is known about how to best promote engagement with these resources. Candidate predictors include therapist support, sources of motivation and recovery style. Understanding what factors predict engagement w**ill** aid more effective **design** and implementation of digital interventions to improve clinical benefits. Objective: This study aimed to investigate demographic, psychological, and treatment variables that predict overall and type of engagement with a psychosocial, online intervention for individuals with psychosis. Methods: Ninety-eight participants with a history of psychosis were given access to a web program containing modules on self-management and recovery, which they were asked to use flexibly at their own pace. Activity was automatically logged by the **system**. Baseline measures of demographics, recovery style and motivation were administered, and participants were randomised to receive either website access alone, or website access plus weekly, asynchronous emails from an online coach over 12 weeks. Log and baseline assessment data were used in negative binomial regressions to examine predictors of depth and breadth of use over the intervention period. A logistic regression was used to examine the impact of predictor variables on **usag**e profiles (active or passive). Results: Depth and breadth of engagement were positively predicted by receiving email support, low levels of externally controlled motivations for website use, older age, and having a tertiary education. There was a significant interaction between level of controlled motivation and condition (+/email) on breadth and depth of engagement: receiving asynchronous emails was associated with increased engagement for individuals with low, but not high, levels of externally controlled motivations. Receiving email support and more autonomous motivations for treatment predicted more active use of the website. Conclusions: Asynchronous email support can promote engagement with online interventions for individuals with psychosis, potentially enabling self-management** of** illness and improving clinical outcomes. However, those using online interventions due to external motivating factors, may have low levels of engagement with the intervention, irrespective of coaching provided. These findings may gu**ide de**sign and implementation of future online interventions in t**his p**opulation.  2019 The Authors eid: 2-s2.0-85070855127
2. **Design, development and implementation of a smartphone overdependence management system for the self-control of smart devices**
Background: **Smartphon**e overdependence is a type of mental disorder that requires continuous treatment for cure and prevention**. A smart**phone overdependence management **system** that is based on scientific evidence is required. This study proposes the **design**, development and implementati**on of a s**martphone overdependence managem**ent sy**stem for self-control of smart devices. Metho**ds: Th**e system architec**ture of t**he Smartphone Overdependence** Manag**ement System (SOMS) primarily consists of four sessions of mental monitoring: (1) Baseline settlement session; (2) Assessment session; (3) Sensing & monitoring session; and (4) Analysis and feedback session. W**e develop**ed the smartphone-**usag**e-monitoring application (app) and MindsCare personal computer (PC) app to receive and integr****ate **usage** data from smartp**hone user**s. We analyzed sma**rtph**one usage data using the Chi-square Automatic Interaction Detector (CHAID). Based on the baseline settlement results,** we de**signed a feedback service to intervene. We **implem**ented the system using 96 participants for testing and validation. The participants were clas**sified in**to two groups: the smartphone us**age contr**ol group (SUC) and the** sma**rtphone usage disorder addiction g**roup (SUD**). Results: The background smartphone monitoring **app of** the pro**posed sys**tem successfully monitored** the** smartphone usage based on the devel**oped** algorithm. The usage minutes of the S**UD w**ere higher than the usage minutes of the SUC in 11 of the 16 categories developed in our study. Via the MindsCare PC app, the data were successfully integrated and stored, and managers can successfully analyze and diagnose based on the monitored data. Conclu**sion: **The SOMS is a new system that is based on inte**grated pe**rsonalized data for evidence-based smartphone overdependence intervention. The SOM****S i**s usef**ul for managing usage data, diagnosing smartph**one **overdependence, classifying usage patterns and predicting smar**tphone** overdependence.

3. **Usability of online psychoeducation for siblings of people with psychosis**
Objectives: The E Sibling Project aims to address the needs of siblings of individuals affected by psychosis through provision of a comprehensive online intervention. The online intervention comprises four core elements, including: information on psychosis; various coping and promoting well-being strategies; siblings' blogs and discussion forum with peers; and an Ask the Experts function. After the intervention-prototype was developed, we tested its feasibility, usability and acceptability by siblings. Methods: We **evalu**ated the usability of the intervention-prototype using a non-randomised usability study with siblings of individuals diagnosed with psychosis. The usability study adapted Poulson et al's framework to collect subjective feedback from participants on ease of use, perceived usefulness and acceptability, together with objective **usag**e data on the intervention. Results: Twenty siblings were recruited to the usability test; 19 tried out the resource-prototype over a 4-week period and 17 completed the onl**ine e**valuation after using the intervention. In total, 906 page-views were made by the participants and each spent about two hours using the resource. Parti**cipan**ts evaluated the intervention as helpful, relevant and useful in terms of content, **design** and usability. Developments are needed to improve the navigation and intuitiveness of the resource. Conclusions: Using an internet-based information-giving and peer support intervention to promote wellbeing and coping is feasible and acceptable to siblings of people with psychosis.

Objective To assess current payment practice for **telerehab**ilitation in state Medicaid programs. **Design** Telephone survey. Setting State Medicaid programs. Participants State Medicaid directors. Interventions Not applicable. Main outcome measure Descriptive. Results Half of the 35 state Medicaid programs contacted reimbursed at least some telemedicine services other than radiology in 2002. The primary reason for reimbursing for telemedicine is to make services available when there is no local practitioner. Consultation and **evalu**ation and management services were most likely to be reimbursed (12 states). Seven state programs reimbursed telepsychology, and 4 states reported reimbursing for telespeech and language pathology, physical therapy, or occupational therapy. Conclusions Telemedicine helps Medicaid programs deliver specialized care to locations with provider shortag**es. Teler**ehabilitation is not yet widespread, despite its potential benefit to people with disabilities who cannot travel to a** clinic f**or rehabilitation therapy. Most Medicaid programs calculate the financial costs and patient benefits when considering payment policies, and about half of states require a state law to allow **payment f**or telerehabilitation.

5. **Process of design and usability evaluation of a telepsychology web and virtual reality system for the elderly: Butler**
Butler is a multi-application **system** based on Internet technology and **virtual r**eality, **design**ed to meet the needs of elderly users. Its objectives are to assist elderly **popul**ations in accessing technology and new forms of communication, replicating, as far as possible the way of lineal interaction that t**his p**opulation group had traditionally to interact with information in order to facilitate the first contacts with technology. Butler is equipped with e-mail, videoconferencing, blogging, access to the Internet through a well-known web search engine, image and sound gallery, new contacts searcher, and **two virtu**al reality environments. In this paper we describe Butler's most relevant features taking into account the usabil**ity de**sign process and the usability **evalu**ation of **the sy**stem, which, after pilot testing, have proven to be highly acceptable and satisfactory to users. We also present the results** of e**valuations pertaining to the iconography used in the program, the navigation and user**s' hel**p design process, and the first functional prototype, all of** which** were** desig**ned and redesigned with the aid of web heuristics and gui**deline**s for the web design for elderly users.

The Butler **system** is an e-health platform **design**ed to improve the elderly **popul**ation's quality of life. The But**ler sy**stem has three applications diagnostic, therapeutic and playful. The objective of this work is to present the influence of the use of the platform on elderly users' mood states and the degree of acceptance. These measures were assessed through visual analogical scales before and after the platform use, with the outcome measures MANOVAS analyses were performed. Seventeen users (from 58 to 79 years old) completed four sessions w**ith th**e system; they could choose which technological resources they used in each session. The results showed that afte**r usin**g the system, the participants' insensitive emotions increased and their negative ones decreased. In addition, they obtained high levels of satisfaction, low levels of subjective difficulty and would recommend Butler to other users. Therefore, the results indicate that Butler might **be an **effective system for improving emotional states in elde**rly p**opulation.  2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. eid: 2-s2.0-77957994043
7. **Towards a Framework for Evaluating Mobile Mental Health Apps**
Introduction: Mobile phones are ubiquitous in society and owned by a majority of psychiatric patients, including those with severe mental **ill**ness. Their versatility as a platform can extend mental health services in the areas of communication, self-monitoring, self-management, diagnosis, and treatment. However, the efficacy and reliability of publicly available applications (apps) have yet to be demonstrated. Numerous articles have noted the need for rigorous **evalu**ation of the efficacy and clinical utility of **smartphon**e apps, which are largely unregulated. Professional clinical organizations do not provide guidelines **for e**valuating mobile apps. Materials and Methods: Guidelines and frameworks are ne**eded **to evaluate medical apps. Numerous fra**mewor**ks and evaluation criteria exist from the engineering and informatics literature, as well as interdisciplinary organizations in similar fields such as telemedicine and healthcare informatics. Results: We propose criteria for both patients and providers to use in assessing not j**ust smart**phone apps, but also wearable devices and smartwatch apps for mental heal**th. A**pps can be evaluated by their usefulness, usability, and integration and infrastructure. Apps can be categorized by their usability in one or more stages of a mental health provider's workflow. Conclusions: Ultimately, leadership is needed to develop a framework for describing apps, and guidelines are needed for both patients and mental health providers.

Obesity prevalence is nearly double among individuals with serious mental **ill**ness (SMI), including schizophrenia spectrum disorders, bipolar disorder, or major depressive disorder, compared with the general **popul**ation. Emerging mobile health (m-health) technologies are increasingly available and offer the potential to support lifestyle interventions targeting weight loss, yet the practical feasibility of using these technologies in this high-risk group has not been established. We **evalu**ated the feasibility and acceptability** of p**opular m-health technologies for activity tracking among overweight and obese individuals with SMI. We provided wearable activity monitoring devices (FitBit [San Francisco, CA] Zip or Nike Inc. [Beaverton, OR] FuelBand) and **smartphon**es (Apple [Cupertino, CA] iPhone 4S) for accessing **the smart**phone application for each device to participants with SMI enrolled in a weight loss program. Feasibility of these devices was measured by the frequency of use over time. Acceptability was measured through qualitative follow-up interviews with participants. Ten participants with SMI wore the devices for a mean of 89% (standard deviation=13%) of the days in the study. Five participants wore the devices 100% of the time. Participants reported high satisfaction, stating the devices were easy to use, helpful for setting goals, motivational, and useful for self-monitoring. Several participants liked the social connectivity feature of the devices where they could see each other's progress** on the s**martphone application, noting that "friendly" competition increased motivation to be more physically active. This study support**s usi**ng popular m-health technologies for activity tracking among individuals with SMI. These findings can inform the **design** of weight loss interventions targeting this vulnera**ble p**atient population.  Copyright 2015, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2015. eid: 2-s2.0-84924815083
9. **Usability analysis of a system for cognitive rehabilitation, "gradior", in a Spanish Region**
Objective: The main aim of our research is to assess the use, satisfaction, and pedagogy of software for neuropsychological **rehabilit**ation by computer, called "Gradior," to obtain relevant information on the impact of information and communications technology on people with severe and prolonged mental **ill**ness. Methods: To **evalu**ate the usability and satisfaction standards, the questionnaire "Usability survey on the use of the cognit**ive rehab**ilitation and assessment program by computer" was completed by 83 patients of the Rodrguez Chamorro Hospital. Results: The results of the study show that Gradior has 81.2% acceptance and 83.7% general assessment. This indicates that those who responded to the survey consider that the Gradior program improves cognitive functions and abilities in patients with severe and prolonged men**tal** illness and therefore their quality of life. Conclusion: This research is oriented toward professionals of the Health Area and **System**s Engineers, who develop software for neuropsycho**logical r**ehabilitation with neurocognitive deficit. The purpose is to make the learning process more effective among the people who use it and to improve usability for specific groups. We hope that the reading of the work contributes to the activities, techniques and materials planned are in accordance with the needs of the **popul**ation affected with cognitive disorders.  2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-85084640524

Objective: Providing specialized healthcare to **rural** communities can be extremely difficult, and consequently many health organizations are turning to the use of telehealth technologies for care delivery. One such technology, remote monitoring, has been successfully implemented with patients suffering from chronic and other medical conditions. A drawback, however, is that remote monitoring devices are programmed to reach a broad audience, and consequently the content may not be suitable for all patients - especially those who are not a part of the dominant **cultur**e. Subjects and Methods: This **report** provides a model for adapting remote monitoring to specific populations who are undergoing care for posttraumatic **stress** disorder. Adaptation changes focus on (1) information gathering, (2) process and dialogue changes, (3) testing, and (4) patient and administrative feedback. Data for such modifications were gathered through a series of community meetings, patient interviews, and provider feedback. A case example highlights the successful implementation of the adaptation model fo**r a r**ural **American **Indian**** Veteran population. Results: Patients showed high acceptability of both the programmatic **and cu**ltural adaptations. Feasibility of the program also appeared positive, with most patie**nts re**porting that the readability of the program was appropriate, the dialogue duration was not burdensome, and technical problems were rare. Conclusions: Remote monitoring provides the ability to be modified for use with certain subpopulations. Procedural recommendations **in thi**s report highlight special considerations for working w**ith American In**dians living on or near reservation areas, although the model can be broadly adapted to several groups.

1. **The diffusion of telehealth in rural American Indian communities: A retrospective survey of key stakeholders**
Objective: Mental health issues are a serious concern for many **American **Indian**** Veterans, especially for post-traumatic **stress** disorder and related psychiatric conditions. Yet, acquiring mental health treatment can be a challenge in Native communities where specialized services are largely unavailable. Consequently, telehealth is increasingly being suggested as a way to expand healthcare access on or near reservation lands. In this study, we wanted to understand the factors affecting the diffusion of telehealth clinics that provided mental health care to rur**al, American In**dian Veterans. Materials and Methods: We surveyed 39 key personnel and stakeholders who were involved in the decision-making process, technological infrastructure, and implementation of three clinics. Using Roger Everett's Diffusion Theory as a framework, we gathered information about specific tasks, factors hindering progress, and personal reactions to telehealth both before and after implementation. Results: Many participants expressed initial concerns about using telehealth; however, most became positive over time. Factors that influenced participants' viewpoint largely included patient and staff feedback and witnessing the fulfillment of a community health need. The use of outside information to support the implementation of the clinics and personal champions also showed considerable influence in the clinics' success. Conclusion: The findings presented here address critical gaps in our understanding of telehealth diffusion and inform research strategies regarding the **cultur**al issues and outcomes related to telemental health services. Information contained in this **report** serves as a long overdue guide for developing telemental health programs and policie**s among America****n In**dians, specifically, and **rural** populations in general.  2012 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-84856690652
2. **Telepsychiatric care of American Indian Veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder: Bridging gaps in geography, organizations, and culture**
This paper describes a weekly telepsychiatry clinic treating post-traumatic **stress** disorder (PTSD) among Northern Plains **American **Indian**** Veterans. The clinic represents a unique partnership of five different organizations, including two agencies within the Veterans Affairs Administration, a tribal veterans program, **the In**dian Health Service, and a university medical center. It is the first **report** of a telepsychiatry clinic target**ing American In**dians, as well as the first account of a telepsychiatry clinic focusing on PTSD treatment. A total of 50 telehealth clinic interactions occurred during the first 7 months, consisting of ongoing group psychotherapy, individual therapy, and medication management. Quality control measures exhibited a high degree of patient satisfaction and comfort with the clinic. Although the findings presented here are preliminary, this clinic represents a viable model for the delivery of telepsychiatric services. Future research is needed regarding the process and outcomes of delivering psychiatric care by this means for **rural**, is**olated, Ame**rica****n Indians, as well as of the treatment of PTSD via real-time, interactive videoconferencing. eid: 2-s2.0-9644268751

0. **Telepsychiatry as an economically better model for reaching the unreached: A retrospective report from South India**
Aim: In a resource-poor country such as India, telepsychiatry could be an **econom**ical method to expand health-care services. This study was planned to compare the **cost**ing and feasibility of three different service delivery models. The end user was a state-funded long-stay Rehabilitation Center (RC) for the homeless. Methodology: Model A comprised patients going to a tertiary care center for clinical care, Model B was community outreach service, and Model C comprised telepsychiatry services. **The **costing included expenses incurred by the health system to complete a single consultation for a patient on an outpatient basis. It specifically exclu**ded **the cost borne by the care-receiver. No patients were interviewed for the study. Results: The RC had 736 inmates, of which 341 had mental illness of very long duration. On co**mpar**ing the c**osti**ng, Model A costed 6047.5 **INR **(100$), Model B costed 577.1 **INR **(9.1$), and Model C costed 137.2 INR (2.2$). Model C was found fifty times m**ore ec**onomical when compared to Model A and four tim**es mor**e economical when compared to Model B. Conclusion: Telepsychiatry services connecting tertiary center and a primary health-care center have potenti**al to **be an economical model of service delivery compared to other traditional ones.

1. **An economic cost analysis of an expanding, multi-state behavioural telehealth intervention**
Introduction: In this paper the **econom**ic **cost**s associated with a growing, multi-state telepsychiatry intervention serving rural American Indian/Alaska Native populations were compared** to **costs of **travel**ling to provide/receive in-person treatment. Methods: Telepsy**chia**try costs were calculated using administrative, information-technology, equipment and technology components, and were compare**d t**o** tr**avel cost models. Both a **patien**t travel and a p**sychia**trist travel model were estimated utilising ArcGIS so**ftwa**re and unit costs gathered from literature and **gove**rnment sources. Cost structure and sensitivity **analysi**s was also calculated by varying modeling parameters and assumptions. Results and Discussion: It is est**imat**ed that per-session costs were $93.90, $183.34, and $268.23 for telemed**icine,** provider-**travel**, and patient-travel, respectively. Restricting **the ana**lysis to satellite locations with a larger number of visits reduced telemed**icin**e per-patient encounter costs (50 or more visits: $83.52; 100 or more visits: $80.41; and 150 or more** vis**its: $76.25). The estimated cost efficiencies of telemedicine were more evident for highly rural communities. Finally, we found that a multi-state centre was cheaper than each state operating independently. Conclusions: Consistent with previous research, this study provides additional evidence of **the ec**onomic efficiency associated with telemedicine interventions for rural American Indian/Alaska Native populations. Our results suggest that th**ere ar**e economies of scale in providing behavioural telemedicine and that bigger, multi-state tele**medi**cine centres have lower overall costs compared to smaller, state-level centres. Additionally, results suggest that telemedicine structures with a higher number of per-**sate**llite patient encounters have lower costs, and telemedicine centres delivering care to highly rural populations prod**uce gr**eater economic benefits.

2. **Economic evaluation of a tertiary telepsychiatry service to an island**
The island of Jersey is located 160km south of Britain and 23km from northwest France. The island has wellestablished primary and secondary **mental health servic**es, but tertiary services have to be purchased from UK mainland service providers. A pilot study of telepsychiatry was conducted, using videoconferencing to access terti**ary mental health se**rvices from the UK. During a six-month study period, five patient consultations and six specialist presentations were carried out. The total **cost** of using videoconferencing to deliver t**ertiary mental healt**h services not ordinarily available in Jersey was 3483.06. **The **costs of using the traditional model instead would have been 12,975.00. The threshold at which videoconferencing became cheaper than **travel** was between five and six telemedicine episodes per **year**; the actual workload during the pilot study was 22 episodes **per **year. The study suggests that telemedi**cine** is cost-effective for providi**ng tertiary mental h**ealth services not ordinarily available in Jersey. eid: 2-s2.0-39049175410
3. **Evaluation of a routine telepsychiatry service**
An assessment was undertaken of a routine telepsychiatry service in rural areas of a Canadian province as a follow-up to a pilot telepsychiatry project. Over two **year**s, there were 546 consultations at the five participating general hospitals, although the level of use varied considerably between them. Health professionals expressed high satisfaction with the service. While there were equipment problems in 17% of all consultations in the sec**ond **year, they did not seem to affect acceptance of the technique. A **cost** **analysi**s comparing consultations provided by a visiting psychiatrist and telepsychiatry found a break-even point of 348 consulta**tion**s a year. However, when use of the videoconferencing network for administrative meetings was considered, the break-even point was 224 cons**ulta**tions a year, substantially below the actual utilization of telepsychiatry. Telepsychiatry appeared to result in increased access to community **mental health servic**es, suggesting future increased demand for these. From the perspective of health authorities and health professionals, telepsychiatry proved to be a useful and sustainable addition to exist**ing mental health se**rvices. eid: 2-s2.0-0035222533
4. **Evaluation of a telepsychiatry pilot project**
We assessed a telepsychiatry pilot project in which a psychiatric hospital was linked with mental health clinics in five general hospitals. Information was collected through questionnaires administered to patients, service providers and psychiatric consultants, and by interviews. The technology was considered easy to use by participating health-care professionals and patients, and the quality of the sound and picture was adequate. Survey data suggested acceptance and satisfaction on the part of patients, service providers and psychiatric consultants. An **econom**ic **analysi**s indicated that at 396 consultations per **year** the service **cost** the same as providing a **travel**ling psychiatrist (C$610 per consultation); with more consultations, telepsychiatry was cheaper. Information gathered during the **evalu**ation suggested that the use of videoconferencing for psychiatric consultations was a viable option for an integrated, community-based **mental health servic**e. eid: 2-s2.0-0032616627

0. **Challenges in telemedicine and eHealth: lessons learned from 20 years with telemedicine in Troms.**
The Norwegian Centre for **Telemed**icine (NST) has, over the past two decades, contributed to the development and implementation** of tel**emedicine and ehealth services in Norway. From 2002, NST has been a WHO Collaboration Cen**ter for** telemedicine. In August 1996, Norway became the first country to implement **an offi**cial telemedicine fee **schedul**e making telemedicine services reimbursable by the natio**nal hea**lth insurer. Telemedicine is widely used in Northern Norway. Since the late 1980's, the University Hospital of North-Norway has experience in the following areas: teleradiology, **telepatholog**y, **teledermatolog**y, teleotorhinolaryngology (remote endoscopy), remote gastroscopy, tele-echocardiography, remote transmission of ECGs, telepsychiatry, teleophthalmology, teledialysis, teleemergency medicine, teleoncology, telecare, telegeriatric, **teleden**tistry, maritime telemedicine, referrals and discharge letters, electronic delivery of laboratory results and distant teaching for healthcare personnel and patients. Based on the result achieved, the health authority in North-Norway plans to im**plement** several large-scale telemedicine services: Teleradiology (incl. solutions for neurosurgery, orthopedic, different kinds of surgery, nuclear medicine, acute traumatic and oncology), digital communication and integration of patient data, and distant education. In addition, the following services will also be considered for large-scale implementation: teledialysis, prehospital thrombolysis, telepsychiat**ry, teledermat**ology. Last in line for implementation are: pediatric, district medical center (DMS), teleophthalmology and ear-nose-throat (ENT). eid: 2-s2.0-38449120147
1. **Towards learning organisations with telemedicine**
For the post-industrial society, the knowledge and information society, learning is an **import**ant activity. We speak about learning organisations and even a learning society. In healthcare dissemination of knowledge may be a tool for improving patient care. **Work**ing with **telemed**icine has been proposed to result in learning, but research on this is limited. To **investig**ate learning** in tel**emedicine a study was performed with **qualit**ative interviews of 30 pers**ons **working with telepsychiatry, **teledermatolog**y, a **telepatholog**y frozen-section service, and teleotolaryngology. The results clearly sh**ow t**hat worki**ng with** telemedicine provides learning. More than 80% of the respondents revealed that they had learnt something n**ew by u**sing telemedicine and had improved their knowledge of their specialty as well as other areas. All GPs said they had learnt something new, as well as nurses, psychologists, other categories of personnel, and even medical specialists. When all within psychiatry report that they have learnt something new the future learni**ng pote**ntial of telemedicine looks promising for psychiatry. Two-thirds of the respondents could not tell that the learning made them perform tasks for which they previously needed assistance, but the answers may have been dependent on the type of **tele**medical work and the educational background of the respondents. Two-thirds of the respondents thought that something more c**ould be** done** in **telemedical work to promote their own learning, which shows the clear potential for learning by tel**emed**icine**. To st**art working with telemedicine initial instruction seems to be sufficient; a more extensive training programme appears unnecessary. In futur**e with **many applications of telemedicine implemented, healthcare organisations may bec**ome im**portant arenas for learning and leaders will have to focus on learning.

2. **Telemedicine and changes in the distribution of tasks between levels of care**
The present **investig**ation, which was part of a larger study, was designed to answer the question Has **telemed**icine produced changes in the distribution of tasks between the general practitioner and specialist, or between the local hospital and university/central hospital?' **Qualit**ative interviews were carried out with 30 persons involved in f**our tel**emedicine services in Norway: **teledermatolog**y, tele-otolaryngology, telepsychiatry, and a **telepatholog**y frozen-section service. The results indicat**ed that** telemedicine does not produce large changes in the distribution of tasks. The reported effects were largest and most complex for telepsychiatry, followed** by teledermat**ology. Local variat**ions in** how telemedicine is practised may explain the variation in the f**indings** between telemedicine applications.  2002, SAGE Publications.

3. **Changes in the job situation due to telemedicine**
Little is known either about how **telemed**icine changes the job situation or about how the **work**ing environment might be improved for those involved** in tel**emedicine. To **investig**ate these issues, **qualit**ative interviews were carried out with 30 people in Nor**way **working with telepsychiatry (12 respondents), **teledermatolog**y (six respondents), a **telepatholog**y frozen-section service (10 respondents) and tele-otolaryngology (two respondents). The median annual number of remote consultations in telepsychiatry was nine,** in teledermat**ology 81 and in **the telepath**ology frozen-section service nine. The positive asp**ects** of worki**ng with** telemedicine included less travelling, which gave more tim**e fo**r other work, less need to travel in poor weather, new contacts, an increased sense of professional security (because support was readily available) and the satisfaction of seeing partners in communication. At its pres**ent vol**ume, telemedicine generally **fits** into daily work patterns quite well. Problems do occur, but they can be solved by appropriate organizational measures. Long-ter**m sched**uling of telemedical sessions may be **im**port**a**nt**. Ma**ny telemedicine workers want to have the equipme**nt i**n their o**wn offi**ce. Working with telemedicine can be tiring and those interviewed wanted to limit the number of hours per week. A solution may be to use large clinics, such as univer**sity cl**i**nics**, where the telemedical work could be distributed bet**ween se**veral specialists. Large telemedicine clinics with a full-time dedicated staff woul**d ne**ed careful consideration of working practices. eid: 2-s2.0-0036362003
4. **Telemedical work and cooperation**
In **telemed**icine, cooperation occurs via telecommunication. This represents a new situation for medical cooperation. Whether such cooperation **work**s poorly or well will be **import**ant with an increasing volume** of tel**emedicine. When personnel are involved in external cooperation**, as in** telemedicine, the question of cooperation within one's own organization also arises. To **investig**ate these matters, **qualit**ative interviews were performed with 30 pers**ons **working in **teledermatolog**y, telepsychiatry, a **telepatholog**y frozen-section service and tele-otolaryngology. The results showed that cooperating by telecommunication** mai**nly worked well. The cooperation may be influenced by factors such as personality, knowing each other personally, preparation and experience. Tele**medi**cal teamwork may be improved by factors like experience** and** education. W**orking **with telemedicine did not reduce the personnel's cooperation within their own organizations, but rather improved it, although this effect was slight and most commonly involved improved knowledge of others. In general, the findings concerning **coopera**tion and telemedicine were positive. eid: 2-s2.0-0035224111
5. **Learning in organizations working with telemedicine**
To **investig**ate learning in **telemed**icine, **qualit**ative interviews were conducted with 30 people **work**ing with telepsychiatry, **teledermatolog**y, a **telepatholog**y frozen-section service and tele-otolaryngology. More than 80% of the respondents said that they had learnt something new by us**ing tel**emedicine. Most frequently the participants improved their knowledge of the specialty in which they were involved, but this was not the only way in which they learnt. The learning did not necessarily change behaviour, as two-thirds of the respondents felt that the learning had not permitted them to perform tasks for which they had previously needed assistance (although this varied somewhat with the **type of** telemedi**cal **work that respondents were engaged in). Two-thirds of respondents thought that something more could be done in tele**medi**cal work to promote their own learning, which shows the clear potential for **learnin**g by telemedicine. Learning could be promoted further by extending the use of the technology to other application**s. T**o sta**rt work**ing with telemedicine, initial instruction seems to be sufficient - a more extensive training programme appears unnecessary. In future, as m**any app**lications of telemedicine are implemented, health-care organizations may become **import**ant arenas for learning and leaders will have to focus on learning. The results of the present study clea**rly **s**howed t**hat working with telemedicine produces learning. eid: 2-s2.0-0036366717
6. **Provider barriers to telemental health: Obstacles overcome, obstacles remaining**
Many providers are hesitant to use telemental health technologies. When providers are queried, various barriers are presented, such as the clinician's skepticism about the effectiveness of telemental health (TMH), viewing telehealth technologies as inconvenient, or reporting difficulties with medical reimbursement. Provider support for TMH is critical to its diffusion because clinicians often serve as the initial gatekeepers to telehealth implementation and program success. In this article, we address provider concerns in three broad domains: (1) personal barriers, (2) clinical **work**flow and technology barriers, and (3) licensure, credentialing, and reimbursement barriers. We found evidence that, although many barriers have been discussed in the literature for years, advancements in TMH have rapidly reduced obstacles for its use. Improvements include extensive opportunities for training, a growing evidence base supporting positive TMH outcomes, and transformations in technologies that improve provider convenience and transmission **qualit**y. Recommendations for further change are discussed within each domain. In particular, it is **import**ant to grow and disseminate data underscoring the promise and effectiveness of TMH, integrate videoconferencing capabilities into electronic medical record platforms, expand TMH reimbursement, and modify licensure standards.  2013, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-84896552508
7. **Telemedicine in northern Norway**
The University Hospital of Troms has been involved in a variety of **telemed**icine activities since the late 1980s, including teleradiology, **telepatholog**y, **teledermatolog**y, remote endoscopy, remote gastroscopy, teleechocardiography, transmission of electrocardiograms, telepsychiatry, electronic delivery of laboratory results and distance learning for health professionals. Since 1993 the department** of tel**emedicine in Troms has been designated the national centre of compet**ence in** telemedicine. With a wealth of experience to draw from, a critical number of health-care professionals exposed t**o and u**sing telemedicine routinely, the support of the Norwegian health authorities, a national** centre** guiding telemedicine research, no licensing barriers within the country, nationwide ISDN an**d reimb**ursement for telemedicine **service**s, the future of telemedicine in Norway looks promising. eid: 2-s2.0-0030632352
8. **A qualitative study of the organizational consequences of telemedicine**
The organizational consequences of **telemed**icine have frequently been mentioned in **the tel**emedicine community, but there are few empirical studies. A study was therefore carried out of what happens in organizatio**ns when** telemedicine is implemented. **Qualit**ative interviews were undertaken with 30 persons **work**ing in **teledermatolog**y, telepsychiatry, a **telepatholog**y frozen-section service and tele-otolaryngology. Almost all respondents reported numerous organizational changes, some **import**ant. Changes** in **work processes were the most common. Examples of the organizational cons**equence**s of telemedicine were organizational restructuring, new organizational units, changed mechanisms for internal coordination, different flows of patients through the health-care system, improved coordination of care, new job descriptions, relocation of the p**lace** of work, employment of personnel living far aw**ay f**rom the workplace, effects on employees not direc**tly inv**olved in telemedicine, sharing of experiences, minor staffing change**s, c**linical teamwork independent of co-location, administrative m**eetings** arranged by telemedicine, merger of organizations independent of location, less travel by staff (and patients), a possible beneficial effect on **the qu**ality of care, and limited opposition to the adop**tion of** the technology. Telemedicine may** be im**portant in the future organization of the disciplines studied and in health-care generally. The infrastructu**re o**f electronic networks may **play a**n important role for org**anizati**ons as the volume of telemedicine activity increases and economies of scale are realized. eid: 2-s2.0-0035229519

0. **States leverage telepsychiatry solutions to ease ED crowding, accelerate care**
Many states are having success turning to telepsychiatry-based solutions to connect mental health patients with **need**ed care while also decompressing crowded EDs. Just one year into a statewide telepsychiatry initiative in North Carolina (NC-STeP), administrators say the approach has saved as much as $7 million, and hospital demand for the service is higher than anticipated. In Texas, mental health emergency **center**s (MHEC) that use telepsychiatry to connect patients in **rural** areas w**ith **needed psychiatric care are freeing up EDs to focus on medical care. In just 11 months, 91 North Carolina hospitals have at least started the process to engage in NC-STeP. Much of the savings from NC-STeP come from involuntary commitment orders being overturned as a result of the telepsychiatry consults, reduc**ing **the need for expensive **inpati**ent care. Implementing NC-STeP has involved multiple hurdles including credentialing difficulties and technical/firewall challenges. The Texas model provides 24/7 availability of psychiatrists via telemedicine through a network of MHECs. In-person **staff** at the MHECs perform basic screening tests and blood draws so that medical clearance can be achieved **with**out the need for an ED visit in most cases. Funding for the MHECs comes from the state, hospitals in the region, and local governmental authorities that reap savings or benefits from the initiative. eid: 2-s2.0-84925031051
1. **Telepsychiatry Consultation for Medical and Surgical Inpatient Units**
Background Telepsychiatry is becoming more commonplace in the provision of psychiatric care. Most commonly used in the **outpati**ent setting, there is little information available in the literature as to the use of telepsychiatry for **inpati**ent medical/surgical consultation. Objective We review the University of Pittsburgh Medical **Center**'s telepsychiatry consultation program that provides consultation to an outlying community-based **rural** hospital. Methods This article examines the 69 telepsychiatry consultations that were performed from November 2014 through February 2016, looking at the patients served, common consultation questions, and patterns of diagnoses and recommendations. Results The median age of individuals undergoing telepsychiatry evaluations was 67 years, and the most common reason for consultation was for delirium. Over half of the patients consulted had a primary diagnosis of delirium, dementia, or a cognitive disorder not otherwise specified, using Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition, Text Revision) diagnoses. In most patients, additional laboratory studies or imaging or both were requested and medication changes recommended (initiation, dose changes, and discontinuation). Conclusion This report provides one of the first detailed views of the use of telepsychiatry in a rem**ote in**patient medical setting. Findings will guide education to primary teams and will shape the **develop**ment of future telepsychiatry interventions.  2018 The Academy of Psychosomatic Medicine. eid: 2-s2.0-85029228744
2. **Telepsychiatry program eases patient crowding in the ED, expedites mental health services to patients and providers.**
With funding from the Duke Endowment, the Albemarle Hospital Foundation in Elizabeth City, NC, implemented a telepsychiatry program aimed at decreasing patient backlogs in the health system's EDs, while also quickly connecting patients with **need**ed mental health care. The approach has more than halved LOS for patients who are discharged to **inpati**ent treatment facilities. The approach is also credited with reducing recidivism rates and **the **need for involuntary commitments. Now the state has announced plans to employ a similar approach statewide. Patients in the ED are connected with psychiatric providers at a remote location through the use of telemedicine carts that are equipped with wireless technology. With expedited psychiatric treatment, administrators say that nearly 30% of patients with involuntary commitment (IVC) orders stabilize to the point that their IVC orders can be rescinded and they can be discharged from the ED to **outpati**ent care. Since the start of the pilot program in March of 2011, project administrators report that the average LOS in the ED for patients discharged** to in**patient treatment facilities has decreased from 48 hours to 22.5 hours. eid: 2-s2.0-84891597657
3. **Telepsychiatry for Inpatient Consultations at a Separate Campus of an Academic Medical Center**
Background: Many hospitals do not have regular access to psychiatry consult services. This is well understood as a common shortage at nonacademic community hospitals (especially in **rural** environments, and may also be a problem at noncontiguously located smaller hospitals that are affiliated with academic medical **center**s in urban settings. The authors sought to deliver timely **inpati**ent psychiatric consultation-liaison services via telemedicine to a local but physically separated hospital affiliated with an academic medi**cal ce**nter. Materials and Methods: The authors collaborated with an office dedicated to the advancement of telemedicine technology at their academic **medica**l center. They **develop**ed a telemedicine-based care model to deli**ver in**patient consultation-liaison psychiatry consultations to an affiliated (but physically separate) small academic hospital that did not have its own on-site consultation-liaison psychiatry team. Results: The authors were able to successfully complete 30 consultations, each within 24 h. Only 1 patient was ultimately unwilling to participate in the telemedicine interview. As consultations were accomplished on same day as request, patient length of stay was unaffected. Conclusions: This pilot study suggests that telemedicine is a viable mo**del fo**r inpatient consultation-liaison psychiatry services to hospitals without on-site psychiatry resources and represents a viable alternative model of service delivery.  2016, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2016. eid: 2-s2.0-84978032635
4. **Expansion of the consultation-liaison psychiatry paradigm at a university medical center: Integration of diversified clinical and funding models**
The perspective of the contemporary Consultation-Liason Service (CLS) psychiatrist is increasingly one of consultant to medical and surgical colleagues in models other than **inpati**ent medical and surgical units. Simultaneously, the **need** for a clinically and educationally rob**ust in**patient CLS persists despite funding pressures. The University of California, Davis Medical **Center** Department of Psychiatry has made use of creative organizational and financial models to accompl**ish th**e inpatient CLS clinical and educational missions in a fiscally responsible manner. In addition, the department has in recent years expanded the delivery of psychiatry consultation-liaison clinical and educational services to other models of care delivery, broadening the role and influence of the CLS. Several of the initiatives described in this paper parallel an overall evolution of the practice of consultation-liaison psychiatry in response to managed care influences and other systems pressures. This consultation-liaison paradigm expansion with diversified sources of funding support facilitates the **develop**ment of consultation-liaison psychiatry along additional clinical, administrative, research, and educational dimensions. Other university medi**cal ce**nters may consider adaptation of some of the initiatives described here to their institutions.  2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. eid: 2-s2.0-0038013578
5. **Telepsychiatry "coverage" to a rural inpatient psychiatric unit**
Objective: **Rural** psychiatrists responsible for **inpati**ent psychiatry units in general hospitals often have trouble getting coverage for training, vacations, and periods of illness. This article describes telepsychiatry "coverage" t**o a r**ural general hospital psychiatric unit for 1 week. Materials and Methods: All adult patients meeting criteria **for in**patient mental health treatment in the emergency room were offered admission to the general hospital after obtaining informed consent regarding the** use o**f inpatient telepsychiatry. The number of pati**ents o**n the inpatient psychiatric unit ranged from three to nine, with an average daily census of seven. All psychiatric care was provided via video teleconferencing (VTC) at a bandwidth of 512 kilobits per second using Internet Protocol. Results: Patients with psychosis reported more difficulty hearing the doctor than patients without psychosis and incorporated VTC into delusions in a congruent manner. Patients rated **develop**ment of rapport and effectiveness of treatment higher than **staff** ratings. **Two s**taff thought telepsychiatry was either not effective for acutely psychotic patients or more effective with higher functioning patients. Conclusions: Short-term co**vera**ge** **of rural inpatient psychiatric units for purposes of vacation, training, and illness is possible using telepsychiatry. Psychiatrist's efficiency and consistency are enhanced with instantaneous connections possible from hospital, office, or home. Significant incre**ases **in staff workload will occur without remote access to electronic medical records, electronic physician ordering, and an adequate phy**sical **layout of the inpatient psychiatric unit. Adequate educational preparat**ion o**f unit staff regarding telep**sychi**atry and a staff process group during implementation is recommended.

6. **Impact of a telepsychiatry program at emergency departments statewide on the quality, utilization, and costs of mental health services**
Objective: This study estimated the impact of a statewide, centralized telepsychiatry service provided in nonpsychiatric emergency departments (EDs) on use of mental health services. Methods: Individuals treated via telepsychiatry were compared with a matched control group of individuals with mental health diagnoses who were treated in nonparticipating hospitals. Bivariate and two-part and generalized linear regression models were used to assess differences between the two groups in **outpati**ent follow-up, hospital admission following the ED visit, length of hospital stay if admitted, and **inpati**ent and total costs. Results: Between March 2009 and June 2013, there were 9,066 patients with at least one telepsychiatry visit. Of these, 7,261 had index telepsychiatry visits that the authors were able to successfully match. Compared with the matched control group, telepsychiatry recipients were more likely to receive 30-**day out**patient follow-up (46% versus 16%, p<.001) and** 90-day** outpatient follow-up (54% versus 20%, p<.001). Telepsychiatry recipients were less likely than the control group to be admitted to the hospital during the index ED visit (11% versus 22%, p<.00 1). The combined effect of having a telepsychiatry consult during the index ED visit was a reduction of.86 days** in in**patient length of stay. Thi**rty-da**y inpatient costs were $2,336 (p=.04) lower for the telepsychiatry versus the control group, but 30-day total health care costs were not statistically different. Conclusions: Telepsychiatry delivered in the ED through a centralized coordinated program has great promise for improving l**inkage **with outpatient mental health services whi**le red**ucing inpatient utilization and hospital costs. eid: 2-s2.0-84946557675
7. **Telepsychiatry by a Public, Academic Medical Center for Inpatient Consults at an Unaffiliated, Community Hospital**
Background: Telepsychiatry has the potential to help address the uneven distribution of psychiatrists between urban and **rural** areas. While telepsychiatry has been used for several decades, employing video conferencing technologies to conduct psychiatry consults to the medical wards** of r**ural hospitals is a more recent application. Objective: To **develop** the first US program wherein psychiatrists covering the consult service at a public, academic medical **center** also delivered same-day consults to patients on the medical wards of unaffi**liate**d, rural hospitals. Methods: We describe the rationale, workflow, technology, case distribution, benefits, and lessons learned from the first 24 months of the service. Results: The program resulted in 156 initial and follow-up consults wherein patient interviews were conducted via live videoconference. An additional 19 curbside consults were done via hospitalist-to-psychiatrist phone calls. Though the initial impetus for **the dev**elopment of the program was to manage involuntarily-detained patients awaiting the availability of a psychiatric bed, the availability of the psychiatrists resulted in the service being used for a wide range of situations and diagnoses. Conclusion: Given the benefits noted by consultants, patients, and community hospital medical **staff**, the program could be replicated by other institutions.  2018 Academy of Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry eid: 2-s2.0-85059526970
8. **Designing an academic-community telepsychiatry partnership to provide inpatient and outpatient services in a critical access hospital**
To expand access to mental health treatment in an underserved area, the University of Washington (UW) and Dayton General Hospital (DGH) entered into a partnership to provide comprehensive telepsychiatry services to individuals living in **rural** Columbia County. **Outpati**ent care is provided by behavioral health consultants at two DGH-affiliated primary care clinics in consultation with a UW-based psychiatrist with expertise in addictions. **Inpati**ent care is supported by regular consultation with UW psychiatrists as well as unscheduled "curbside" consults with attending UW psychiatrists. Patients with complex treatment options can participate in direct videoconferencing sessions with a UW psychiatrist.  2019 American Psychiatric Association.

1. **Telepresence experienced in videoconference varies according to emotions involved in videoconference sessions.**
Previous studies have linked **telepres**ence to the strength of the therapeutic relationship experienced during telepsychotherapy. This finding comes as a surprise for many people who have been involved in a teleconference meeting, wh**ere tele****presenc**e is often considered weak. The **aim** of this study is to (re)evaluate the impact of emotional engage**ment on ****telepre**sence.

This finding comes as a surprise for many people who have been involved in a teleconference meeting, wh**ere tele****presenc**e is often considered weak. The **aim** of this study is to (re)evaluate the impact of emotional engage**ment on ****telepre**sence. Participants were randomly assigned to one of the two conditions: (a) emotionally charged **verbal** exchange **first** (followed by a more neut**ral ve**rbal exchange), or (b) emotionally **neutra**l verbal excha**nge f**irst (followed by an emotiona**lly ch**arged verbal exchange). A distraction task was performed **betwee**n the two verbal exchanges in videofoncerence. **Result**s showed that verbal exchanges involving stronger emotio**ns incre****ase tel**epresence. These results **may expl****ain why** telepresence is so high in telepsychotherapy. eid: 2-s2.0-83455200034
3. **Telepsychiatry as a case study of presence: Do you know what you are missing?**
This study explores the use of **videoconfer**encing technology as a means of providing mental health consultations across distances. Analyses of 43 psychiatric interviews with 14 different patients using an interact**ive videoco**nferencing system over an 18-month period reveal that the telecommunications link compared favorably to face-to-face encounters in assessments by physicians and patients. However, telepsychiatry may hinder many of the ancillary practitioner-patient relationships that contribute to a psychiatric consultation and create a false sense of **presenc**e. The study stresses the importance of examining the new context created by implementation of any new communication technology, and of understanding the need for attention to secondary and peripheral contexts that could potentially be ignored because of **telepres**ence. eid: 2-s2.0-0012752495
4. **Factors influencing mental health providers intention to use telepsychotherapy in First Nations communities**
Telemental health is the use of information and communications technologies and broadband networks to deliver mental health services and support wellness. Although numerous studies have demonstrated the efficiency and utility of telemental health, certain barriers may impede its implementation, including the attitudes of mental health service providers. The current study draws on the technology acceptance model (TAM) to understand the role of mental health service providers attitudes and perceptions of telemental health (psychotherapy delivered via **videoconfer**encing) on their intention to use this technology with their patients. A sample of 205 broadly defined mental health service providers working on 32 **First** Nations reserves in the province of Quebec completed the questionnaire adapted to assess TAM for telepsychotherapy. Confirmatory **factor** analysis and structural equation modeling provided evidence for **the fa**ctor **valid**ity and reliability of the TAM in this sample. The key predictor of the intention to use telepsychotherapy was not mental health providers attitude toward telepsychotherapy, nor how much they expected this service to be complicated to use, but essentially how useful they expect it to be for th**eir F**irst Nations patients. If telemental health **via videoco**nferencing is to be impleme**nted **in First Nations communities, it is essential to thoroughly demonstrate its utility to mental health providers. Perceived usefulness will have a positive impact on attitudes toward this technology, and perceived ease of use will positively influence perceived usefulness. Cultural issues specific to the populations receiving telemental health services may be more efficiently addressed from the angle of perceived usefulness.  2013, SAGE Publications.

5. **Assessing presence in videoconference telepsychotherapies: A complementary qualitative study on breaks in telepresence and intersubjectivity co-construction processes**
Assessing the efficacy of online psychotherapies is an important issue in eHealth. In the present research, we used an innovative approach to focus on the characteristics of breaks in interactions that impact the acceptance of the psychotherapy setting of a telepsychotherapy delivered in **videoconfer**ence. We also tried to build a method to assess if the level of **telepres**ence in online interactions would be influenced by the acceptance of the psychotherapy setting. Sessions of psychotherapy delivered** in videoco**nference to two adults receiving CBT and two others receiving psychodynamic psychotherapy were analyzed to test the method. In this paper, we describe the methodology and illustrate preliminary results. An interactional grid was used to analyze **verbal** and **non-ve**rbal interactions, physical and social **presenc**e, and breaks in acceptance of the telepsychotherapy setting. This led to observe the interactional process of construction of enonciative** co-pre**sence, fundamental to allow people to experience intersubjectivity. This study is the **first** step towards a better understanding of the level of acceptance of the technological setting by patients and its influence on the interactions between them and psychologists.  2018, Interactive Media Institute.

Objective: Online counseling may be **defin**ed as an interaction between users and mental health professionals that takes place through computer mediated communication technology. This study aimed to investigate the attitudes of Italian psychologists towards different aspects of online counseling provided via email, chat, forums, and **videoconfer**ence. Method: An online questionnaire was administered to a sample of 289 licensed psychologists in the Veneto Region (Italy) in **order** to collect opinions, preferences, and intentions to use online modalities, along with prior knowledge and practice experiences. Results: Only 18.3% of the respondents had previous experience with online counseling. Overall, the majority of psychologists (62.6%) were favorable towards online counseling, but they also had several reservations about the **provis**ion of online diagnosis and therapeutic interventions. Results showed a consistent **lack** of clarity regarding **ethic**al and penal issues concerning online modalities. Conclusions: More efforts must be directed to deepening the application of new technologies in the **field** of psychology** in o**rder to enable** an e**thical and professional practice of online counseling in Italy.  2017,  2017 Society for Psychotherapy Research. eid: 2-s2.0-85009200750
1. **Ethical Practice in Telepsychology**
Objective: Telepsychology has the potential to revolutionise the **provis**ion of psychological service not only to those in remote locations, or with mobility issues, but also for those who prefer flexible access to services. Rapid developments in internet communications technology have yielded new and diverse methods of telepsychology. As a result, **ethic**al regulatory and advisory guidelines for practice have often been developed and disseminated reactively. This article investigates how the c**ore e**thical principles of **confidenti**ally, consent and competence are challenged in telepsychological practice. Method: Through the application of e**xisti**ng ethical standards, advances in communications technology are considere**d and** their ethical use in psychological **context**s explored. Conclusion: It is expected that psychologists will have basic competencies for the use of everyday technology in their practice. However, the use of internet communications technology for telepsychology has created new opportunities and** chal**lenges for ethical practice. For example, telepsychology is geographically flexible, but there can be privacy concerns in cross-b**order** information flow. Psychologists who engage in telepsychology require a particularly thorough understanding of concepts such as data mining, electronic storage, and internet infrastructure. This article highlights how existing technology and communication tools both ch**allen**ge and support ethical practice in telepsychology in an Australian regulat**ory con**text.  2015 The Australian Psychological Society. eid: 2-s2.0-84937575706
2. **Twenty-First Century Ethical Challenges for Psychology**
Foreseeable social and technological changes will force us to reevaluate our thinking about **ethic**ally appropriate ways to fulfill our mission of using psychology to advance human health and welfare in the twenty-first century. Three categories of challenge related to societal and technological changes have become particularly evident. First, increasing patterns of delivering services over substantial distances by electronic means (i.e., telepsychology) demand consideration. Second, we must parse **our e**thical obligations to individuals, to groups, and to society at large as our influence working behind the scenes as "invisible" psychologists grows. Finally, as we witness the accelerating demise of psychiatry, we must take care not to follow a similar path. As we f**ace n**ew ethical challenges, we must continually ask ourselves where our responsibilities lie as individuals and as a profession. We must learn not to repeat the mistakes of the past and focus instead on optimizing the future for a science and practice of psychology focused on human health and welfare.  2007 American Psychological Association. eid: 2-s2.0-34548642366
3. **Telepsychology and video-interview [Tlpsychologie et visioconsultation]**
Telepsychology is an emerging **field** in present psychotherapeutic practices. There are different methods available to carry out psychotherapy at a distance. These methods more or less involve the participant's bodies. **Videoconfer**ence is a technology that permits to users to see each other. This has an influence on interactions established at a distance. Video-interview is a method based on the adaptation online of the classical clinical face-to-face interview framework. Objectives: 1. Adapt the clinical interview framework online. Conceptualize a prototype device: http://www.ipsy.fr. 2. Compare the relationship between a patient and a psychologist during a face-to-face interview in a classical framework and on the online platform. Materials and methods: The sample of our study was composed of two groups of four participants. Participants were adults and did not have alterated relationship to reality. We compared the video-interviews realized with two groups of participants: one previously handled in a traditional framework and the other solely met through the platform. We used a qualitative method to analyze video-interviews recordings: a 12 items theme based grid. We were very attentive to **ethic**al rules and data security all along the platform development process and after that in the use of the device. Results: Psychological processes activated in the **context** of video-interview are similar to those observed in traditional clinical consults, for both groups of participants. These results also show the tierce function of the device in the dual relationship between the patient and the clinical psychologist. These results open a reflexion on the process relative to the creation of an intersubjective relationship in telepsychotherapy. It seems that the study of the sense of presence might be useful to understand intersubjectivity in telepsychotherapy and more generally in digital relationships. Conclusions: A methodological work is still necessary to **defin**e telepsychotherapy. This work should include** an e**thical dimension, in **order** to preserve online users safety. Telepsychotherapy has many advantages, for example, it permits a better access to psychotherapy for isolated people. These people can be isolated geographically, or they might have mobility issues, or even psychological issues making it difficult for them to go in the psychologist office. Present boundaries are technical, but also methodological, with the **lack**** of d**efinitio**n of **an ethical and methodological framework of telepsychotherapy in France. We also notice **the **lack of longitudinal, quantitative and qualitative data on evaluation of telepsychotherapies efficacity. Also, some fundamental data should be explored theoretically, as the sense of presence.  2018 Elsevier Masson SAS eid: 2-s2.0-85042157143

0. **Thinking Outside the Box: Are We Ready for Teleprecepting to Expand Training and Practice Venues?**
A significant challenge related to nurse practitioner (NP) training is the shortage of clinical sites with qualified faculty to precept NP interns. The problem is compounded in **rural** communities with provider shortages, restricting their opportunities to train (and potentially recruit) new APRNs. Consequently, these **underserv**ed communities have difficulty accessing specialty providers, such as Psychiatric Mental Health Nurse Practitioners (PMHNPs). Combined with geographic distance from urban communities and generally lower pay, m**any r**ural and/or **remot**e communities struggle with the disparity in contrast to more populated regions. A needs assessment of** an under**served county with poor access to psychiatric services suggests that contracted telepsychiatry was costly and failed to address the long-term dearth of local psychiatric providers. Stakeholders reported that local RNs (and possibly FNPs) were employed by the local hospital and that a subgroup may have aptitude and interest in psychiatry if a **univers**ity program and preceptors were available. Collaborating with an urban PMHNP program, televideo technology for clinical training and preceptor **develop**ment offers a solution to the dearth of preceptors. A pilot intervention will use teleprecepting aimed at establishing best practice guidelines for implementation of this novel approach to expanding the clinical training and capa**city **in rural and under-served communities.  2019,  2**019 Uni**versity of California San Francisco. eid: 2-s2.0-85055985260
1. **Rural mental health service utilization in a Texas telepsychology clinic**
Objective: To determine if service utilization behaviors varied with the **remot**eness of clients served by a telepsychology clinic in a predominantly **rural** health professional shortage area (HPSA) in Texas. Methods: Archival data from 290 low-income clients were analyzed to test associations between service utilization behaviors and clients distance from the nearby access points where they traveled to receive counseling services f**rom r**emotely located counselors. Results: Distance to access points did not predict differences in service utilization behaviors. However, clients** in r**ural counties traveled farther to receive services than clients in metropolitan areas. Some utilization behaviors varied by demographic variables and depressive symptom severity. Conclusions: A hub and spoke model of telehealth service delivery is an acceptable model for improving access to mental health care serv**ices **in rural and **underserv**ed communities, even for clients who live relatively far from access points. Telehealth providers should consider geographic, socioeconomic, transportation, and health-related barriers to care experienced by clients when implementing services and policies.  2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-85076372133
2. **Characteristics of patients seen by visiting psychiatrists through Medicare in a rural community mental health service with an established telemedicine service**
Objective: We aimed to determine characteristics of patients receiving Medicare-funded face-to-face consultations by psychiatrists in a **rural** service with an established telemedicine service. Methods: For this study, 55 case-managed patients from f**our r**ural community mental health teams in South Australia provided information through questionnaires regarding psychological symptoms, quality of life, body mass index (BMI) and gave access to their Medicare data. Results: In a logistic regression, it was found that being younger was more likely associated with a Medicare psychiatric consultation (p<0.05). Participants with at least one recorded visit to a Medicare psychiatrist consultation also tended to have lower levels of psychological distress at the end of the 4-year period, have a higher BMI, and more general practitioner consultations. Conclusion: The study provides clinicians and policy makers with preliminary information on the subtle differences in clinical profile of patients seen by Medicare-funded psychiatrists within an established state-managed telepsychiatry service.

3. **The Alabama coalition for a healthier black belt: A proof of concept project**
The Alabama Coalition for a Healthier Black was a demonstration of concept **project**. This paper is a descriptive and qualitative overview of this 2.5 y**ear pro**ject. Limi**ted key** project results are reported here. Located in the **rural** Black Belt region of Alabama this coalition had several key aims: to **develop** a collaboration between primary care and mental health care through co-location of services; use of video-conferencing capability to provide **mental health servic**es more efficiently; enhanced training** in r**ural healthcare; **and dev**elopment of stigma reduction campaigns along with other coalition partner specific initiatives. Co-location and telepsychiatry implementation produced the major challenges and resulting adaptations to original aims.

4. **Training psychiatrists for rural practice: A 20-year follow-up**
Objective: This report describes the **Rural** Psychiatry Residency Program at the **Univers**ity of New Mexico (UNM RPRP) and presents findings from a survey of program graduates. Methods: Current practice location of residency graduates was identified to learn whether graduates of the UNM RPRP continued to practice** in r**ural communities compared to the graduates of the traditional residency program. Additionally, a web-based survey was completed by 37 of the 60 graduates who participated in the UNM RPRP since its inception in 1991 through 2010. Questions addressed current practice, perceived barriers, and perceptions of experiences. Results: Thirty-seven percent of the graduates from the UNM RPRP currently prac**tice **in rural communities compared to 10 % of the graduates from the traditional residency track. Of the survey respondents, 95 % continue to work with **underserv**ed individuals. Reported barriers to **pract**ice in rural areas include professional isolation, lack of referral resources, and travel distances. Respondents reported valuing education about systems based practice and telepsychiatry. Conclusion: Purposeful and well-coordinated educational opportunit**ies s**ituated in rural community health clinics can address some of the barriers for recruiting and retaining practici**ng ps**ychiatrists in rural areas. Practical skill building at the individual, agency, and system level is integral in training psychiatrists for work in these communities. In particular, the use of telepsychiatry emerged as an important practical applicati**on fo**r the provision of rural mental health care.  2014 Academic Psychiatry. eid: 2-s2.0-84907187036
5. **Videoconference Grief Group Counseling in Rural Texas: Outcomes, Challenges, and Lessons Learned**
Disparities in access to mental health care, especially in **rural** areas, demand continued attention from practitioners, researchers, and community stakeholders. Telehealth, or the use of long distance technology to provide **mental health servic**es, is one well-recognized solution for reducing mental health disparities. At the Telehealth Counseling Clinic, advanced doctoral students provide telepsychology services to low-income and uninsured individuals living i**n a r**ural region in Texas. In response to an identified community need for grief counseling services, an 8-week grief group utilizing videoconference technology was conducted. This article discusses clinical and methodological challenges and lessons learned that are unique to delivering group counseling services over videoconference technolo**gy in** a rural area, as well as preliminary data of the groups effectiveness as measured by a satisfaction survey, the Patient Health Questionnaire9, the COREB, and the Complicated Grief Assessment are presented.  2016 ASGW. eid: 2-s2.0-84961206491
6. **The use of videoconferencing for mental health services in Finland**
The utilization of telemental health (TMH) services in Finland was surveyed in 2006. In total, 135 health-care units provided responses. Eighty-four responses were received from primary care units (health-care centres and clinics) and eight from other clinics, in all hospital districts. The overall rate of TMH consultations was 4 per 100,000 population. The highest TMH consultation per population ratio, 22 per 100,000, was in northern Finland. Most of the sites used telepsychiatry services for less than 10% of clinical outpatient services. The sites with over 20% utilization of clinical TMH services from all psychiatric consultations were all **rural** health centres. Compared with Finland, the utilization rates of TMH were higher in Canada; that might be due to differences between the countries in the organization of **mental health servic**es in primary and specialized care. In Finland TMH consultations made up only a very small proportion of **all mental health se**rvices. The use of TMH was particularly common in **remot**e areas; however, there were m**any r**ural centres that did not utilize clinical TMH. TMH was widely utilized for continuing and medical education. eid: 2-s2.0-64549119793
7. **Health-related quality of life of rural clients seeking telepsychology services**
Sixty million US residents live in **rural** areas, but health policies and interventions **develop**ed from an urban mindset often fail to address the significant barriers to health experienced by these local communities. Telepsychology, or psychological services delivered by distance via technology, is an emerging treatment modality with special implications for underser**ved r**ural areas. This study found that a sa**mple **of rural residents seeking telepsychology services (n = 94) had low health-related quality of life (HRQOL), often due to cooccurring physical and mental health diagnoses including high rates of depression. However, a brief telepsychology treatment d**elive**red to rural clients (n = 40) was associated with an improvement in mental health-related quality of life (d = 0.70, P <.001). These results indicate that despite the complex health needs of these **underserv**ed communities, telepsychology interventions may help offset the disparities in health se**rvice** access in rural areas.  2014 Kevin R.

8. **Developing Telemental Health Partnerships Between State Medical Schools and Federally Qualified Health Centers: Navigating the Regulatory Landscape and Policy Recommendations**
Background: Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) deliver care to 26 million Americans living in **underserv**ed areas, but few offer telemental health (TMH) services. The social missions of FQHCs and publicly funded state medical schools create a compelling argument for the **develop**ment of TMH partnerships. In this paper, we share our experience and recommendations from launching TMH partnerships between 12 **rural** FQHCs and 3 state medical schools. Experience: There was consensus that medical school TMH providers should practice as part of the FQHC team to promote integration, enhance quality and safety, and ensure financial sustainability. For TMH providers to practice and bill as FQHC providers, the following issues must be addressed: (1) credentialing and privileging the TMH providers at the FQHC, (2) expanding FQHC Scope of **Project** to include telepsychiatry, (3) **remot**e access to medical records, (4) insurance credentialing/paneling, billing, and supplemental payments, (5) contracting with the medical school, and (6) indemnity coverage for TMH. Recommendations: We make recommendations to both state medical schools and FQHCs about how to overcome existing barriers to TMH partnerships. We also make recommendations about changes to policy that would mitigate the impact of these barriers. Specifically, we make recommendations to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid about insurance credentialing, facility fees, eligibility of TMH encounters for supplemental payments, and Medicare eligibility rules for TMH billing by FQHCs. We also make recommendations to the Health Resources and Services Administration about restrictions on adding telepsychiatry to the FQHCs Scope** of Pro**ject and the eligibility of TMH providers for indemnity coverage under the Federal Tort Claims Act.  2018 The Authors.

There is a significant shortage of clinical psychology services in **rural** and **remot**e Australia. It is proposed that tele-web psychology may provide one potential solution to this inequity in health provision. A tele-web psychology **project** was **develop**ed through a partnership between a **univers**ity and country health service setting** in r**ural South Australia. Tele-web psychology was conducted by Provisional Psychologists on their first clinical placement, with patients attending sessions in a community mental health team hub in a regional centre north of Adelaide.

The purpose of this paper is to describe the partnership between a community-based **rural** mental health clinic and an academic health center to provide telepsychiatry services** in r**ural Alabama. The partnership was **develop**ed to meet the needs of a clinic that serves an unde**rserv**ed **rural popul**ation with limited psychiatric services. This paper offers valuable lessons learned for mental health practitioners who may be considering the benefits and challenges of forming community-based partnerships in use of telepsychiatry to build capacity to deliver clinical mental health **servi**ces to rural mental health shortage areas.  2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC. eid: 2-s2.0-84872603652
11. **Estimating the economic impact of telemedicine in a rural community**
One commonly discussed benefit of broadband access in **rural** America is the potential for telemedicine visits that al**low r**ural residents to take advantage of urbanized medical services. While the primary benefit of telemedicine is often viewed as improved health care access, the availability of these services also offers significant economic contributions to the local community. Site visit**s to **24 rural hospitals of varying size over a four-state area in the Midwest provide information to **develop** a methodology for estimating telemedicine's economic impact. Using this technique, telemedicine services contribute between $20,000 and $1.3M annually to these local economies, with an average of $522,000.  2011 Northeastern Agricultural and Resource Economics Association. eid: 2-s2.0-83455225285
12. **A pilot project to improve access to Telepsychotherapy at rural clinics**
Background: The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has pioneered telemental health (TMH) with over 500,000 TMH encounters over the past decade. VA community-based outpatient clinics were established to improve accessibility of mental healthcare for **rural** Veterans. Despite these clinics clinics and increased availability of TMH, m**any r**ural Veterans have difficulty receiving mental healthcare, particularly psychotherapy. Materials and Methods: Twelve therapists participated in a pilot **project** using TMH technologies to improve mental healthcare service deli**very **to rural Veterans treated at six community clinics. Therapists completed online training, and study staff communicated with them monthly and clinical leaders every other month. Therapists completed two questionnaires: before training and 10 months later. This article describes barriers and facilitators to the implementation of **the pro**ject, as well as therapists' knowledge, confidence, and motivation regarding TMH. Results: Two clinicians were offering telepsychotherapy after 10 months. At all six sites, unanticipated organizational constraints and administrative barriers delayed implementation; establishing organizational practices and therapists' motivation helped facilitate the process. Adopters** of the** project reported more positive views of the modality and did not worry about staffing, a concern of nonadopters. Conclusions: Despite barriers to implementation, lessons learned from** this p**ilot project have led to improvements and changes in TMH processes. Results from the pilot showed that therapists providing telepsychotherapy had increased confidence, knowledge, and motivation. As TMH continues to expand, formalized decision-making with clinical le**aders r**egarding project goals, better matching of therapists with this modality, and assessment of medical center and clinic readiness are recommended.  2014, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-84891592314
13. **Telepsychology in Australia: 2020 vision**
The current roll-out of broadband across Australia provides new opportunities for psychologists to reach out to residents in **remot**e and **rural** areas. With the advent of internet protocol (IP)-based videoconferencing, telepsychology is becoming more accessible and affordable, and a potential solution to those** in r**emote areas who require access to specialist assessment and psychotherapy services. Telepsychology represents a high-quality/low-cost model of service delivery. Findings to date suggest that outcome might be equivalent to in-person therapy across a range of client groups both using standardised assessments and evidence-based therapies. Studies have consistently shown that clients rate high levels of satisfaction and therapeutic rapport. However, uptake among psychologists has been slow. This article provides a synthesis of the gradual growth of telepsychology in Australia. It identifies factors that hinder the **develop**ment of telepsychology and outlines the main arguments **for dev**eloping this as a model for the provision of psychology** acro**ss remote **and r**ural Australia. The authors draw on their own recent experie**nces in** developing collaborative telepsychology services to make recommendations for the future of telepsychology in Australia.  2014 N**ation**al Rural Health Alliance Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-84916209260
14. **A telepsychiatry model to support psychiatric outreach in the public sector in South Africa**
The access of **rural** Mental Health Care Users in South Africa to specialist psychiatrists and quality mental health care is currently sub-optimal. Health professionals and planners working in psychiatry lack a well-defined and feasible outreach model to facilitate the delivery of services to **remot**e **and r**ural areas. In response to this challenge, a three-year action research telepsychiatry study was undertaken by the Departments of Psychiatry and TeleHealth at the **Univers**ity of KwaZulu-Natal, to **develop** a telepsychiatry outreach model based on local research and international evidence. The Model draws on needs and infrastructure assessments of the designated psychiatric hospitals in the province, a review of the published international evidence on telepsychiatry and videoconference-based education, and an evaluation of local clinical and educational telepsychiatry implementations in KwaZulu-Natal. The Model proposed is "virtual", i.e. not bound to provincial or district referral patterns, aims not to add to the burden on the current workforce and is intended to be integrated into psychiatry outreach services and policy. The Model should be subjected to in situ testing for validation and implementation. It is hoped that an implementation of this Model will improve the access of Mental Health Care Users to specialist psychiatry care. eid: 2-s2.0-84870978861
15. **Enhancing access to psychologically informed mental health services in rural and northern communities**
Access to psychologically informed **mental health servic**es has historically been a challenge for the more than 6 million Canadians residing in **rural** and northern (R&N) communities. However, over the past 20 years, Canada has been witness to a number of positive psychologist-led initiatives aimed at enhancing access for R&N Canadians. These can be grouped into 2 main categories, namely recruiting and retaining psychologists in R&N communities and **develop**ing and implementing technologically supported psychology services offered at a distance (telepsychology). This article provides an overview of the barriers to accessing psychologically infor**med mental health se**rvices and reviews some of the psychologist-led initiatives aimed at enhancing access in R&N Canada. Potential benefits and limitations of these initiatives are presented and the importance of enhanced collaboration between urban and R&N-based psychologists is discussed. Finally, psychologists are encouraged to look for and embrace opportunities to further broaden and enhance their positive presence in R&N communities.  2013 Canadian Psychological Association. eid: 2-s2.0-84878331449
16. **Counseling center-based tele-mental health for students at a rural university**
Students attending **rural** academic institutions often have no immediate access to psychiatrists to supplement on-site Counseling Center (CC) services. Because the Medical College of Georgia (MCG) could not cost-effectively provide on-site psychiatry services to Georgia Southern **Univers**ity (GSU) students, the two institutions explored telehealth services delivered by supervised Psychiatry residents using Web-based videoconferencing on MCG's virtual private network. GSU counselors completed client severity rating forms. CC clients in ongoing therapy who were judged to be in need of psychiatric services were referred to the Tele-clinic (TC). CC counselors referred the most challenged students to TC according to total distress score on intake, clinician intake assessment of client difficulty, and client need for medications. After seeing the clients in TC, MCG residents also completed GSU CC client severity rating forms. Post-intake and satisfaction surveys already in use at the GSU CC were completed both by CC clients not in TC and by CC clients jointly enrolled in TC. TC and CC populations were compared by gender, race, past mental health treatment, past psychiatric hospitalization, and past and current use of psychotropic drugs. Telepsychiatry conducted using low bandwidth videoconferencing successfully supplemented GSU CC mental healthcare, especially for clients with the most serious problems, and did so without travel from campus and within the milieu of daily student life. Cost-effective telepsychiatry services can successfully supplement management of students with mental health issues who att**end r**ural, smaller, and/or resource-challenged academic institutions.

17. **Continuing professional development for Australian rural psychiatrists by videoconference**
Objective: The **Rural** Special Interest Group (RSIG) of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists provided a program of educational meetings for psychiatrists and trainees** in r**ural locations to decrease professional isolation and facilitate opportunities to obtain credit for continuing professional **develop**ment (CPD) purposes in ongoing professional registration. A pilot peer review group by videoconference was also implemented in Western Australia, to provide peer review for psychiatrists working in isolation. Method: Six national interactive videoconferenced education seminars were provided. The membership was polled prior to the program for topic preferences and requested speakers, who were subsequently approached to present the seminars. A West Australian peer review group was formed, involving psychiatrists from five di**ffere**nt rural locations and one psychiatrist from the metropolitan area. Results: National seminars were attended by 106 individuals (67% consultant psychiatrists, 17% trainees and 16% allied health professionals). Evaluation demonstrates favourable views of the content and quality of the presentations and impact on practice patterns. Conclusions: Attendance at seminars via videoconferenci**ng pr**ovided rural psychiatrists with opportunities to obtain CPD credit without the need to travel, providing a cost-effective alternative for accessing education. Involvement enabled interaction among peers throughout Australia, alleviating professional isolation and generating networking opportunities. The West Australian peer review group demonstrated sustainability with a commitment to continuation and positive impact on practice. eid: 2-s2.0-48749111372

The VA Puget Sound Health Care System Telemental Health program connects veterans with psychologists, psychiatrists, and social workers via live clinical video teleconferencing. Providers deliver care to veterans in **rural** Veteran Affairs medical centers, community-based outpatient clinics and residences, and thus, increase access to specialty mental health care **for r**ural and medically **underserv**ed veteran communities. eid: 2-s2.0-84864759331
19. **The fall and rise of the South Australian telepsychiatry network**
The **Rural** and **Remot**e **Mental Health Servic**e (RRMHS) has delivered telepsychiatry services through the use of videoconferencing to South Australian communities since May 1994. The survivability of the service results from a combination of factors that have seen the RRMHS expand to 48 centres and deliver an average of 100 clinical sessions a month. The key factors responsible for the success of the service lie in the model of service delivery, management support, and the implementation of a system for the scheduling and reporting of videoconference activity. The current model of service delivery has evolved over the past seven years and is fundamentally different to the infrastructure established at the implementation stage of the **project**. A retrospective analysis shows the shift in service delivery models necessary for the sustainability of telepsychiatry services in South Australia. eid: 2-s2.0-0042762614
20. **Telepsychiatry for neurocognitive testing in older rural latino adults**
As the population of older Latinos in the U.S. increases, availability of culturally adapted geriatric psychiatry services is becoming a growing concern. This issue is exacerbated for **rural** Latino populations. In this study, we assessed whether neuro-cognitive assessment via telepsychiatry (TP) using a Spanish-language battery would be comparable to in-person (IP) testing using the same battery in a sample of Spanish-speaking older adults i**n a r**ural setting. Patients (N = 22) received IP and TP testing 2 weeks apart. The order of IP and TP test administrations in individual subjects was determined randomly. Comparison of scores indicated that there were no significant differences between IP and TP test performance though both groups scored non-significantly higher at the second visit. This study demonstrates feasibility and utility of neurocognitive testing in Spanish using TP amon**g old**er rural Latinos.  2015 American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry. eid: 2-s2.0-84942746515
21. **Rural mental health: Implications for telepsychiatry in clinical service, workforce development, and organizational capacity**
In Hawai'i, **rural** residents suffer disproportionately from poor health and mental health outcomes. Hawai'i's island geography ma**kes r**ural health service disparities especially compelling. Physician workforce shortages are **project**ed to increase, despite 30 years of programs aimed at recruiting physic**ians **to rural areas. Telepsychiatry has been shown to be a feasible way to provide a variety of health services to individual**s liv**ing in rural areas with limited access to healthcare. The Univer**sity **of Hawai'i Rural Health Collaboration (UHRHC) was established by the Department of Psychiatry to address the need for workfo**rce d**evelopment and rural access to **mental health servic**es across the State of Hawai'i by using telepsychiatry. Partnerships with community health clinics have been formed to provide patient care and consultation-liaison services through telepsychiatry technology. In addition, UHRHC focuses on workforce **develop**ment in its residency training curriculum by utilizing a servi**ce-le**arning approach to rural mental health. Evaluation of these efforts is currently underway, with preliminary evidence suggesting that UHRHC is a promising strategy to increase access to criti**cal mental health se**rvices and r**educe** health disparities in rural Hawai'i.

22. **An evaluation of the telepsychiatry programme in Victoria, Australia**
We evaluated the use of telepsychiatry in Victoria, a state of Australia with some five million people. There were 39 sites at the time of the survey, 12 metropolitan and 27 **rural**. Interviews and postal questionnaires were used. A total of 99 staff were surveyed, 69 by post and 30 during visits. There were 37 participants from metropolitan sites and 62 f**rom r**ural** site**s. Rural sites conducted an estimated 137 sessions per month (i.e. an average of 5.1 per month per site). The majority (70%) of the usage in Victoria was for clinical purposes, both primary and secondary consultations. eid: 2-s2.0-0033654611
23. **Have communication technologies influenced rural social work practice?**
Recent advances in communication technologies have the capacity for addressing many of the challenges identified with **rural** and **remot**e social work practice, such as scarcity of professional resources, professional isolation and limited access to supervision and professional **develop**ment. The purpose of this exploratory, qualitative study was to examine **how dev**elopments in communication technologies have influenced the way social workers practise social work** in r**ural **and r**emote Canadian areas. In-depth interviews were conducted with thirty-seven clinicians. The findings suggested that having access to communication resources, such as the internet, Telehealth and Telepsychiatry, appears to be positively addressing some is**sues **of rural and northern practice. While the role of communication technologies could be **further** developed as a means of addressing some of the limitations of distance and fewer professional resources in these areas, it simultaneously risks imposing an urban-centric bias upon social work **pract**ice in ru**ral a**nd remote communities. eid: 2-s2.0-77949297975
24. **Use of telepsychiatry to improve care for people with mental illness in rural North Carolina.**
Telehealth improves access to medical services, especially for people living in **rural** areas. In North Carolina, the advantages of telepsychiatry also go beyond improving access.

25. **Telepsychiatry program for rural victims of domestic violence**
Domestic violence is a significant public health problem and is correlated with serious mental and physical disorders. Victims' fear and isolation seriously limit access to psychiatric evaluation and treatment. Telemedicine provides a means to overcome these obstacles. This article describes a telemedicine program that provides psychiatric screening, evaluation, treatment, and referral for ongoing care to clients of a **rural** women's crisis center. Psychiatric evaluation and treatment were provided t**o a r**ural women's shelter program using telepsychiatry. The shelter program had difficulty accessing traditional mental health, service. All new clients entering the program were screened for mental health problems. Those requiring further evaluation received a physical examination with medical history and initial psychological interview on site, followed by psychiatric evaluation by videoconference. Appropriate treatment was initiated, and referral for ongoing psychiatric care through the local community mental health clinic was arranged. Of the 38 women referred for **mental health servic**es by clinic staff, 35 completed a psychiatric evaluation using telepsychiatry and 31 entered treatment. The most commonly identified disorders were anxiety and major affective disorders, followed by substance use disorders. Telepsychiatry can provide rapid crisis intervention and effect**ive mental health se**rvices to victims of domestic violen**ce in** a rural setting.  Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-27744481939
26. **Rural jail telepsychiatry: A pilot feasibility study**
New York State has a large **rural** population, and many of the jails** in r**ural areas have minimal or no psychiatric services available on site. Cost of transport to off-site psychiatric services and the safety issues related to moving inmates from a secure building may limit inmate access to appropriate psychiatric services. This feasibility study describes a **project** that provided telepsychiatric consultation to increase access to psychiatric treatment in an unde**rserv**ed rural jail in upstate New York. Subjects were consenting jail inmates who requested or were found to be in need of psychiatric care. **The pro**ject provided interactive two-way audio-video communication between the psychiatrist located in an urban **univers**ity medical center and subjects who were incarcerated 182 miles away. Dur**ing the** project period, 15 inmates were assessed and treated in 37 consultations. Subjects were predominantly young white males with anxiety, mood, and substance use disorders. Services were readily accepted by inmates and staff. Telepsychiatric examination and treatment appears to be a feasible method to increase access to mental hea**lth c**are in rural jails. Future advocacy for increased mental hea**lth s**ervices in rural areas in criminal justice setting is likely to depend on further evidence of favorable cost benefit.

27. **A community-based approach to evaluation of health outcomes and costs for telepsychiatry in a rural population: Preliminary results**
A pilot trial was established to support visiting psychiatric services and local public and private practitioners through the use of videoconferencing. The purpose of the trial was to determine whether people in the community received better health-care with telemedicine. A community-based approach was used to evaluate health outcomes, costs, utilization, accessibility, quality and needs for such services in a **rural** community in Queensland. Over a two-year period data were collected from 124 subjects who met the criteria of having a mental health problem or mental disorder. Nine further subjects refused to participate in the study. Only 32 subjects used videoconferencing to receive **mental health servic**es. Preliminary results did not show any significant improvements in wellbeing or quality of life, although the time span was relatively short. However, the results confirmed that the people were no worse off from a consumer or a practitioner perspective from using videoconferencing. Most consumers found that videoconferencing with a psychiatrist moderately or greatly helped them in managing their treatment, with 98% of them preferring to be offered videoconferencing in combination with local services. Overall, videoconferencing is a crucial part of enhancing psychiatry services** in r**ural areas. However, it is not necessarily cost-effective for all consumers, general practitioners, psychiatrists, or the pub**lic mental health se**rvice. eid: 2-s2.0-0000541859
28. **Rural versus suburban primary care needs, utilization, and satisfaction with telepsychiatric consultation**
Context and Purpose: **Rural** and suburban populations remain **underserv**ed in terms of psychiatric services but have not been compared directly in terms of using telepsychiatry. Methods: Patient demographics, reasons for consultation, diagnosis, and alternatives to telepsychiatric consultation were collected for 200 consecutive, first-time telepsychiatric consultations** at r**ural and suburban clinics. Fi**nding**s: Rural patients were more likely than suburban patients to be younger than 18 years, using Medicaid, and needing treatment planning (lest they be referred out of the **commu**nity). Rural patient and primary care physician satisfaction was higher than that of suburban counterparts. Conclusion: Telepsychiatry programs may enhance access, satisfaction,** and **quality of rural c**are. ** 2007 National Rural Health Association. eid: 2-s2.0-33947674116
29. **Acceptability of telepsychiatry to a rural population**
Sixty-seven residents of a **rural** Midwestern state were surveyed by telephone to determine which factors influence their willingness to receive **mental health servic**es through live, two-way audio and video transmission. Two-thirds of the survey respondents were willing to participate in telepsychiatry. Many expressed reluctance, however. They were concerned about maintaining confidentiality, and they perceived telepsychiatry as impersonal. Medicare enrollees and older survey respondents were less willing than younger respondents to endorse the use of telemedicine. eid: 2-s2.0-0034117365
30. **Telepsychiatry in South Australia**
Telemedicine has evolved to become an integral part of the South Australian **Rural** and **Remot**e **Mental Health Servic**e. The resulting telemedicine service is one of only a few telepsychiatry services around the world that is firmly embedded in normal clinical practice and can be regarded as sustainable. The telepsychiatry service has been operational in Adelaide since January 1994 and more than 2000 clinical consultations have been performed since that time. In contrast to other telepsychiatry systems internationally, more than 80% of the usage of the South Australian system has been for clinical purposes. The benefits and limitations of telepsychiatry are reviewed, as are factors that have affected the success of the **project**. eid: 2-s2.0-0032240735
31. **Attitudes toward medical and mental health care delivered via telehealth applications among rural and urban primary care patients**
Adequate health care services are often not available in **rural** and **remot**e areas, and this problem is expected to grow worse in the near future. "Telehealth" interventions represent a strategy for addressing access to care problems. We examined and compared attitudes toward medical and mental health care delivered via telehealth applications among ad**ult r**ural (n = 112) and urban (n = 78) primary care patients. We also examined attitudes toward telehealth applications among a subset of patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-a group likely in need of specialized services. Both ur**ban a**nd rural patients were receptive to receiving medical and psychiatric services via telehealth. There were few meaningful differences across variables betwee**n urb**an and rural patients, and there were no meaningful differences by PTSD status. These findings support the feasibility of telehealth applications, p**artic**ularly for rural patients who may not otherwise receive needed services.  2008 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-39149100645

Challenges in collecting comprehensive health surveillance data on people with intellectual and **develop**mental disabilities (IDD) are numerous. A number of important issues and strategies are discussed in the articles contained in this special issue of Intellectual **and Dev**elopmental Disabilities. In this article, we focus on the advances and tools available in the area of technology. We explore a number of possible sources including accessing big data such as analyzing health information contained in Medicaid and Medicare health databases. We also discuss some of the possibilities afforded to us by complementing Medicaid/Medicare database information with health information available in the myriad of electronic health records. Lastly, we explore other technologies available that might yield valuable health supports and information, including wearable devices, **remot**e supports and other smart home technologies, telehealth and telepsychiatry, as well as looking at ways to access other technologies that collect health information (e.g., glucometer, health apps, connected exercise devices, etc.). eid: 2-s2.0-85072759544

Telemedicine, or the use of telecommunication technologies for the delivery of medical services, has been receiving increasing attention as a possible answer to the tyranny of distance and the scarcity of specialist resources in **rural** and **remot**e Australia [1,2]. While internationally teleradiology and teledermatology are the most frequent users of the technology, in Australia it is psychiatry that has been quick to recognise the potential of telemedicine and to use it for the delivery of specialist psychiatric support. In Australia telepsychiatry is one of the most common forms of telemedicine with some of the most established and successful tele-psychiatry programmes in the world.  1997, The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists.

Objective: The focus of the present study was to investigate levels of psychological distress and **therapeut**ic **allianc**e rated by **client**s attending psychological therapy **session**s via video therapy or in **person** at a university psychology-training clinic. Method: Participants were** 23 cl**ients who had completed at least five ther**apy ses**sions with a provisional psychologist on placement in a university psychology clinic. Six of these a**ttended** sessions via **videoconfer**encing in Port Augusta and 17 wer**e loca**l clients who attended traditiona**l in-pe**rson sessions. Both qualitative and quantitative methods were utilised in order to identify perceptions of and reactions to video therapy as described by participants. Results: Reported levels of psychological **distres**s across sessions were within the clinical range and similar across both video therapy and** in-pe**rson settings, with no statistical differences between the groups. Equally high levels** of thera**peu**tic all**iance were established across both settings. Participants' experiences of video therapy were further explored under five main themes identified through content analysis: Initial Reactions and Adjustments, Factors Affecting Communication, Perceived Effecti**veness, T**her**apeutic** Alliance, and Practical Factors. Conclusions: Findings suggest video therapy provided by provisional psychologists represents a feasible and acceptable means by which **rural** residents can access psychological treatments in the Australian context.  2015 The Australian Psychological Society. eid: 2-s2.0-84937563033
1. **The effects of telepsychology format on empathic accuracy and the therapeutic alliance: An analogue counselling session**
Objective: The primary purpose of this study was to evaluate whether psychotherapy format (**videoconfer**encing, telephone or in-**person**) influenced **therapist** empathic accuracy and **client**s perceptions of the **therapeut**ic **allianc**e. We also evaluated whet**her cl**ient attitudes towards using telepsychology influenced **the thera**peu**tic all**iance in the telepsychology formats. A secondary purpose was to determine whether empathic accuracy predic**ted the t**her**apeutic** alliance differently across service delivery formats. Method: A randomised block design was used to assign vo**luntee**r clients (N=58) to receive one **session** of psychotherapy i**n a videoco**nferencing, telephonic or in-per**son fo**rmat. Clients co**mpleted t**wo **therape**utic alliance measures and a telepsychology attitudes measure, and b**oth t**hera****pists and clients completed an empathic accuracy measure. Results: There were no statistically significant differences between the condit**ions on t**herapist empat**hic accur**acy** or the**rapeutic alliance. Attitudes towards telepsychology and empathic accuracy were both signif**icant p**redictors of alliance in the telepsychology delivery formats. Interestingly, empathic accuracy **did not p****redict** the thera**peutic** alliance for clients in the** in-pe**rson condition. Conclusions: Although preliminary, the results suggest that the technology-mediated psychotherapy processes o**f empathi****c accu**racy and therapeutic alliance seem to be simila**r to i**n-person psychotherapy. Empathic accuracy, however, may be a m**ore sa**lient process for clients who receive services in a telepsychology format.

The aim of this paper is to know the real situation in the use of information and communication technologies alongside the attitude of psychologists in Madrid Region. We conducted a quantitative research by means of a questionnaire based on previous literature reviews regarding the same topic in other countries. The sample consisted of all psychologists registered in the Spanish Psychology Association (COP), Madrid branch, with a total 486 responses. Only 26% use teletherapy along with other combined therapy modality involving face to face communication. Drawbacks in the study include primarily limitations of non-verbal communication and the **therapeut**ic **allianc**e, followed by confidentiality of data and technical problems with handling data.  2017 Colegio Oficial de Psiclogos de Madrid eid: 2-s2.0-85019267843
3. **"Going the Extra Mile": Satisfaction and Alliance Findings from an Evaluation of Videoconferencing Telepsychology in Rural Western Australia**
Objective: Technology is changing how we behave, communicate, and process information, and this has significant implications for mental health care. Telepsychology has appeal as a solution to obstacles of distance and access in **rural** and regional areas; however, few services appear to provide telepsychology as a routine service component for psycho**therapeut**ic exchanges. The primary research goal of a multi-year PhD project was to explore and explain the disconnect between research and practice in telepsychology, and to investigate, among other things, how telepsychology changes the clinician's usual practice or the **client**'s behaviour. Methods: Eight adult participants were seen for 68hours of direct **videoconfer**encing telepsychology over 11 months, and 53 separate points of data for e**ach cl**ient that included the perspectives of b**oth th**e client and **therapist** were** colle**cted. Clients completed technical, process, and therapy-based **satisfact**ion surveys after each **session**, in addition to standardised clinical symptom rating. Results: This manuscript will summarise some of the project's research findings in relation to specific practice techniques, with a particular focus** on thera**peutic **allianc**e **and satis**faction. Conclusions: In possible contrast to the opinions of those less familiar with telepsychology, we conclude that if telepsychology is not treated apologetically it can **achieve t**herapeutic results, albeit via a different route, favourably comparable to those achieved in face-to-face encounters.  2015 The Australian Psychological Society. eid: 2-s2.0-84937565058

We conducted a pilot study to assess the feasibility and acceptability of **videoconfer**encing as a means of providing a clinical psychology service in the Shetland Islands. A general practitioner was equipped with a desktop PC-based system connected to a mainland hospi**tal videoco**nferencing system by ISDN at 128 kbit/s. Qualitative methods were used to assess user **satisfact**ion, the ability to form a **therapeut**ic relationship and **client** improvement. Over one year, 10 patients (eight female, two male) participated** in the vid**eoconferencing therapy **session**s. The psychologist and all but one of **the cl**ients were highly satisfi**ed with the** videoconferencing therapy sessio**ns.

5. **Assessment of the therapeutic alliance in face-to-face or videoconference treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder**
Telepsychotherapy is a cutting-edge intervention that shows great promise in the mental health care field. However, the possibility of developing a high-quality **therapeut**ic **allianc**e is often doubted when psychotherapy is provided remotely. This study assesses the development o**f a thera**peu**tic all**iance in individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder who were treated either by **videoconfer**ence therapy or a face-to-face therapy. Forty-six participants with PTSD received cognitive behavioral therapy, 17 of them** by videoco**nference and 29 in **person**. A variety of questionnaires evaluating the quality** of the t**herapeutic relationship were administered at five different times during treatment. Each **session** was also assessed by the **therapist** and the participant immediately afterwards. The results indi**cate that** a ther**apeutic** alliance can develop very well in both treatment conditions and that there is no significant difference between the two.

Most college counseling centers do not utilize telehealth despite evidence of positive outcomes. The aim of this study was to examine the telehealth experience of students in a college counseling center. Participants were health professional students who utilized at least one telehealth visit between November 2015 and April 2017 (N=67). Methods: In June 2017, the authors administered a telehealth survey that assessed access, experience, effectiveness, and impact on **therapeut**ic **allianc**e. Of 67 students, 36 (53.7%) responded. The majority reported telehealth was convenient (34, 94.4%), time-saving (34, 94.4%), and helped them to feel better (30, 83.3%). Over half used telehealth because of distance (20, 55.5%). Eighty-one percent reported telehealth as being as good, nearly as good, or no different than meeting in **person**. Conclusion: Telehealth is a viable option for college counseling centers and is experienced as convenient, time-saving, and effective with little negative impact** on thera**peu**tic all**iance.  2018,  2018 Taylor & Francis. eid: 2-s2.0-85052063325

In the wake of the recent pandemic of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), with confirmed cases having crossed 750,000, health systems across the world are getting overwhelmed; making it strenuous to maintain essential health services. Several changes were implemented in our acute mental health care service using a collaborative **approach** to maintain a balance between preventive measures to flatten the curve and to provide care to those who were in need. Mode of service delivery was changed predominantly to tele-medicine, amongst others. It was found to be a workable model, albeit further follow up will be required to better understand its viability and feasibility to withstand the COVID-19 cataclysm.  2020 eid: 2-s2.0-85083013026
1. **Psychosis 101: Evaluating a training programme for northern and remote youth mental health service providers**
Background: Most of the early psychosis intervention (EPI) training has focused on family physicians participants. In Northern Ontario, there is a shortage of primary care. This paper will present **evalu**ation results of a pilot training **programm**e for rural and **remot**e youth mental health service providers. Method: A mixed methods **approach** was used.** We e**valuated a 2-day workshop about EPI for non-medical mental health workers delivered onsite and simultaneously by videoconferencing. There were 19 participants across four agencies. Seven were onsite and 12 were offsite. Participants' knowledge was measured using a validated questionnaire at pre-intervention and at 3-, 6- and 9-month follow up. A repeated measures ANOVA was **used **to evaluate knowledge acquisition between the two modes of training. At 6 months, focus group interviews were conducted to explore their experiences of the mode of intervention d**elive**ry and evaluation. Emerging themes were iteratively derived through a series of discussions involving independent coders. Results: Only 15 complete datasets were available of the 19 original participants. Differences in knowledge acquisition between the two groups did not reach statistical difference. Six-month focus group data indicated that participants improved their relationship with EPI services and they were part of a strengthened network with other providers in the **region**. Post-intervention, the accuracy of referrals from participating agencies increased dramatically, with an increase in proportion of referrals who were eligible for EPI services. The follow-up process engaged participants in learning and re-engaged them with the material taught during the training session. Conclusions: The results about **develop**ing service partnerships and relationship with specialist services are encouraging for policy and service decision-makers to address mental health service needs in northern **and r**emote areas.  2013 Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd. eid: 2-s2.0-84886747839
2. **Post-disaster gulf coast recovery using telehealth**
Objective: The Gulf Coast continues to struggle with service need far outpacing available resources. Since 2005, the **Region**al Coordinating Center for Hurricane **Respons**e (RCC) at Morehouse School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, has supported telehealth solutions designed to meet high service needs (e.g., psychiatry) within primary care and other healthcare organizations. The overall RCC vision is to support autonomous, useful, and sustainable telehealth programs towards mitigating unmet disaster-related needs. Subjects and Methods: To assess Gulf Coast telehealth experiences, we conducted semistructured interviews with b**oth re**gional **key** informants and national organizations with Gulf Coast recovery interests. Using qualitative-descriptive analysis, interview transcripts were analyzed to identify shared **develop**ment themes. Results: Thirty-ei**ght** key informants were interviewed, representing a 77.6% participation rate among organizations engaged by the RCC. Seven elements critical to telehealth success were identified: Funding, Regulatory, Workflow, Attitudes, Personnel, Technology, and **Evalu**ation**. T**hese key informant accounts reveal shared insights with telehealth regarding successes, challenges, and recommendations. Conclusions: The seven elements critical to telehealth success both confirm and organ**ize dev**elopment principles from a diverse collective of healthcare stakeholders. The structured nature of these insights suggests a generalizable **framework** upon which other organization**s might** develop telehealth strategies toward addressing high service needs with limited resources.

3. **The evolution of a successful telemedicine mental health service**
**Develop**ment of telemedicine mental health services in Alberta evolved via a pilot project, the delivery of routine services to a small group of centres and subsequent expansion to a province-wide **programm**e. Success of the service was linked to support for telehealth by the provincial government and consultation between the Alberta Mental Health Board (AMHB) and local stakeholders. Assessments by the AMHB have shown that telepsychiatry is acceptable and sustainable at a realistic cost. However, there are few measures of clinical effectiveness available and none of cost-effectiveness. A detailed economic **evalu**ation of the telemedicine mental health network would now be a major task. The expansion of telemedicine mental health services has increased the expectations of health-care decision makers. In addition, the complexity of the network has increased and new initiatives, such as the use of telepsychology, have been introduced. Management of this successful telehea**lth prog**ramme continues to be time consuming and challenging. eid: 2-s2.0-0344807705

The **Region**al Coordinating Center for Hurricane **Respons**e (RCC) collaborated with the EXPORT Centers (Centers of Excellence in Partnerships for Community Outreach, Research on Health Disparities and Training) to rebuild, revitalize, and improve the health care infrastructure in the Gulf Coast states damaged by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. This initiative aims to enhance the provision of health care by installing Electronic Health Records and Telepsychiatry systems throughout the Gulf Coast. Through the EXPORT Centers, the RCC plans to perform screening and surveillance projects within the communities and **develop** research projects focused on eliminating health disparities affecting underserved populations in **the re**gion. Another goal is to establish partnerships with EXPORT Centers, Community Health Centers, and other essential primary care practices in hurricane-ravaged communities. Through these partnerships, the overarching goal is to create a balanced health care system model that academic institutions can integrate into preventive care for emergency planning and research. eid: 2-s2.0-34249313686
5. **Designing a framework for the evaluation of paediatric telepsychiatry: A participatory approach**
While there is a great deal of interest in **evalu**ating participants' experiences of teleconsultation **programm**es, specific **framework**s for s**uch e**valuations are scarce. We have conducted a multi-stage consultation to **develop**** a frame**work for the study of a paediatric telepsychia**try prog**ramme. Emphasis was placed on ensuring the participation of stakeholders in the design and **respons**e stage** of t**he evaluation. A three-part **approach** was taken that comprised an opinion scan, focus groups and individual interviews. This resulted in the identification of specific areas of enqu**iry f**or the evaluation. One of the **key** points to emerge was that attending to context is vital. In the case of telepsychiatry, it is critical to understand the nuances of the local community for whom consultations are being provided. This involves considering the 'social e**colog**y' of each e**valua**tion site. The evaluation should take the form of** a di**alogue between the** eval**uators and those being evaluated, in order to maximize the uptake and integration of its findin**gs. The f**ramework we h**ave dev**eloped should be viewed as a guide that is general enough to be used in the design of many different types of telepsy**chiatry **programme. eid: 2-s2.0-3142550831
6. **An assessment framework for telemedicine applications**
Pressures for the adoption of telemedicine place increased demands on purchasers to assess applications of the technique. Assessment principles are helpful in defining an **evalu**ation **framework** for use at the local level. We suggest an assessment **approach** that includes five specific elements: specification; performance measures; outcomes; summary measures; and operational and other considerations. **The appr**oach described here was **develop**ed to assist with the needs of individual health authorities and institutions within the health-care system of Alberta. Aspects** of the **approach are illustrated using a telepsychiatry example under the assumptions made. Conventional psychiatry (where the patient visited the psychiatrist) was most expensive for the patient. The alternatives, telepsychiatry and outreach psychiatry (where the psychiatrist travelled to the patient), cost about the same from the service provider's perspective (and from that of society as a whole); they were both much cheaper for the patient. At higher volumes, telepsychiatry would be cheaper than outreach. eid: 2-s2.0-0033253290
7. **ICD-10 telepsychiatry education in Western Australia: Bridging the distance**
Aim: To **develop** a telepsychiatry educational **programm**e based on the Primary Care Version of the World Health Organization (WHO) ICD-10 Classification of Mental Disorders and the WHO Mental Disorders in Primary Care train**ing prog**ramme and to **evalu**ate the feasibility of deliver**ing the **programme to primary care mental health practitioners at **remot**e and rural services across Western Australia. Methods: The ICD-10 telepsychiatry educational material **was dev**eloped and formatted onto a navigable CD-ROM disk. There were six clinical modules as recommended by the WHO **educatio**nal programme including: anxiety, depression, alcohol use disorders, sleep problems, chronic tiredness and unexplained somatic c**omplaint**s. This programme was delivered across eight participating sites by simultaneous videoconferencing over six one hour sessions. Knowledge of the material taught was assessed by a specifically designed knowle**dge-e**valuation form before and** after t**he teaching programme. Results: There were 32 participants in total representing several allied mental h**ealth di**sciplines. Post-programme kn**owled**ge evaluation forms were returned by 16 participants (50%). Analysis of the data showed significant improvement in knowledge about anxiety, unexplained somatic complaints, alcohol use disorders and sl**eep diso**rders following the programme. Conclusion: This study provides preliminary evide**nce of t**he effectiveness of our programme in increasing the knowledge of practitioners in regard to the diagnosis and management of **key** mental disorders common in primary care settings. Furthermore, it demonstrates the feasibility and** accepta**bility of delivering such a programme by simultaneous multi-site videoconferencing to rural **and r**emote locations.  2007 Informa UK Ltd. eid: 2-s2.0-84871480529

0. **Telepsychiatry for stable Chinese psychiatric out-patients in custody in Hong Kong: A case-control pilot study**
Introduction: In Hong Kong, persons in custody receive primary medical care within the institutions of the Correctional Services Department (CSD). However, for psychiatric care, persons in custody must attend specialist out-patient clinics (SOPCs), which may cause embarrassment and stigmatisation. The aim of this interventional pilot study was to compare **teleconsult**ations with face-to-face consultations for a group of stable Chinese psychiatric out-patients in custody. Methods: A total of 86 stable Chinese male out-patients in custody were recruited for psychiat**ric telecon**sultations. They were compared with 249 age-matched Chinese male out-patients in custody attending standard face-to-face psychiatric consultations at other SOPCs. The two groups had comparable baseline characteristics including age, education level, and 12-item Chinese General Health Questionnaire (C-GHQ-12) score. A **satisfact**ion survey of patients towa**rds the tel**econsultation was also carried out. Results: Compared with the face-to-face consultation** group, the** teleconsultation group showed a significantly better result in the difference in C-GHQ-12 scores before and after consultations (P=0.023). The correlation between the f**irst and se**cond teleconsultations also showed a moderate positive relationship (r=0.309). **The satis**faction survey showed a fav**ourable res**ponse to teleconsultations. No significant adverse events **were identi**fied for the teleconsultation group. Conclusion**s: The resu**lts suggest that teleconsultations are a sustainable and safe alternative to face-to-face consultations for stable Chinese psychiatric out-patients in custody. 2018 Hong Kong Academy of Medicine. eid: 2-s2.0-85051778746
1. **The North Lewisham Telepsychiatry Project: Beyond the Pilot Phase**
The integration of a telepsychiatry application into an inner-city community mental health service was evaluated over 10 months. ISDN **videoconferenc**ing at 128 kbit/s was employed for psychiatric consultation between a primary care centre and a community mental health centre. A convenience **sampl**e of patients and referrals seen** by videoconfe**rencing was compared wit**h a s**ample seen **face to fac**e. During the study period 19 patients were man**aged by videoc**onferencing and** 12 face to** face. There were 162 consultations, comprising 81 prearranged **teleconsult**ations and 81 prearranged face-to-face consultations. There was no significant difference in attenda**nce between vi**deoconferencing and face-to-face consultatio**ns. Nine of th**e videoconferencing new referrals had not completed their treatment at the end of the study period, compared with only three in the face-to-face group. This implies that it takes longer to complete treatment for new r**eferrals manag**ed by videoconferencing.  2002, SAGE Publications. All rights reserved. eid: 2-s2.0-18144452475
2. **Treatment outcome comparison between telepsychiatry and face-to-face buprenorphine medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorder: A 2-year retrospective data analysis**
Objectives: To retrospectively review clinic records to assess the difference between face-to-face and telepsychiatry buprenorphine medication-assisted treatment (MAT) programs for the treatment of opioid use disorder on 3 **outcom**es: additional substance use, average time to achieve 30 and 90 consecutive days of abstinence, and treatment retention rates at 90 and 365 days. Methods: Medical records of patients (N=100) who were participating in telepsychiatry and in face-to-face group-based **outpati**ent buprenorphine MAT programs were reviewed and assessed using descriptive statistical analysis. Results: In comparison with the telepsychiatry MAT group, the face-to-face MAT group showed no significant difference in terms of additional substance use, time to 30 days (P=0.09) and 90 days of abstinence (P=0.22), or retention rates at 90 and 365 days (P=0.99). Conclusions: We did not find any significant statistical difference between telepsychiatry buprenorphine MAT intervention through **videoconferenc**e and face-to-face MAT treatment in our Comprehensive Opioid Addiction Treatment model for individuals diagnosed with opioid use disorder in terms of additional substance use, average time to 30 and 90 days of abstinence, and treatment retention rates.

3. **Accuracy of telepsychiatric assessment of new routine outpatient referrals**
Background: Studies on the feasibility of telepsychiatry tend to concentrate only on a subset of clinical parameters. In contrast, this study utilises data from a comprehensive assessment. The main objective of this study is to compare the accuracy of findings from telepsychiatry with those from **face to fac**e interviews. Method: This is a primary, cross-sectional, single-cluster, balanced crossover, blind study involving new routine psychiatric referrals. Thirty-seven out of forty cases fulfilling the selection criteria went through a complete set of independ**ent face to** face and video assessments by the researchers who were blind to each other's findings. Results: The accuracy ratio of the pooled results for DSM-IV diagnoses, risk assessment, non-drug and drug interventions were all above 0.76, and the combined **overal**l accuracy ratio was 0.81. There were substantial intermethod agreements for Cohen's kappa on all the major components of evaluation except on the Risk Assessment Scale where there was only weak agreement. Conclusion: Telepsychiatric assessment is a dependable method of assessment with a high degree of accuracy and substant**ial ov**erall intermethod agreement when compared with s**tandard fac**e to face interview for new routine **outpati**ent psychiatric referrals.  2007 Singh et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd. eid: 2-s2.0-38149015474
4. **An incremental cost analysis of telehealth in Nova Scotia from a societal perspective**
We examined the costs of telehealth in Nova Scotia from a societal perspective. The clinical **outcom**es of telepsychiatry and teledermatology services were assumed to be similar to those for conventional face-to-face consultations. Cost information was obtained from the Nova Scotia Department of Health, the Canadian Institute for Health Information, and questionnaires to patients, physicians and telehealth coordinators. There were 215 questionnaires completed by patients, 135 by specialist physicians and eight by telehealth coordinators. Patient costs for a face-to-face consultation ranged from $240 to $1048 (all costs in Canadian dollars), whereas patient costs for telehealth were lower, from $17 to $70. However, from a societal perspective, the **overal**l cost of providing face-to-face services was lower than for telehealth: the total costs for face-to-face services ranged from $325 to $1133, while the total costs for telehealth services ranged from $1736 to $28,084. A threshold analysis showed that, above a certain patient workload, telehealth services would be more cost-effective than face-to-face services from a societal perspective. This workload is attainable in Nova Scotia. eid: 2-s2.0-15944418935
5. **The effectiveness of telepsychiatry measured using the Health of the Nation Outcome Scale and the Mental Health Inventory**
In a telepsychiatry project in rural Queensland, data were collected from 124 patients attending hospital and general practice facilities for mental health-care and then again at follow-up one year later. Thirty-two of the patients were dealt with using telepsychiatry. Two health status scales were used to measure effectiveness: the Health of the Nation **Outcom**e Scale (HoNOS), administered by the practitioners; and the Mental Health Inventory (MHI), which was self-administered by the patients. There was a significant difference between the initial assessment and follow-up groups on most subscales of the HoNOS, but no significant difference between the face-to-face and telepsychiatry groups. Similarly, the MHI results showed a significant difference on all subscales between the initial assessment and follow-up groups, but no significant difference between the face-to-face and telepsychiatry groups. Individuals who used and did not use telepsychiatry all had improved hea**lth ou**tcome scores on the HoNOS and MHI during the study period. Telepsychiatry was as effective as face-to-face care. eid: 2-s2.0-0037264574
6. **Does the Use of Telemental Health Alter the Treatment Experience? Inmates' Perceptions of Telemental Health Versus Face-to-Face Treatment Modalities**
In corrections, where staffing limitations tax an overburdened mental health system, telemental health is an increasingly common mode of mental health service delivery. Although telemental health presents an efficient treatment modality for a spectrum of mental health services, it is imperative to study how this modality influences key elements of the treatment experience. In this study, the authors compared inmates' perceptions of the working alliance, postsession mood, and **satisfact**ion with psychiatric and psychological mental health services delivered through 2 different modalities: telemental health and face-to-face. Participants consisted of 186 inmates who received mental health services (36 via telepsychology, 50 via face-to-face psychology, 50 via telepsychiatry, and 50 via face-to-face psychiatry). Results indicate no significant differences in inmates' perceptions of the work alliance with the mental health professional, postsession mood, or over**all satis**faction with services when telemental health and face-to-face modalities were compared within each type of mental health service. Implications of these findings are presented.  2008 American Psychological Association. eid: 2-s2.0-38949111763
7. **Cost effectiveness, safety, and satisfaction with video telepsychiatry versus face-to-face care in ambulatory settings**
**Videoconferenc**e telepsychiatry provides an alternative for the psychiatric treatment of mental health patients who reside in remote communities. The objective of this study was to compare institutional ambulatory and hospitalization costs, treatment adherence, patient and physician **satisfact**ion, and treatment safety between mental healthcare **via videoconfe**rencing and care provided in person. Data collected for 1 year of telepsychiatry treatment was compared to that of the preceding year and a matched comparison group. Twenty-nine patients from Or Akiva and 20 patients from Reut Hostel in Hadera who met the inclusion criteria agreed to participate; 24 and 15 patients, respectively, completed the study. Forty-two matched patients, who continued face-to-face interviews, comprised the comparison group. Drop-out patients and those who did not consent to telepsychiatry treatment were not involved. During the year of telepsychiatry treatment, patients and physicians were satisfied and treatment was safe. However, 1 hour of telepsychiatry treatment was more expensive than face-to-face care, and a tendency of increased hospitalizations was noted. Adherence ratios before and during telepsychiatry treatment were similar, but were twice as high versus the comparison group. The limited **sampl**e size precludes the drawing of definite conclusions, and further studies involving a larger study population and longer duration of investigation is warranted.

8. **Is telepsychiatry equivalent to face-to-face psychiatry? Results from a randomized controlled equivalence trial**
Objective: The use of interactive **videoconferenc**ing to provide psychiatric services to geographically remote regions, often referred to as telepsychiatry, has gained wide acceptance. However, it is not known whether clinical **outcom**es of telepsychiatry are as good as those achieved through face-to-face contact. This study compared a variety of clini**cal ou**tcomes after psychiatric consultation and, where needed, brief follow-up for **outpati**ents referred to a psychiatric clinic in Canada who were randomly assigned to be examined **face to fac**e or by telepsychiatry. Methods: A total of 495 patients in Ontario, Canada, referred by their family physician for psychiatric consultation were randomly assigned to be exami**ned face to** face (N=254) or by telepsychiatry (N=241). The treating psychiatrists had the option of providing monthly follow-up appointments for up to four months. The study tested the equivalence of the two forms of service delivery on a var**iety o**f outcome measures. Results: Psychiatric consultation and follow-up delivered by telepsychiatry produc**ed cli**nical outcomes that were equivalent to those achieved when the service was p**rovided fac**e to face. Patients in the two groups expressed similar levels of **satisfact**ion with service. An analysis limited to the cost of providing the clinical service indicated that telepsychiatry was at least 10% less expensive per patient than servi**ce provided** face to face. Conclusions: Psychiatric consultation and short-term follow-up can be as effective when delivered by telepsychiatry a**s when prov**ided face to face. These findings do not necessarily mean that other types of mental health services, for example, various types of psychotherapy, are as effective when provided by telepsychiatry. eid: 2-s2.0-34250894450
9. **Evaluating the diagnostic agreement between telepsychiatry assessment and face-to-face visit: A preliminary study**
Objective: Despite accumulated evidence that demonstrates clinical **outcom**e of telepsychiatry is comparable with conventional method; little research has been done on telepsychiatry in developing countries. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic agreement between telepsychiatry assessment and face-to-face assessment. Moreover, patient and doctor **satisfact**ion was assessed by self-report questionnaire. Method: This study was conducted in an inpatient department of a university-affiliated hospital in Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Iran. The study **sampl**e consisted of 40 inpatients aged over 18 years who were selected from October 2016 to February 2017. All patients were visited once by face-to-face conventional method and once by interactive video **teleconsult**ation by 2 psychiatric consultants. Results: Results of this study revealed that the diagnostic agreement between the 2 interviewers was 75%. Moreover, about 85% of the patients preferred telepsychiatry for follow-up visits. Also, more than 82% of the patients would recommend telepsychiatry to others although 95% of them perceived contact via telepsychiatry as uncomfortable to some extent. Conclusion: Telepsychiatry service can be used for psychiatric evaluation in Iran, and it has a desirable effect on patient and doc**tor satis**faction. The results of this study showed the capacity of moving towards using telepsychiatry.  2020 Korean Cancer Association. All rights reserved. eid: 2-s2.0-85083399092
10. **A randomized clinical trial of home-based telepsychiatric outpatient care via videoconferencing: Design, methodology, and implementation**
Background: Healthcare providers are continuously challenged to find innovative, cost-effective alternatives and to scale up existent services to meet the growing demand upon mental health care delivery. Due to continuous advances in technologies, telepsychiatry has become an effective tool for psychiatric care. In 2012, the Institute of Psychiatry of the University of So Paulo Medical School started a randomized clinical trial of home-based telepsychiatric **outpati**ent care via **videoconferenc**ing. Objective: The objective of this article is to describe the design, methodology and implementation of a pilot project, which aimed to verify the applicability and efficiency of psychiatric attendance via Internet-ba**sed videoconfe**rencing in a resource-constrained environment. Methods: The project consisted of a 12 months follow-up study with a randomized clinical trial, which compared various quality indicators between home-based telepsychiatric afterc**are via videoc**onferencing and face-to-face aftercare. Results: The final **sampl**e comprised **107 out**patients (53 in the telepsychiatry group and 54 in the control group). Among 1,227 realized consultations, 489 w**ere held by vi**deoconferencing. **Satisfact**ion with t**he aftercare b**y videoconferencing and the medication delivery was high among patients. Attending psychiatrists were satisfied wit**h the assistan**ce by videoconferencing. Discussion: The experiences during this pilot project have **overal**l been very positive and psyc**hiatr**ic** outpatien**t care by videoconferencing seems viable to treat patients even in a resource-constrained environment.  2015, Lemos Editorial e Graficos Ltda.

1. **Informed collaboration in health care: An embedded-cases study in geriatric telepsychiatry**
Telemedicine, the delivery of medical consultation and services, is enabled by information and communications technologies. Participants in telemedicine consultation services (ie, clinicians, patients, and other parties) use **video** conferencing, special-purpose software and/or hardware, and data and notes from electronic medical records and other systems to formulate effective treatment plans. Telemedicine is a particular mode of informed **collabor**ationinformation and communications technologysuppor**ted coll**aborative activity i**n which **collaborators rely (wholly or in part) on digitally stored information retrieved from various sources to pursue their collective objectives. We report on an embedded-cases study of a long-running geriatric telepsychiatry clinic in the north-eastern United States. Our analysis draws on the theory of distributed cognition (DCog) to explicate the ways in which information and cognitive effort are distributed across individuals and artefacts to support psychiatric consultation from a distance and how these processes play out over time in routines. On the basis of this case study, we offer a refinement of DCog theory, focusing on four interrelated dynamic processes that, we propose, act as critical enablers **of infor**med collaboration: cognitive offloading, visibility of action, intersubjective understanding, and knowledge redundancy. We **discuss** practical implications for designing telemedicine services and tools, and we offer suggestions for further resea**rch on i**nformed collaboration.  2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd eid: 2-s2.0-85052650861

3. **A study on collaborative telepsychiatric consultations to outpatients of district hospitals of Karnataka, India**
Introduction: The **India**n National Mental Health Survey (NMHS) of 20152016 has estimated 13.7% lifetime and 10.6% point prevalence for mental illnesses. It has identified that the treatment gap for mental illnesses ranges between 70% and 92%. Tele-Psychiatric consultations could be an alternative and innovative approach to bridge this gap in low resource settings. Aims: To study the sociodemographic and clinical profiles of patients who have received **collabor**ative Tele-Psychiatric consultations across district hospitals in Karnata**ka, I**ndia. Methodology: We performed a retrospective review of case files of patients who have recei**ved coll**aborative Tele-Psychiatric consultations from January 2013 to June 2017 through **video**-conferencing. A total of 139 consultations were provided to patients in the state of Karnataka. Results: The mean age of the sample is 31 (15.5) years. 61.8% were male and 79.8% were aged more than 18 years. In total, 25.9% of them had **schizophrenia** and other psychotic disorders, 14.4% had mental retardation, 13.7% had a mood disorder and 14.4% had a substance use disorder. 67.6% of patients had been advised pharmacotherapy, 7.9% had been advised rehabilitation along with pharmacotherapy and 24.4% were advised further evaluation of illness and inpatient care at a higher centre. Conc**lusion: **Collaborative tele-psychiatric consultations to district hospitals from an **academ**ic tertiary care hospital can be feasible and are likely to benefit patients from **rural** areas. There is a need for more studies to elucidate their acceptability by patients, caregivers and professionals.  2018 Elsevier B.V. eid: 2-s2.0-85054061928
4. **Alcohol abuse management in primary care: An e-learning course**
Background: The mental health knowledge gap challenges public health. The Alcohol Abuse Management in Primary Care (AAMPC) is an e-learning **cours**e designed to cover alcohol-related problems from the primary care perspective. The goal of this study was to verify if the AAMPC was able to enhance healthcare professionals' alcohol-related problems knowledge. Materials and Methods: One hundred subscriptions for the AAMPC were offered through the federal telehealth program. **The c**ourse was instructor-led and had nine weekly classes, delivered synchronously or asynchronously, at the students' convenience, using a varied array of learning tools. At the beginning, students took a test that provided a positive score, related to critical knowledge for clinical management, and a negative score, related to misconceptions about alcohol-related problems. The test was repeated 2 month**s aft**er course completion. Results: Thirty-three students co**mplet**ed the course. The positive score improved significantly (p<0.001), but not the negative score. Students with previous ex**perie**nce with e-courses presented greater improvement on the positive score (p<0.036). Eighty-percent of the s**tuden**ts thought the course excelled in meeting its objectives. Web conferences and **video** and audio recordings were the most appr**eciat**ed learning tools. Course satisfaction was negatively related to frequency of Internet access (Spearman's rho=-0.455, p=0.022). Conclusions: E-learning was highly appreciated as a learning tool, especially by students with the least frequency of Internet use. Nonetheless, it worked better for those** prev**iously famil**iar w**ith e-courses. The AAMPC e-course provided effective knowledge transmission and retention. Complementary strategies to reduce misconceptions about alcohol-related problems must be **develop**ed for the training of primary care staff.

6. **Designing and implementing an innovative digitally driven primary care psychiatry program in India**
Background: Primary Care Doctors (PCDs) are the first contact for majority of patients with psychiatric disorders across the world including **India**. They often provide symptomatic treatment which is naturally inadequate. Absence or inadequate exposure to psychiatric training during undergraduate medical education is one of the prime reasons. Classroom training (CRT), a standard practice to train PCDs is driven by specialist based psychiatric curriculum and inherently lacks clinical translational value. Aim and Context: The 'Department of Psychiatry' of 'National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences', Bengalu**ru, I**ndia has recently come up with an innovative digitally driven modules of 'Primary Care Psychiatry Program' (PCPP) for practicing PCDs. Goal of this paper is to provide an overview of all these (five) modules with its various stages of implementation. Methods: Authors briefly **discuss** the current status of primary care psychi**atry **in India and also narrate the newly designed five modules of PCPP in this paper. Results **and Dis**cussion: An adopted psychiatric curriculum is designed in 'Clinical Schedules for Primary Care Psychiatry' (CSP) which is an integral part of PCPP. This is brief clinical schedules contains culturally appropriate screening questionnaire, transdiagnostic classification of 8 core psychiatric disorders, diagnostic, referral and management guidelines. PCPP contains 5 modules named as orientation module, basic module, advanced module [Tele-psychiatric 'On-Consultation Training' (Tele-OCT)], **video**conference based continuing skill **develop**ment module, and **collabor**at**ive v**ideo consultation modules which covers all essential areas of primary care psychiatry for practicing PCDs. Last three modules are fully designed digital modules in hub and spoke model of Tele Medicine. In this designed program, the CSP and Tele-OCT are two path braking innovations having inbuilt higher clinical translation value. The challenges and opportunities that could be faced during its implementa**tion **across India a**re also** discussed. Conclusion and Future Directions: Innovative PCPP is pragmatic in nature and has potential for higher clinical translational value. Once validated thoroughly, PCPP has po**tenti**al for pan-India expansion. There is a need for artificial intelligence-based modules for ne**xt ph**ase of PCPP in India considering her population and lesser number of availab**le ps**ychiatrists.  2018 Indian Journal of Psychiatry | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow. eid: 2-s2.0-85052293597
7. **Telepsychiatry and carer education for schizophrenia**
Objective: Despite the scientific evidence, most families of people with **schizophrenia** in Europe never receive a carer education programme. We evaluated whether a carer education **cours**e delivered by telepsychiatry was as effective as a carer educat**ion c**ourse delivered in situ. Method: We delivered the carer ed**ucati**on course **for schizophr**enia simultaneously to a carers group in **rural** north west Ireland (remote) via three ISDN lines and live to a carers group in a city (host). We compared knowledge gains using the Knowledge Questionnaire before and** afte**r each course. Results: Fifty-six carers of peop**le with schiz**ophrenia participated in the trial. At baseline, participants at the remote and host centers did not differ in terms of know**ledge about s**chizophr**enia.** After the course, carers at both centers improved significantly and the knowledge gains between groups were equivalent at 6. weeks. Conclusion: Telepsychiatry can deliver effective carer education p**rogrammes abo**ut schizophrenia and may provide one solution to bridging the chasm between scientific evidence and clinical reality.  2010 Elsevier Masson SAS. eid: 2-s2.0-79960471492

This study examines the variations in the use of inpatient care that can be explained by travel distance among patients with **schizophrenia** living in Taiwan. Data were drawn from the Psychiatric Inpatient Medical Claims Database. We used mediation analysis and multilevel analysis to identify associations. Travel distance did not significantly account for lower readmission rates after an index admission, but significantly explained the longer length of stay of an index admission by 9.3 days (P < 0.001, 85% of variation) between remote and non-remote regions. Policies are **discuss**ed aimed at reducing the impact of travel distance on **rural** **mental health car**e through inter-disciplinary **collabor**ation and telepsychiatry.  2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC. eid: 2-s2.0-50249151884
9. **Psychological interventions during COVID-19: Challenges for low and middle income countries**
At the start of 2020, the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), originating from China has spread to the world. There have been increasing numbers of confirmed cases and deaths around the globe. The COVID-19 pandemic has paved the way for considerable psychological and psychosocial morbidity among the general public and health care providers. An array of guidelines has been put forward by multiple agencies for combating mental health challenges. This paper addresses some of the mental health challenges faced by low and middle income countries (LMIC). It is worthwhile to note that these are challenges at the current stage of the pandemic and may change with the **cours**e of the pandemic itself.  2020 Elsevier B.V. eid: 2-s2.0-85084129392
10. **Developing Texting for Relapse Prevention: A Scalable mHealth Program for People with Schizophrenia and Schizoaffective Disorder**
Symptom relapse in people with **schizophrenia** and schizoaffective disorder is common and has a negative impact on the **cours**e of illness. Here, we describe the **develop**ment of Texting for Relapse Prevention, a scalable, cost-effective text messaging relapse prevention program that queries patients' "early warning signs" daily. Results** of dev**elopment focus groups and content advisory teams with 25 patients and 19 providers suggest that patients were enthusiastic about the program and thought that receiving daily messages about their symptoms would help them feel supported. Providers also were positive about the idea but worried that the program might interfere with patient-provider communication if patients thought that the messages were coming from providers. Patients found the content positive and actionable. The program was improved to address this feedback. This it**erative** development process that included multiple stakeholders ensured that the program is feasible and acceptable to both patients and providers.  Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

0. **Attitudes Towards Implementation of Store-and-Forward Telemental Health in Humanitarian Settings: Survey of Syrian Healthcare Providers**
Store-and-forward (SandF) telemedicine is thought to be most applicable in humanitarian settings. Unlike other kinds of telemental health (TMH), SandF requires engagement and active **particip**ation from healthcare providers in submitting text or audio-video clinical material for consultations. To implement such consultative systems there is a need to gauge providers' attitudes towards this technology. Materials and Methods: An electronic survey was sent to Syrian healthcare providers (physicians and nonphysicians) who are affiliated with humanitarian nongovernmental organizations managing Syrians affected by war. After a description of what TMH and SandF a**re, part**icipants were asked about their attitudes towards such services. Results: Fifty-two providers responded to the electronic survey. Only results from providers inside Syria (n=30) are presented. The majority of respondents had no **experi**ence with TMH. Half of the providers believed that mental healthcare can be provided through SandF and that there would be a benefit from such services. Respondents reported that **cultur**al (68%), financial (84%), and technical (80%) barriers do exist for such services. When asked, providers believed that patients would agree to be audiotaped (58%) for the purpose of SandF compared with being videotaped (15%) (p=0.007). Conclusions: Electronic surveys of healthcare workers in humanitarian settings are feasible. Providers in the Syrian humanitarian setting have lit**tle ex**perience in TMH; however, they are open to using an SandF service while acknowledg**ing cu**ltural, financial, and technical barriers to the implementation.  2016 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-84954457631
1. **Reactions of psychiatric patients to telepsychiatry**
Telepsychiatry could offer a viable medical service to remote or isolated social communities if it does not generate adverse reactions such as delusional ideation, particularly in patients in settlements without adequate exposure to mainstream **cultur**e and internet. We examined subjective reactions to telepsychiatry of randomly selected 84 psychiatric patients from remote locations in Ontario, Canada. They rated the quality of their teleconferencing sessions via 10 item questionnaire and were asked about advantages and disadvantages of telepsychiatry. The majority of patients indicated that they were able to communicate as if physically present (92.9%) and were **comfort**able with telepsychiatric service (95.2%). They found the sessions as beneficial as direct meetings with their psychiatrist (84.5%) and would use this service again (98.8%). There were no instances of telepsychiatry being associated with adverse reactions in patients from remote communities with inadequate exposure to modern mainstr**eam cu**lture and internet.  R. Campbell et al., 2015. eid: 2-s2.0-84945530505
2. **Telepsychiatry services for Korean immigrants**
Asian Americans often face **cultur**al and language barriers when obtaining mental health treatment. With the small number of Asian mental health providers, it is difficult to ensure the linguistic and ethnic matching of providers and patients. Telepsychiatry holds great promise to address the unique needs of Asian Americans. We developed a project to establish telepsychiatry services that connect **Korean** mental health patients in Georgia with a linguistically **and cu**lturally competent psychiatrist in California and assessed the level of acceptability of psychiatric treatment via real-time teleconferencing among these patients. Upon the completion of the program, 16 patients (5 men, 11 women) completed a questionnaire that measured their acceptability of the telepsychiatry service. The findings indicate a high level of acceptance of the program am**ong Ko**rean patients. The quantitative and qualitative data show that they especially apprecia**ted th**e cultural sensitivity of the consultation and the **comfort**able interaction with the provider. However, challenges such as technical issues of teleconferencing may negatively affect the quality of the clinical interaction. Our study expands the knowledge base regarding the acceptability of such services to a population that **experi**ences disparities in mental health care. Future research should extend telepsychiatry services to other Asian population groups t**hat ex**perience lower access to **mental health servic**es.  2012, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-84871264338
3. **International telepsychiatry: A study of patient acceptability**
An international telepsychiatry service was established between Denmark and Sweden for cross-**cultur**al patient groups, such as asylum seekers, refugees and migrants. Over an 18-month period starting in mid 2006, 30 patients were treated by telepsychiatry (21 men and 9 women). The patients received mental health care by videoconferencing from providers who spoke the patients' own language, i.e. without the assistance of interpreters. The total number of telepsychiatry sessions was 203 (range 1-22; average 6.8 sessions per patient). Patients completed a **satisfact**ion questionnaire at the end of treatment. Seven patients (23%) were not able to complete a questionnaire, due to illiteracy and/or a psychotic condition. The rest of the patients (n=23) reported a high level of acceptance **and satis**faction with telepsychiatry, as well as a willingness to use it again or recommend it to others. Any disadvantages of telemedicine were compensated by the fact that the doctor and patient spoke the same language and had simi**lar cu**ltural and/or national references. Mentally ill asylum seekers, refugees and migrants are under-served in their mother tongue and telepsychiatry can improve access to scarce health-care resources. eid: 2-s2.0-64549119584
4. **Acceptability of telepsychiatry in American Indians**
Telepsychiatry differs from in-person treatment in terms of its delivery mechanism, and this dissimilarity may increase **cultur**al differences between the provider and the patient. Beca**use cu**ltural competence and identification can impact **patient **satisfact****ion ratings, we wanted to explore **whethe**r cultural differences in our study population influenced telepsychiatric and in-person interviews. Here, we compared the acceptability of conducting psychiatric assessments with rural American Indian veterans by real-time videoconferencing versus inperson administration. The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IIIR (SCID) was given to **particip**ants both in person and by telehealth. A process measure was created to ass**ess part**icipants' responses to the interview type concerning the usability of the technology, the perceptions of the interviewee/interviewer inter**action**, the cultural competence of the interview, **and satis**faction with the interview and the interview process. The process measure was administered to 53 American Indian Vietnam veterans both in-person and by real-time interactive videoconferencing. Mean responses were compared f**or each **participant. Interviewers were also asked several of the same quest**ions as **the participants; answers were compared to th**e corres**ponding participant responses. Overall, telepsychiatry was well received and comparable in level of patient **comfort**, sa**tisfac**tion, and cultural acceptance to in-person interviews. We also found evidence to suggest that interviewers sometimes interpreted part**icipant s**atisfaction as significantly less** favorab**le than the participants actually responded. Despite the potential of videoconfe**rencin**g to increase cultural differences, we found that it is an acceptable means for psychiatric assessment of American Indian veterans and presents an opportunity to provide **mental health servic**es to a population that might otherwise not have access.

5. **Cultural aspects of telepsychiatry**
Telepsychiatry may involve working with clinicians, patients and systems of care that are both geographically and **cultur**ally distinct. In this conte**xt, cu**lturally appropriate care is an important component of telepsychiatry. The outl**ine fo**r cultural formulation from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) provides general principles for addressing these issues. Two components of the outline are particularly relevant in telepsychiatry: **(1) ho**w the cultural background of patie**nts (i**.e. their cultural identity) influences their **comfort** with technology; an**d (2) **the effect of cultural differences on the patient**-provi**der relationship. Cultural differences between patient and provider are often highlighted in telepsychiatry by the patient and provider location (e.g. rural versus urban differences). Familiarity with the rural community and regular contact and feedback are important. Future research should examine the effect of telepsychiatry on patient-provider relationships, patient attitudes towards care and, most importantly, patient outcomes. eid: 2-s2.0-33748852573
6. **Telepsychiatry and cultural barrier in Korea**
This research was performed in order to empirically prove that telepsychiatry can result in overcoming of the Confucian **cultur**al barrier which discouraged **Korean** patients from seeking psychiatric care. The Confuc**ian cu**lture of Korea forces its members to observe absolute conformity to the social norm. In this **kind o**f culture it is very hard to admit one's mental illness and to seek medical help. Thus telepsychiatry might be a good alternative to face-to-face meeting-based psychiatry es**pecial**ly in culturally inhibitive places such as Korea. We conducted a telepsychiatry **experi**ment using Instant Messenger with 93 volunteers who had** an ex**perience of seeing a psychiatrist in person. The result shows that people tend to think that telepsychiatry allowed them to break out o**f the **Confucian cultural protocol which put heavy emphasis on avoiding any irregular thought. eid: 2-s2.0-77953016400

0. **Using telepsychiatry to enrich existing integrated primary care**
Background: Integrated care is characterized by evolving heterogeneity in models. Using telepsychiatry to enhance these models can increase access, quality, and efficiencies in care. Introduction: The purpose of this report is to describe the process and outcomes of adapting telepsychiatry into an existing integrated care service. Materials and Methods: Telepsychiatry was implemented into an existing integrated care model in a high-volume, urban, primary care clinic in Colorado serving patients with complex physical and **behavior**al needs. Consultative, direct care, educational/training encounters, provider-to-provider communication, process changes, and patient-level descriptive measures were tracked as **part** of ongoing quality improvement. Results: Telepsychiatry was adapted into the exist**ing beha**vioral health services using an iterative team meeting process within a stepped care model. Over 35% of the requests for psychiatry services were medication related-and medication changes (type/dose) were the most frequent referral outcome of psychiatric consultation. Forty percent of patients in the service had m**ultiple **behavioral health diagnoses, in addition to physical health diagnoses. Discussion: Telehealth will become an increasingly necessary component in building hybrid/blended integrated care teams. Examples of flexible model implementation will support clinics in tailoring effective applications for their unique patient panels. Conclusions: An adapted integrated care model leveraging telepsychiatry is successfully serving the complex deep end of a primary care patient population in Colorado. Lessons learned in implementing this model include the **import**ance of team attitudes.  2019, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-85071183030
1. **Demographic and psychiatric predictors of engagement in psychotherapy services conducted via clinical video telehealth**
Introduction: Military veterans are at high risk for developing mental health problems. Unfortunately, veterans have relatively low rates of engagement in mental health services compared with non-veterans. In order to address barriers to mental health care services, the Veterans Health **Administr**ation (VHA) has implemented clinical video telehealth (CVT). Although the effectiveness of this technology appears promising, there is limited research evaluating rates of engagement in CVT mental health services or what factors may predict premature attrition from mental health care delivered via this format. Methods: The present study aimed to investigate treatment engagement among veterans enrolled in psychotherapy delivered via CVT, as well as to explore the effects of various demographic and clinical characteristics on these outcomes. **Part**icipants were 250 veterans with consults placed to the CVT clinic at a large Midwestern VHA. To evaluate characteristics related to therapy retention, demographic and symptom profile information was gathered from a subset of** 93 **participants who attended at least one CVT psychotherapy appointment. Results: Results indicated there were no significant demographic differences between veterans who attended at least one CVT appointment and those who did not attend at least one session. Demographic variables were not related to the number of CVT visits attended. Regarding psychological characteristics, veterans with anxiety disorders attended fewer CVT appointments overall than veterans with mood disorders and attendance at CVT was negatively correlated with anxiety severity. Discussion: These findings have potential implications for providers working in CVT clinics as well as for future research in this area.  The Author(s) 2018. eid: 2-s2.0-85059667168
2. **Mobilization of Telepsychiatry in Response to COVID-19Moving Toward 21st Century Access to Care**
The COVID-19 pandemic threatens to disrupt the provision of mental health services. In response, policymakers, **administr**ators, and providers have taken bold steps toward enabling telepsychiatry to bridge this sudden gap in care for our most vulnerable populations. With rapid deregulation and adoption of this modality of care, careful consideration of issues related to policy and implementation is essential to maximize its effectiveness and mitigate unintended consequences. Though the crisis places the healthcare system under strain, it sets the stage for a lasting shift in not only how care is delivered, but also our beliefs around the systems capacity for rapid, innovative change.  2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, **part** of Springer Nature. eid: 2-s2.0-85084131396
3. **Bioethical principles available in therapeutic communication through SMS**
There is a new concept applicable in health communication: electronic health communication, or simply: e-health communication. The usage of e-health technologies in modern and psychological practice **gener**ates a series of bioethical issues and methodological challenges never encountered before. This article sets as main objective the identification of the bioethical aspects involved in the early forms of telemedicine and telepsychology, namely the ones obtained through the cell phone. The focus will be on SMS (short message service) - affordable and interactive application - that provides real interactions among patients and healthcare providers, **help**ing to improve access to the medical and psychological services for remote rural communities and marginal population.** In g**eneral, the studies testing the SMS efficiency in practice have positive feedback, covering several medical and psychological specialties (diabetes, nutrition diseases, cardiology, contagious diseases, ENT, obstetrics - gynecology, psychiatry, clinical psychology, psychotherapy, educational counselling, and others). A rigorous and systematic **analysi**s of the bioethical issues involved (benefits, risks, autonomy, informed contentment, non-discrimination) can clarify some of the controversies that arise in this revolutionary field. In the same time, such** an ana**lysis is likely to provide procedural openings, and technical and legal actions in telemedicine and telepsychology. The article also examines the possibility that these new practices would be introduced in Romania, in the interests of patients and of public health politics. There are auspicious premises as at the end of the year 2012 were, according to official statistics, 25.5 millions of cell phones users, who sent 909 million of SMS, out of 10.1 millions accessing the internet from their cell phones. eid: 2-s2.0-84902812553
4. **Successfully navigating multiple electronic health records when using telepsychiatry: The NC-STeP experience**
Telepsychiatry is a viable option for providing psychiatric care to those who are **current**ly underserved or who lack access to services, but barriers to its widespread utilization remain. Use of different electronic health record systems (EHRs) by various health care systems is one such barrier. Utilization of different EHRs makes it difficult for providers to review patient data and to document clinical encounters. This column describes a Web portal developed by the North Carolina Statewide Telepsychiatry Program that connects **part**icipating hospital emergenc**y de**partments and remote psychiatric providers, allowing them to share secure electronic health information regarding patient encounters across different EHRs. eid: 2-s2.0-85052719180
5. **Tower of Babel Problem in Telehealth: Addressing the Health Information Exchange Needs of the North Carolina Statewide Telepsychiatry Program (NC-STeP)**
Telepsychiatry is a viable option for providing psychiatric care to those who are **current**ly underserved or who lack access to services. While **the cur**rent technology is adequate for most uses, and continues to advance, there remain barriers to its widespread utilization. One such barrier when working with different healthcare systems is that they utilize different electronic medical record systems (EMRs). This paper describes the experience of the North Carolina Statewide Telepsychiatry Program (NC-STeP) with this problem and how the program successfully resolved it by establishing a web portal that connects **part**icipating hospital emergenc**y de**partments and remote psychiatric providers to share secure electronic health information regarding patient encounters across different EMRs. The Portal also facilitates scheduling, status tracking, and reporting on each patient encounter, as well as delivers the necessary data for the billing to process charges for each consult and to **administr**ators for the operation of the program. The portal effectively bridges the needs of the multiple actors in the telepsychiatry virtual encounter. It provides an efficient experience for the patient and the point-of-care provider, a reliable document exchange for the psychiatric provider, and effective record keeping for the billing and government entities.  2017, Springer Science+Business Medi**a, L**LC, part of Springer Nature. eid: 2-s2.0-85037990118

7. **Australian Men's Hockey Team: Virtually There. Telepsychology in Olympic Sport**
Objective: This article provides a description of a pilot telepsychology programme introduced in the Australian Men's Hockey programme in the lead-up to our gold medal World Cup and Commonwealth Games campaigns in 2014. Method: This article is a case description of a novel application of videoconferencing technology and a reflective practice evaluation of our initial clinical experiences with this technology. Results: Observations and feedback from players and coaches augur well for the acceptability and effectiveness of new technologies in responding to the considerable psychological demands of an increasingly globalised elite sporting context. Despite the usual array of technological challenges, not only did **individu**al sessions become a critical **part** of ensur**ing indi**vidual well-being but group sessions also contributed to team cohesion. Coaching staff also utilised video links to access timely psychological input during tours, and to strengthen multidisciplinary assessments and treatment planning. Conclusions: The successful application of telepsychology with these exceptionally high-functioning clients in a high-stakes context allayed some of the concerns about telepsychology among the coaching and sport science team. This novel application of telepsychology has provided a base from which to explore the use of communication technologies more routinely in our practice and to catch up to the digital natives that are our elite athlete clients.  2015 The Australian Psychological Society. eid: 2-s2.0-84937543878
8. **Informed consent: An adaptable question format for telepsychology**
Building on the work of Pomerantz and Handelsman (2004) and Handelsman and Galvin (1988), this article presents a modern suggested framework for facilitating and enhancing the informed consent process for telepsychology. With the proliferation of mainstream online psychotherapy services across the past decade, new challenges for therapists and clients have emerged. Although the American Psychological Association (2013a) has published **gener**al guidelines for telepsychology practice, clinicians and clients may benefit from a more in-depth, illustrative model from which to develop telepsychology informed consent processes. Like its predecessors, this version contains questions clients have the right to discuss with their psychologists; however, unlike its antecedents, this version is presented as a modular template that can be easily modified to suit practitioners' needs. New, telepsychology-specific questions have been added to address telepsychology training, technological malfunctions, information security, payment, telepsychology laws, and other relevant topics.  2016 American Psychological Association. eid: 2-s2.0-84983762685
9. **Path analytic modeling of psychologists openness to performing clinical work with telepsychology: A national study**
Objective: To examine whether the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) and Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) apply to psychologists openness to using telepsychology. Method: **Part**icipants were 1,791 psychologists **current**ly practicing psychothera**py. **Participants represented all 50 US states and averaged 26.33 (SD = 11.18) years in clinical practice. The study used a cross-sectional, national online design. Results: Path analyses derived from the TRA and TAM evidenced poor fit. A newly-developed, third model achieved adequate to fit in which perceived attitudes of others concerning telepsychology were associated with perceived ease of use ( = 0.25, p <.001) and usefulness ( = 0.30, p <.001) of telepsychology. Perceived ease of use ( = 0.30, p <.001) and usefulness ( = 0.32, p <.001) of telepsychology both uniquely predic**ted cur**rent use of telepsychology. Conclusions: Organizations should adopt methods for delivering telepsychology that are easy to use and possess demonstrable utility.  2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-85071903141
10. **Consultants' use of telepractice: Practitioner survey, issues, and resources**
This article first provides a definition of psychology telepractice, and then introduces the reader to some of the research in the field in **gener**al and to the results from the few studies of technology use in consultation that have been published. We next describe a survey, sanctioned by the Society of Consulting Psychology (SCP), Division 13 of the American Psychological Association (APA), which we designed and conducted to gain an understanding of the nature and level of the consultation telepractices of SCP members with an emphasis on learning about their utilization of technology. Tools for technology, social media, electronic communication, and **analysi**s were assessed. Along with a discussion of the survey findings, we articulate several key telepractice issues and challenges faced by consulting psychologists. Additionally, we introduce the reader to various guidelines for telepractice that have emerged in recent years, including the recently passed APA Guidelines for Telepsychology Practice, that might be **help**ful to applied psychology work.  2014 American Psychological Association. eid: 2-s2.0-84930692064
11. **Prospective acceptance of distinct mobile mental health features in psychiatric patients and mental health professionals**
Background: Despite numerous mobile health (mHealth) applications available, **current** impact on mental healthcare is low. Users face overwhelming variety of applications and sensors. Evidence for distinct features' effectiveness is largely lacking. Along with technical feasibility and data security issues, readiness and preferences of patients predetermine engagement and impact of mHealth in psychiatry. Objective: We aimed to assess the prospective attitudes of psychiatric patients and mental health professionals (MHP) towards mHealth applications in **gener**al and with regard to distinct features. Methods: We conducted a survey entailing 486 subjects (297 MHP and 189 patients). Results: Professionals and patients indicate both, considerable acceptance and rejection for most features. Marked concerns across groups relate to data security** in g**eneral. Actimetry and geotracking were considered **part**icularly skeptical. **Import**antly, most patients prefer to be prompted timely about health status changes. Conclusion: Altogether, evidence indicates substantial support for mHealth features in mental healthcare despite considerable rejection of distinct features. We conclude that tighter collaboration between researchers, developers and clinicians must address matching mHealth-apps to patients' needs. Improved information on potential risks and possibilities associated with mHealth features is strongly indicated in MHP and psychiatric patients in order to reach an appropriately informed decision on **individu**al involvement.  2018 Elsevier Ltd eid: 2-s2.0-85059267634

The use of telepsychology technology to deliver psychological services to geographically dispersed and isolated populations is on the rise. The increasing use of technology has not necessarily been accompanied by an enhancement in technology instruction by psychology training programs. A model of doctoral training is offered that integrates telepsychology technology throughout its curriculum, training, and program **administr**ation.

13. **The case of telepsychiatry adoption and diffusion in a healthcare organization in New Zealand**
This research investigated telemedicine adoption and usage in psychiatry in one hospital in New Zealand (NZ). This research utilized the technological innovations theories as a guiding theoretical framework to develop a set of determinants of telemedicine adoption in healthcare organizations. The research looked at two stages in the case study concerning the adoption process of telemedicine, utilizing the video conferencing technology (TMVC). Prior to TMVC adoption, the findings suggested that TMVC was adopted according to its relative advantage and cost effectiveness, along with other facilitating factors such as image enhancement. None of the deterringfactors seemed to impede the adoption decision of TMVC. Results from the post-adoption stage suggested that TMVC was used minimally in the case study. The superficial assessment of **import**ant factors such as complexity and compatibility, prior to TMVC adoption, further suggested this weakness. In comparison with the literature, the incompatibility of TMVC in psychiatry stood as a unique cultural identifier pertaining to TMVC adoption in the NZ case study.

14. **Computer-supported distance art therapy: A focus on traumatic illness**
We propose computer-supported distance art therapy as an innovative and inexpensive form of telehealth, and present a rationale for developing distance art therapy services for people with traumatic illnesses. The rationale is based on four **current** trends: (a) the aging of the population, (b) a shift in focus in the field of telehealth, (c) an increase inpsychosocial treatments for people with traumatic physical illnesses, and (d) the recent burgeoning of the art and healing movement. Forms of telehealth such as computer-supported distance art therapy have both a technical and a human dimension, which need to be developed in parallel. Our process of **part**icipatory development and initial feasibility assessment **was **part of a cross-disciplinary collaboration involving the two authors (an artist/counselor and a computer scientist**) an**d a participatory design team of ten others.  2002 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

15. **Special online consulting for patients with eating disorders and their relatives: Analysis of user characteristics and e-mail content**
In the treatment of chronic diseases, programs that use the internet as a medium are becoming more and more **import**ant as a complement to classical intervention techniques. Since 1998, a non-profit information and online consulting service for patients with eating disorders and their friends and relatives (www.ab-server.de) has existed. This was established by members of the Deutsche Forschungsinitiative Essstrungen e.V. (DFE) [German Research Initiative for Eating Disorders] and members of the Clinic of Psychiatry, University of Leipzig, Germany. For the present study, 2,176 e-mail requests from users of the online consultation service were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively in order to better understand the differences between different types and groups of users. The **analysi**s was related to the social field of the person requesting the consultation, the type of disorder reported, and the content of the e-mail request. Three main user groups could be identified: people who described themselves as having an eating disorder (57.2%), people who were related socially to the affected person (32.4%), and interested persons (9.8%). The consulting service was predominantly used by persons suffering from bulimia nervosa or their families and friends (63.1%). One third (33.3%) of the posted e-mails were related to **behavior**al patterns in dealing with the illness and the affected person. They were followed by inquiries for information about the disease (18.7%) and by those seeking **help** in finding specialized clinics/therapists and places in therapies. The increasing use of the online consulting service indicates that there is a substantial need for information **and **help in persons with eating disorders and in their relatives, who are able to easily contact professionals using this online service. Online consulting has a high potential for complementary care of affected people.  Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-33847724788
16. **Psychological online consultation service attracts men: A new approach to close the gap between being ill and being treated**
Background: Since 1999, the University Hospital Zurich (Zurich, Switzerland) has offered an e-mail-based consultation service for **individu**al health concerns where anonymous questions can be asked to an online doctor. This study aimed at the characterization of the user profile, the content of the question, and the answers given specific in the field of psychiatry. Materials and Methods: In total, 3,148 questions were asked from 2008 to 2010. Of these, 209 (6.6%) requests were selected by International Classification of Diseases-10 and International Classification of Primary Care codes relevant for psychiatry and included in the retrospective qualitative study. The content **analysi**s of the requests was supported by means of the Mayring inductive category system using a professional t**ext ana**lysis program (MAXQDA). Results: Of the users, 45.9% were female, and 46.9% were male. The mean age was 37.4 years. The main topics of the request were somatoform, somatization, and hypochondriac disorders in 18.4%, **behavior**al syndromes in 17.9%, and mood disorders in 15.4%. The reason stated most frequently for using the service was looking for a second opinion. The doctors responded with detailed information about disease and treatment and in 70.8% recommended consultation of a physician. Conclusions: Telemedicine is suggested to empower patients by developing health literacy with professional advice. The gender ratio of the users is almost equal, although the prevalence of psychological diseases in the **gener**al population is higher in women than in men. Psychological online consultation may potentially reach mentally **ill indi**viduals who do not have or did not seek professional **help** yet, and it seems to be especially attractive for men.  2015, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-84921509769
17. **Readiness of health-care institutions in KwaZulu-Natal to implement telepsychiatry**
We assessed the preparedness of health districts and designated hospitals in the KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) province for proposed telepsychiatry services. An e-health readiness questionnaire for developing countries was administered to managers of health districts and managers of designated psychiatric hospitals by telephone interview. Ten of the 11 district managers and managers/medical officers of 45 of 58 designated hospitals were interviewed. Notwithstanding some concerns regarding the tool, low levels of e-health readiness were found. District managers recorded e-health readiness scores of 137-217 out of 300. This was similar to the hospital managers, who recorded readiness scores of 121-260 out of 300. For telepsychiatry to succeed in KZN, an awareness programme will be required to facilitate the necessary change management. eid: 2-s2.0-84859705054
18. **An analysis of telepsychiatry programs from an organizational perspective**
Employing telecommunication tools to deliver **behavior**al health services over a distance, referred to as telepsychiatry, is a technique that has been around since the 1950s. With more than 40 formally recognized active telepsychiatry programs, ample published studies have documented the technical feasibility and apparent satisfaction and acceptance by patients and providers. However, there has been minimal **analysi**s regarding the formal programs delivering these services. This study collected data from 16 programs recognized as among the most active in the world. The results indicate a dearth of strategic business plans for the provision of telepsychiatry services; a focus on patient services above all and; the potential for telepsychiatry to eventually meld into the everyday practice of psychiatrists and psychologists. eid: 2-s2.0-0034527826
19. **Coping, productive time use, and negative mood among adults with severe mental illness: A daily diary study**
Most studies on coping among persons with severe mental illness have relied on retrospective self-report methods; a limitation of this methodology is susceptibility to recall bias. The purpose of the present investigation was to expand the **current** understanding of the impact of coping among persons with severe mental illness by examining coping strategies, mood, and social functioning (operationalized as productive time use) using a daily process design. Twenty-seven adults diagnosed with severe mental illness completed baseline clinical interviews and up to 20 days of nightly telephone interviews addressing coping and daily life. A total of 198 coping efforts were reported for 387 days. Mixed-effects regression analyses examined the association between type of daily coping strategy (problem-centered, neutral, or avoidant) and both daily proportion of time **part**icipants spent in productive activity and daily negative mood, controlling for demographic and clinical variables. The results indicated that productive time use was significantly lower on days when avoidant strategies were used, in contrast with days when problem-centered strategies and neutral strategies were used. There was no significant main effect of coping on negative mood, although there was a trend in the expected direction. Findings support the hypothesis that the types of coping strategies adults with severe mental illness use are related to better social functioning on a daily level.  2010 Elsevier B.V. eid: 2-s2.0-78249245684
20. **Feasibility and promise of a remote-delivered preconception motivational interviewing intervention to reduce risk for alcohol-exposed pregnancy**
Background: Alcohol-exposed pregnancy (AEP) is a leading cause of birth defects. Effective face-to-face preconception interventions based on motivational interviewing (MI) exist and should be translated into remote formats for maximum public health impact. This study investigated the feasibility and promise of a one-session, remote-delivered, preconception, MI-based AEP intervention (EARLY Remote) for non-treatment-seeking community women. Subjects and Methods: This was a single-arm, prospective pilot intervention study. All **part**icipants received the intervention via telephone and mail. Feasibility of remote-delivery methods, treatment engagement, treatment credibility, MI treatment integrity, and therapeutic alliance were examined. Outcomes were 3- and 6-month drinks per drinking day (DDD), rate of unreliable contraception, and proportion of women at risk for AEP due to continued risk drinking and no or unreliable contraception use. Results: Feasibility of remote delivery was establish**ed; **participants were engaged by the intervention and rated it as credible. Integrity to MI and therapeutic alliance were good. Both DDD and rate of unreliable contraception decreased significantly over time. Proportions of women who drank at risk levels, used unreliable or no contraception, and/or were at risk for AEP in the past 90 days decreased significantly from baseline to 6 months. Conclusions: Remote delivery was feasible, and the translated remote intervention may reduce AEP risk. Refinement of EARLY Remote may facilitate its placement within a spectrum of effective MI-based preconception AEP intervent**ions** as part of a stepped-care approach. EARLY Remote may have an **import**ant role within a stepped-care model for dissemination to geographically disperse women at risk for AEP. This could result in substantial public health impact through reduction of AEP on a larger scale.  Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-84899780736
21. **'SMS' for mental health - Feasibility and acceptability of using text messages for mental health promotion among young women from urban low income settings in India**
Objective: The **current** study assesses the acceptability and feasibility of mobile text messages for promoting positive mental health and as a **help**line among young women in urban slums of Bangalore. Methodology: Forty girls in the age range of 16-18 years from urban slums received messages every day for a month. They could call or message back or give a 'missed call' to the same number whenever they had emotional problems or felt like talking to a counselor. The received responses in the form of return texts, missed calls and return phone calls were recorded. Feedback about the feasibility and acceptability of the mobile messages was collected after a month. Results: 25 out of 40 (62.5%) **part**icipants called back, asking for mental health services and to say they felt good about the messages. 23 of 40 (57.5%) messaged back regarding their feelings. 62% reported that they felt supported with the mental health messages. Male family members of nearly half of **the **participants called back to check the authenticity of the source. Most women did not face any problems because of the messages. Conclusion: This pilot qualitative study indicates that mobile text messages are a feasible and culturally acceptable method for mental health promotion and prevention among young women from urban slums in India. Issues such as consent from the woman and family, ensuring confidentiality and providing authentic and reliable support services, need to be taken into account before attempting to scale up such a s**ervi**ce, particularly in vulnerable groups.  2014 Elsevier B.V. eid: 2-s2.0-84912031259
22. **E-mail therapy for anorexia nervosa: Prospects and limitations**
Demographic and clinical characteristics indicate high acceptance of e-mail by outpatients with anorexia nervosa. Patients report that frequent e-mail contact provides them with the experience of greater contact with their clinicians and requires them to be more attentive to therapeutic tasks. Routine logs of calorie counts and symptoms may be communicated by e-mail on a frequent basis, freeing up office time for better discussions. Informal investigations in a case series of outpatients with anorexia nervosa suggest that e-mail can offer a useful adjunct to treatment. No adverse consequences have been experienced. Clinicians using e-mail in this fashion must attend to legal and ethical concerns about e-mail communication.

23. **Teleconsultation and Training of VHA Providers on Transgender Care: Implementation of a Multisite Hub System**
Background: The Veterans Health **Administr**ation (VHA) is piloting a national program providing **teleconsult**ation and training to clinicians to increase knowledge and comfort with treating transgender veterans and to expand clinical capacity. This program is based on Project ECHO and uses specialist expertise to train and educate front-line clinicians. Over time, the front-line clinicians increase knowledge and skills, enabling them to provide care locally and obviate need for patient travel. This program is innovative in its national scope, interdisciplinary team model, and multihub structure. This article describes development of the program and initial results for the first cohort of learners. Materials and Methods: Five interdisciplinary clinical teams **part**icipated in the 14-session, 7-month program. Most teams had some experience treating transgender veterans prior** to **participation. Results: The teams completed at least 12 of 14 sessions. Thirtee**n of** 33 participants completed an evaluation. In **gener**al, respondents found **the telecon**sultation program very **help**ful and credited the experience with improving their team functioning. Furthermore, respondents reported a significant increase in confidence to treat transgender veterans by the end of the program (59% versus 83%). We explored whether it is possible to recruit VHA clinic**al t**eams to participate in lengthy training on a low prevalence but complex condition. Conclusions: Early results support the feasibility and effectiveness of this natio**nal VHA tel**econsultation and training program for transgender care. Lessons learned from the first group of learners have been applied to two con**current** groups with positive results.  Copyright 2015, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2015. eid: 2-s2.0-84948766201
24. **A Survey of Telepsychiatry in the USA**
Active telepsychiatry services in the United States were surveyed. Telepsychiatry was being used in four broad areas: educational, **administr**ative, research, and clinical. Of the five telepsychiatry sites with accurate patient contact data, there was a mean of 1.35 patient contacts per week. The majority of telepsychiatry usage involved direct physician-patient contact. No adverse outcomes to patients were reported.  1995, SAGE Publications. All rights reserved. eid: 2-s2.0-0029418551
25. **The use of telepsychiatry in the brief counselling of non-psychotic patients from an inner-London general practice**
Brief counselling of 13 non-psychotic patients was carried out using an interactive television link, in order to assess patient satisfaction with this technique. Informed consent was obtained from all patients before the videoconferencing sessions, which were conducted at 128 kbit/s. Over the four-month study period, 11 men and two women **part**icipated in a total of 29 sessions. A total of 28 questionnaires were completed. After the sessions, 93% of patients agreed that they would like to use this medium for communication again, 75% stated that they were able to see everything that they needed to see and 86% agreed that they were able to hear everything they needed to hear. Overall, these findings indicate that patients were happy with the standard of care they received. eid: 2-s2.0-2842511204
26. **A description of Telemental Health Services provided by the Veterans Health Administration in 2006-2010**
Objective: This is the first large-scale study to describe the types of telemental health services provided by the Veterans Health **Administr**ation (VHA). Methods: The authors compiled national-level **VHA admin**istrative data for fiscal years 2006-2010 (October 1, 2005, to September 30, 2010). Telemental health encounters were identified by VHA and U.S. De**part**ment of Veterans Affairs stop codes and categorized as medication management, **individu**al psychotherapy with or without medication management, group psychotherapy, and diagnostic assessment. Results: A total of 342,288 telemental health encounters were identified, and each type increased substantially across the five years. Telepsychotherapy with medication management was the fastest growing type of telemental health service. Conclusions: The use of videoconferencing technology has expanded beyond medication management alone to include telepsychotherapy services, including b**oth indi**vidual and group psychotherapy, and diagnostic assessments. The increase in telemental health services is encouraging, given the large number of returning veterans living in rural areas. eid: 2-s2.0-84870015766
27. **A qualitative study of young people's perspectives on receiving psychiatric services via televideo**
Objective: It is critical to consult young people about their experiences. This study addresses the paucity of research on the perspective of young people in **gener**al, and in paediatric telepsychiatry specifically. The goal is to understand the experience of young people receiving telepsychiatry. Method: Interpretive interactionism (Denzin, 1989) was used to interview 30 young people; immediately following the consultation and four to six weeks later. **Analysi**s occurred via a series of steps in keeping with the interpretive interactionist framework. Results: Four themes arose repeatedly: the encounter with the psychiatrist and experience of having others in the room; the **help**fulness of the session; a sense of personal choice during the consultation; and, the technology. **Part**icipants highlighted the **import**ance of their relationship with the psychiatri**st. **Participant's narratives were replete with examples of ways that they actively took responsibility and exerted control within the session itself. Conclusion: Young people have a significant role to play in their own care. It is critical that telepsychiatry recommendations be explained and opportunities for young people to express their concerns and discuss alternatives are provided. Further efforts to include young people may include ensuring offering alternate treatments and/or negotiated when recommended treatments are unacceptable and/or resisted. eid: 2-s2.0-77949602145
28. **Applying mobile technologies to mental health service delivery in South Asia**
Mobile phones have increasingly assumed an **import**ant role in the treatment of mental disorders in high-income countries. This paper considers such possibilities in the South Asian context. First, a brief review of mobile phone use in mental disorders is provided. Next, data on the market penetration and dissemination of mobile phones in South Asia is presented. Finally, common barriers to treatment for mental disorders in South Asia are evaluated against solutions that could be derived from mobile technologies. Though not without their risks, mobile phones have the potential to increase engagement, treatment, and retention of South Asian patients with mental disorders in unprecedented ways.  2012 Elsevier B.V. eid: 2-s2.0-84866153860
29. **Videoconferencing in psychiatry: A survey of use in northern Norway**
A survey of the use of videoconferencing in mental health care was carried out in northern Norway. A questionnaire was distributed to all user institutions in northern Norway at the same time that ISDN became available, in mid-1995. The questionnaire completion rate for locations recorded as **part**icipants in videoconferencing sessions was 62%. Within six months, a total of 1028 persons **had **participated in 140 videoconferencing sessions from 35 institutions. The purposes of videoconferencing included meetings (50%), supervision, training and teaching (31%), clinical consultations (14%) and tests or demonstrations (5%). The alternative forms of contact which videoconferencing replaced included travel (59%), no contact (25%), telephone (14%), and mail or fax (2%). No problems were reported in 55% of the sessions; in 19% there were audio problems, in 14% there were picture problems, in 5% attempts to connect failed and in 5% disconnection occurred. The majority of users (87%) reported that they were satisfied or very satisfied with the facility; 8% were uncertain and 5% were less satisfied or totally dissatisfied. Continued surveying will provide longitudinal data on the diffusion of telepsychiatry in northern Norway. eid: 2-s2.0-0030322261
30. **The use of videoconferencing for telepsychiatry in Finland**
Some of the first telepsychiatry experiments in Finland were carried out at the De**part**ment of Psychiatry of the University of Oulu, where videoconferencing has been used for family therapy, occupational counselling, consultation and teaching. In 1996 videoconferencing was used for a total of 249 hours, which increased to 434 hours in 1997. During 1997, 45% of the time was used for teaching, 26% for occupational counselling, consultations and therapies, 23% for training and 6% for **administr**ation (mainly testing the connections). In a survey,** 37 **participants rated aspects of the quality of the videoconferences on a scale from 4 (poor) to 10 (excellent). The audio quality had a mean value of 8.0 (SD 0.9), the picture quality 7.5 (SD 1.5), and the **gener**al value of the videoconference was rated 7.5 (SD 1.0). Preliminary results with telepsychiatry in Finland have been promising. Interactive videoconferencing provides an easy, fast and relatively inexpensive method of providing psychiatric services over long distances. eid: 2-s2.0-0032248366
31. **A mobile phone program to track young people's experiences of mood, stress and coping**
Background: Research examining adolescent mood, stresses, and coping has tended to use retrospective questionnaires which are affected by recall biases. The aim of this study was to develop, pilot, and evaluate a youth-friendly mobile phone program to monitor, in real-time, young people's everyday experiences of mood, stress, and their coping behaviours. Method and design: A momentary sampling program was designed for mobile phones, and ran for 7 days, administering a brief questionnaire four random times each day, capturing information on **current** activity, mood, responses to negative mood, stresses, alcohol and cannabis use. Eleven high school students reviewed the program in focus groups, and 18 students completed 7 days of monitoring. Results: Engagement with the mobile type program was high with 76% of 504 possible entries completed and 94% (17/18) of the **part**icipants reporting that the program adequately captured their moods, thoughts, and activities. The mobiletype program captured meaningful and analyzable data on the way young people's moods, stresses, coping strategies, and alcohol and cannabis use, vary both between and within **individu**als. Conclusions: The mobile type program captured a range of detailed and interesting qualitative and quantitative data about young people's everyday mood, stresses, responses, and **gener**al functioning.

32. **Evaluation of Telepsychiatry-Enabled Perinatal Integrated Care**
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this article is to describe the implementation of the first known telepsychiatry-enabled model of perinatal integrated care and to report initial results following implementation. METHODS: **Behavior**al health screening data were collected from 712 patients at an urban women's clinic, and a more in-depth set of process and outcome measures, including treatment engagement, services utilized, and delivery and post**part**um patient outcomes, was collected from 135 patients referred **for beha**vioral health services. Using nationally published metrics to provide context, the authors applied a descriptive design to evaluate and conduct analyses of program outcomes. RESULTS: The telehealth-enabled integrated care model was successfully implemented within a specialty obstetrics practice. Identification and treat**ment of **behavioral health issues exceeded nationally published rates. The model was also associated with positive indices related to birth weight and br**eastfeed**ing behavior. CONCLUSIONS: These initial results point to telepsychiatry as an effective tool for expanding perinatal integrated care and lay the foundation for further study and model refinement. The results also add to the growing body of evidence for the use of telepsychiatry-supported integrated care across diverse clinical settings and patient populations. eid: 2-s2.0-85084175503
33. **Evaluating Telehealth Websites for Information Consistent with APA Guidelines for Telepsychology**
The authors evaluated websites offering therapeutic telehealth services (N = 55) using a 38-item checklist based on the American Psychological Associations Guidelines for the Practice of Telepsychology (APA Guidelines) to determine the extent that online service providers included such information on their websites. On average, the websites reviewed addressed only 39% of the checklist criteria. These findings are disconcerting and suggest most providers websites do not include information that would **help** potential clients make informed decisions about online treatment. The authors urge more providers to consider offering telehealth services to increase the supply of qualified providers in response to growing consumer demand.  2019,  2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. eid: 2-s2.0-85076925577
34. **Perspectives of Young Adults on Receiving Telepsychiatry Services in an Urban Early Intervention Program for First-Episode Psychosis: A Cross-Sectional, Descriptive Survey Study**
Background: Limited knowledge exists on telepsychiatry in specialized services for first-episode psychosis (FEP), despite its potential for improving service access and engagement. Objective: To explore access and use of technology, obstacles to attending clinic appointments, and perspectives of young adults with FEP on using telepsychiatry as **part** of outpatient services. Methods: A cross-sectional, descriptive survey study was conducted between July and October 2017 with young adults between the ages of 18 and 38 recruited from a specialized program for FEP in an urban Canadian setting. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and content **analysi**s. Results: Among** 51 **participants (mean age = 26.1, SD = 4.2; 59% male; 20% experiencing housing instability), more than half (59%, n = 30) rarely or never used mainstream video chat (e.g., Facetime). The majority (78%, n = 40) reported obstacles to attending appointments, with several (37%, n = 19) identifying two or more. Almost half (49%, n = 25) were very favorable towards telepsychiatry and a quarter (25%, n = 13) were somewhat fav**orab**le. Participants expressed several concerns about telepsychiatry, including loss of human contact and confidentiality. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is a first study on the perspectives of **individu**als with FEP about telepsychiatry. Despite experiencing obstacles to attending appointments and expressing receptivity towards tele**psyc**hiatry, participants did not have access to these services. It is **import**ant to provide education to clinicians on the potential of telepsychiatry to improve service access. Also, more research is needed on when, where, and how telepsychiatry can be integrated into existing care while addressing patient and clinician concerns.

Objective We analyzed the preference of three psychological intervention formats-**individu**al, group, and online-in a sample of 267 patients with a primary diagnosis of emotional disorder in Spanish public mental health settings. Method We studied patients' preferences considering sociodemographic characteristics, diagnoses, history of psychological treatments, number of sessions, and satisfaction with past interventions. Results Most **part**icipants (85.4%) preferred psychological treatment in** an indi**vidual format, 14.2% in group, and 0.4% online. When comparing the people wh**o chose **individual and group treatment, no demographic or clinical differences were found. The arguments against group format were the lack of privacy and expression difficulties. Regarding online format, these included being considered impersonal and ineffective. Conclusion The rejection of group and online psychotherapy formats allows us to define the actions we should carry out in public mental health settings to improve the acceptance of more costeffective therapy formats.  2019 Osma et al. eid: 2-s2.0-85067042755

0. **Connecting the disconnected: Preliminary results and lessons learned from a telepsychology initiative with special management inmates**
The use of telepsychology, such as videoconferencing (VC) systems, has been rapidly increasing as a tool for the provision of mental health services to underserved clients in difficult to access settings. Inmates detained in restrictive housing appear to be at an increased risk of experiencing emotional and behavioral disturbances compared to their general **popul**ation counterparts, yet they are less likely to receive appropriate treatment due to security constraints. The primary purpose of this article is to describe the process of implementing a novel telepsychology intervention specifically designed to offer group therapy to high-security, administratively segregated inmates. In addition, preliminary results on treatment and therapeutic process outcomes in a sample of 49 participants are reported. Although some evidence indicated that telepsychology was less preferred than in-person sessions, group differences on measures of psychological functioning and criminal thinking were not found across 3 conditions (telepsychology, in-person, and a no-treatment control). Furthermore, a number of limitations associated with program implementation and study design suggest that results be interpreted with caution and should not be used to discount the use of telepsychology as a viable treatment delivery option. Recommendations for future development and **evalu**ation of telepsychological programs are discussed within the context of correctional settings and beyond.

1. **A comparison of psychiatrist evaluation and patient symptom report in a jail telepsychiatry clinic**
The effectiveness of a jail telepsychiatry service was **evalu**ated by comparing psychiatrist and inmate report of psychopathology. Sixty-two inmates completed a total of 107 consultations at a rural county jail via interactive televideo. The inmates completed the **Symptom** Rating Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R), and the psychiatrist completed a Psychiatr**ist E**valuation Form including the Clinical **Global** **Impress**ion Scale-Severity Index (**CGI**) after each **teleconsult**ation. Most inmates were **rate**d mild to **mode**rately ill on **the** CGI. There was a significant, high correlation between telepsych**iatri**st evaluation** on** the CGI and inmate report of over**all sym**ptoms on the SCL-90-R [r(101) = 0.35, p < 0.05]. The findings support the effectiveness of tele**psych**iatric evaluation for the jail **popul**ation.

Forty-five inmates (41 male, 4 female) completed the **Symptom** Rating Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R) on three occasions, once before the **teleconsult**ation and twice during treatment. The psychiatrist completed the Clinical **Global** **Impress**ion Scale - Severity Index (**CGI**) after e**ach telecon**sultation. Forty-nine per cent of inmates were aged under 30 years, 24% were aged between 30 and 39 years, while 27% were aged over 40 years. The inmates' mean SCL-90-R scores decreased over time, indicating less psychiatric distress. The psychiatrist reported patient improvement over time as assessed by **the** CGI.

0. **Psychiatrists' satisfaction with telepsychiatry**
The purpose of this **evalu**ation study was to learn more about psychiatrists' **satisfact**ion with telepsychiatry. Telepsychiatry will succeed only if psychiatrists are satisfied with this service delivery method and offer it to their patients. While telepsychiatry appears to be effective and most patients report that they are satisfied with it, less information is available about factors that lead to psychiatris**ts' satis**faction. We interviewed psychiatrists who treat rural/frontier patients and asked them to describe factors that encouraged or discouraged their use of telepsychiatry. Only 4 were mostly satisfied with telepsychiatry and all offered suggestions for improving this delivery method. Most agreed that it was a hardship for many of their patients to travel 100 to 750 roundtrip miles over a 1-3 day period for a 20-minute consultation and that telepsychiatry could be a lifeline to many of them. Nevertheless, they identified significant technical and interpersonal barriers that discouraged their use of telepsychiatry.  Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-33847757200

We **evalu**ated **client** **satisfact**ion and one-month mental health outcomes for telepsychia**try cl**ients compared with those undergoing a face-to-face psychiatric consul**tation**. Clients were asked to complete an SF-12 health survey before the consultation**, a satis**faction survey after the consultation, and were contacted for a one-month follow-up SF-12 survey by telephone. Forty-eight of the 62 initial responders (77%) were available for contact by telephone after one month. Tel**epsych**iatry clients demonstrated significant improvements on pre- and post-SF-12 mental health measures (t = 3.7; P = 0.001), while there was no change for the in-person group (t = 1.0; P = 0.35).** Telep**sychiatry clients felt that they could present the same information as in person(93%), were satisfied with their session (96%), and were comfortable in their ability to talk (85%); this was simil**ar to **the in-person clients. They reflected slightly lower le**vels of s**atisfaction regarding feeling supported and encouraged** than **did the in-person c**lients**. Both telepsychiatry clients and trad**itiona**l face-to-face psychiatry clients were satisfied with their experience of mental health care service provision, and mental health improvements were evident in the telepsychiatry patients. eid: 2-s2.0-33750686738

The level of **satisfact**ion with telepsychiatry **evalu**ations was determined in a sample of 43 forensic psychiatric patient inmates in a large urban jail. A forensic psychiatrist interviewed 20 patients in person, the other 23 remotely via interactive video. Demographic characteristics, physical health status, and psychiatric symptom seventy on the Global Severity Index of the Brief Symptom Inventory were comparable in the two groups.

3. **Telehealth service delivery for persons with alcoholism**
Videoconferencing at a bandwidth of 384 kbit/s was used in open sessions for subjects with alcohol use disorders (AUD). Study participants received eight sessions of group therapy over a four-week period from an accredited addictions counsellor. Outcome assessment included self-report measures, a qualitative interview and a chart review. Of the 18 subjects who started the study, 14 attended at least four sessions of therapy, completed self-report assessments and the thematic interview. The participants reported high levels of **satisfact**ion with telepsychiatry, found the intervention to be highly credible, had good session attendance and attrition comparable to that expected with conventional same-room treatment. In all, 82% of subjects reported that they would recommend the service to a friend or family member. The results demonstrate the feasibility of using videoconferencing for service delivery to adults with AUD, and encourage the future performance of randomized controlled trials. eid: 2-s2.0-31544443531
4. **Client satisfaction in a feasibility study comparing face-to-face interviews with telepsychiatry**
We carried out a pilot study comparing **satisfact**ion levels between psychiatric patients seen face to face (FTF) and those seen via videoconference. Patients who consented were randomly assigned to one of two groups. One group received services in person (FTF from the visiting psychiatrist) while the other was seen using videoconferencing at 128 kbit/s. One psychiatrist provided all the FTF and videoconferencing assessment and follow-up visits. A total of 24 subjects were recruited. Three of the subjects (13%) did not attend their appointments and two subjects in each group were lost to follow-up. Thus there were nine in the FTF group and eight in the videoconferencing group. The two groups were similar in most respects. Pati**ent satis**faction with the services was assessed using the** **Client** S**atisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8), completed four months after the initial consultation. The mean scores were 25.3 in the FTF group and 21.6 in the videoconferencing group. Although there was a trend in favour of the FTF service, the difference was not significa**nt. Patie**nt satisfaction is only one component of **evalu**ation. The efficacy of telepsychiatry must also be measured relative to that of conventional, FTF care before policy makers can decide how extensively telepsychiatry should be implemented.  2002, Royal Society of Medicine Press Limited.

5. **Disagreement in satisfaction between patients and providers in the use of videoconferences by depressed adults**
Aim: To **evalu**ate whether there was a difference in **satisfact**ion scores between providers and patients in the use of videoconferences (VCs) by depressed adults. Method: This study was a subanalysis of the joint European project, MasterMind, and participants were recruited from 15 **pilot studi**es in 11 different countries. The Cli**ent Satis**faction Questionnaire (CSQ)-3 was used as assessment tool, and scores were summed to give total scores. The questionnaire consists of three it**ems e**valuating **general s**atisfaction, fulfillment of needs in treatment, and usability. Results: A total of 362 respondents, 201 patients and 161 providers, completed the questionnaire. Providers had a mean total CSQ-3 score of 9.17 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 8.90-9.45), whereas patients had a mean of 9.70 (95% CI = 9.44-9.98). Mean scores for item 1 (the extent to which VCs had met the needs of the participants): Patients 3.19, providers 2.93 (p = 0.00048); for item** 2 (gener**al satisfaction): Patients 3.22, providers 3.08 (p = 0.083); and item 3 (whether participants wanted to use VCs again): Patients 3.28 providers 3.16 (p = 0.045). Conclusion: The results sh**owed that** total satisfaction scores were higher in patients than in providers. The differences between patients and providers were significant for items 1 and 3 (p < 0.05), but we did not find a significant difference regarding item 2.  2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-85084654748

0. **Use of Reimbursed Psychology Videoconference Services in Australia After Their Introduction: An Investigation Using Administrative Data**
Background: In November 2017, the Australian government approved reimbursement for psychology consultations conducted by videoconference under the Better Access **initi**ative to address inequitable access of **mental health servic**es across regions in Australia. Objective: This project uses publically available activity data from the Medicare Benefits Scheme to quantify the uptake of videoconference for psychology resulting from **the i**nitiative change. Methods: Data were extracted from the Medicare Benefits Schedule item reports using the item codes for standard consultations and the new item codes for videoconference consultations. Activity data from 2 years before and the first year of the change to the Better** Acce**ss initiative were compared to examine the uptake of videoconference for psychology. Data were stratified by allied health profession, sex, age and state jurisdiction. Results: In the 1-year **period** after the introduction of reimbursed videoconference consultations, approximately 5.7 million in-person consultations and 4141 videoconference consultations were funded by Medicare in Australia. Videoconference consultations comprised 0.07% of the total consultations performed in that 1-y**ear pe**riod and showed an increased trajectory. The results can guide future research into **evalu**ating the clinical outcomes of patients via both in-person and videoconference delivery modes. Conclusions: Videoconfere**nce mental health se**rvices were used in the first year that they were available, although they only accounted for a small percentage of all mental health consultations provided by allied health professionals. This finding lays the foundation for future work which could examine the effectiveness of the scheme in reducing inequity and investigating the economic benefits of t**he ex**panded initiative to the government and society.  2019 ISPORThe professional society for health economics and outcomes research eid: 2-s2.0-85073756466

This article describes how one large correctional mental health system modified its traditional methods of providing services at remote **rural** prisons. It describes the system as it existed in the more traditional mode, then describes the transition to using more telepsychiatry/ psychology and fewer on-site clinics. It also reports on a staff opinion survey of both the on-site and remote telepsych clinics. Finally, it provides recommendations and a checklist that can assist others who may be deciding to use combination methods of on-site and telepsychiatry in their prison systems.  2000, National Commission on Correctional Health Care.

2. **Telepsychiatry in Polish patients' and doctors' opinion**
BACKGROUND: Telepsychiatry is a new method of medical care, using modern communication technologies and electronic informations. It consists of web pages, containing data about diseases and their treatment in the form of multimedia libraries with video- and audiobooks. This research concerns verification of knowledge and attitude to telepsychiatry amongst patients and psychiatrists.SUBJECTS AND METHODS: An anonymous survey was conducted amongst 105 psychiatrists aged 26-74, including 74 women and 31 men and 102 patients aged 21-79, including 61 women and 41 men.RESULTS: Research reveals that majority of patients never met with the concept of 'telepsychiatry' and do not know what it means. However, more than 50% of respondents answered positively to every question considering the utility of telepsychiatry. Furthermore according to 18% it is possible to replace eye-to-eye conversation by videoconferencing. Only 15% of doctors claim to have an extensive knowledge on telepsychiatry, and 10% do not know what it means. The vast majority of physicians perceive positive aspects of this method of medical care, but 63% would not want general insertion of telepsychiatry. Doctors are apprehensive of losing personal data and medical confidentiality, and of the necessity of legal changes as well.CONCLUSION: The obtained results allow us to conclude that Polish patients and doctors, regardless of their knowledge, age, gender or disease, perceive advantages of telepsychiatry. In connection with this, implementing this method into the Polish medical market makes sense and is in accordance with both patients' and doctors' opinion. Based on our research, we confirmed that there is a necessity of wider popularization of telepsychiatry in Polish therapeutics. eid: 2-s2.0-84952775808
3. **Community based telepsychiatry service for older adults residing in a rural and remote region- utilization pattern and satisfaction among stakeholders**
Background: **Evalu**ation of telepsychiatry (via videoconference) for older adults is mostly focussed on nursing homes or inpatients.** We e**valuated the role of a community based program for older adults in **rural** and remote regions of South Australia. Method: The utilization pattern was studied using retrospective chart review of telepsychiatry assessments over 24 months (2010-2011). **Satisfact****ion w**as evaluated through prospective post-consultation feedback (using a 5-point Likert scale), from patients, community based clinicians and psychiatrist participating in consecutive assessments from April-November 2012. Descriptive analysis was used for the utilization. Mean scores and proportions were calculated for the feedback. Mann Whitney U test was used to compare patient subgroups based on age, gender, prior exposure to telepsychiatry services and inpatient/ outpatient status. Feedback comments were analysed for emerging themes. Results: On retrospective review of 134 consults, mean age was 75.89 years (SD 7.55), 60.4% (81) were females, and 71.6% (96) lived independently. Patients had a broad range of psychiatric disorders, from mood disorders to delirium and dementia, with co-morbid medical illness in 83.5% (112). **On fe**edback evaluation (N = 98), mean scores ranged from 3.88-4.41 for patients, 4.36-4.73 for clinicians and 3.67-4.45 for psychiatrists. Feedback from inpatients (14 out of 37) was significantly lower compared to outpatients (37 out of 61) (chi sq. = 0.808, p < 0.05), and they were significantly less satisfied with the wait time (U = 163.0, p < 0.05) and visual clarity (U = 160.5, p < 0.05). Audio clarity was the most common aspect of** dissatis**faction (mean score less than 3) among patients (6, 11%). Psychiatrists reported a preference for telepsychiatry over face to face in 55.4% (46) assessments. However, they expressed discomfort in situations of cognitive or sensory disabilities in patients. Conclusions:** In r**ural and remote areas, community-based telepsychiatry program can be a useful adjunct for psychiatrist input in the care of older adults. Innovations to overcome sensory deficits and collaboration with community services should be explored to improve its acceptance among the most vulnerable population.  2018 The Author(s). eid: 2-s2.0-85054051128
4. **Rural Status, Suicide Ideation, and Telemental Health: Risk Assessment in a Clinical Sample**
Objective: Individuals living in **rural** areas die by suicide at higher rates than those living in metropolitan areas. Telemental health interventions prov**ide r**ural residing individuals with access to needed care. Identifying telemental health clients at risk for suicide is an important task for clinicians and policymakers. This study **evalu**ated to what** degr**ee rural status and other demographic variables predicted suicide ideation in clients seeking services at a telemental health clinic. Methods: Study participants included 457 low-income clients residing in the medically underserved, geographically diverse Brazos Valley region of Texas. Clients completed the patient health questionnaire during their **initi**al counseling appointment, which assessed **depress**ion severity and suicide ideation in the 2 weeks prior to assessment. Results: Suicide ideation was common among telemental health clients, with approximately 40% of clients in all demographic groups reporting some recent thoughts of suicide. Rates of suicide ideation did not significantly differ by geographic desig**natio**n (ie, rural/metropolitan status), gender, or race/ethnicity. Howev**er, dep**ression was a strong predictor of recent suicide ideation. Conclusions: Telemental health programs can effectively connect **clini**cians with rural residing clients who are otherwise isolated from health care services. However, clinicians working in high-need, historically underserved areas should be prepared to encounter a high prevalence of suicide ideat**ion and** depression. In these regions, clinical and diagnostic features may be better indicators of suicide ideation than demographic variab**les. ** 2018 National Rural Health Association eid: 2-s2.0-85063445623
5. **School-Based Telepsychiatry in an Urban Setting: Efficiency and Satisfaction with Care**
Background and Introduction: Given the shortage of child psychiatrists in most areas, telepsychiatry may increase accessibility of psychiatric care in schools, in part by improving psychiatrists' efficiency and reach. The current study assessed consumer and provider **satisfact**ion with school-based telepsychiatry versus in-person sessions in 25 urban public schools and compared the efficiency of these service delivery models. Materials and Methods: In total, **714 satis**faction surveys were completed by parents, students, school clinicians, and child psychiatrists following **initi**al (26.3%) and follow-up (67.2%) visits (6.4% did not indicate type of visit). Most of these surveyed visits were for medication management (69.9%)** or i**nitiation of medication (22%). Efficiency analyses compared time saved via telepsychiatry versus in-person care. Researchers also conducted focus groups with providers to clarify preferences and concerns about telepsychiatry versus in-person visits. Results: Consumers were highly satisfied with both in-person and telepsychiatry-provided school psychiatry services and showed no significant differences in preference. Providers reported both in-person and telepsychiatry were equally effective and showed a slight preference for in-person sessions, citing concerns about ease of video equipment use. Telepsychiatry services were more efficient than in-person services, as commute/setup occupied about 28 psychiatrist hours total per month. Discussion and Conclusions: Findings suggest that students, parents, and school clinicians perceive school-based telepsychiatry positively and equal to on-site care. Child psychiatrists have apprehension about using equipment, so equipment training/preparation and provision of technical **support** are needed. Implications of study findings for telepsychiatry training and implementation in schools are discussed.  2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2020. eid: 2-s2.0-85077861024
6. **Reaching rural Ohio with intellectual disability psychiatry**
Individuals with intellectual disability experience higher rates of mental illness when compared with the general population, and there is a lack of medical and mental health professionals in **rural** and under-served areas. With the increase in discharge of individuals from institutional settings back to their home communities into the least restrictive environments, there are more patients with complex needs being added to the schedules of physicians in the outpatient delivery care system. Patients with disabilities may not travel well or tolerate changes in routine so may not have access to psychiatry. Utilization of telepsychiatry is well suited to this specialized patient population because it allows a highly traumatized group to meet with a psychiatrist and other mental health professionals from a location of their choice. Ohios Telepsychiatry Project for Intellectual Disability was **initi**ated in 2012 to serve outlying communities with a lack of infrastructure and resources, to provide specialized **mental health servic**es to individuals with co-occurring mental illness and intellectual disability. After five years, over 900 patients with intellectual disability from 64 of Ohios 88 counties receive specialized mental health treatment through this statewide grant-funded project.  2017, The Author(s) 2017. eid: 2-s2.0-85029819907
7. **AiRCare: A Naturalistic Evaluation of the Effectiveness of a Protracted Telephone-Based Recovery Assistance Program on Continuing Care Outcomes**
Background & Objective Substance use disorder treatments are increasingly being contextualized within a disease management framework. Within this context, there is an identified need to maintain patients in treatment for longer **period**s of time in order to help them learn how to manage their disease. One way to meet this need is through telephone-based interventions that engage patients, and include more active outreach attempts and involvement of the patient's family. This study sought to **evalu**ate the effectiveness of three formats of an intensive 12-month post-discharge telephone-based case management approach (AiRCare) on adherence to continuing care plans and substance use outcomes. Methods Data were abstracted from electronic medical records for 379 patients (59.9% male) discharged from a residential treatment program located in the southwestern U.S. from 2013 to 2015. Patients were categorized into one of three groups and received telephone contacts based on their self-selection upon admission to residential treatment (i.e., patient only, family only, and both patient and family). Outcome variables included re-engagement and re-admission rates, quality of life, abstinence rates at 6 and 12 months, and compliance with continuing care plans. Results & Conclusions Favorable short- and long-term outcomes were found for the majority of patients, irrespective of case management group. There appeared to be some value in the addition of family contacts to patient contacts with respect to reducing risk for 12-month re-admission to residential care. These positive but preliminary indications of the effectiveness of AiRCare require replication in a well-powered, randomized controlled trial.  2016 Elsevier Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-84993969530
8. **Women's use of online resources and acceptance of e-mental health tools during the perinatal period**
Objectives The women's professional help-seeking rate for perinatal **depress**ion is low, despite the prevalent and disabling nature of this condition. Therefore, new approaches should be implemented to increase women's access and utilization of treatment resources, namely e-mental health tools. This study aimed to characterize women's current pattern of use of online resources for mental heal issues and women's acceptance of e-mental health tools during the perinatal **period**, and to investigate its main determinants. Methods This study used an online cross-sectional survey that was completed by 546 women during the perina**tal pe**riod. Results 31.3% had prior knowledge of websites targeting mental health illness. Women presenting an actual need for help (i.e., a positive screen **for dep**ression) reported greater use of online resources and greater engagement in e-health behaviors related to mental health (d=0.460.61), and being more accepting of e-mental health tools, particularly of informative websites. Women's perceptions concerning the e-mental tools were found to predict their intentions to use them. Conclusions The results seem to globally **support** Portuguese women's acceptance of e-mental health tools. To improve the level of acceptance, women should be involved as stakeholders in the development of new e-mental health tools and provided with specific information before their utilization.  2016 eid: 2-s2.0-84982824306
9. **Home-based outpatient telepsychiatry to improve adherence with treatment appointments: A pilot study**
Objective: This study examined whether patients who had been nonadherent with outpatient appointments and who were randomly assigned to receive treatment through a telepsychiatry intervention (home-based video teleconferencing) would show improvement in adherence to appointments, compared with a treatment-As-usual group. Methods: Participants (N=22) were randomly assigned to home-based video teleconferencing or to outpatient treatment as usual during a six-month study. The primary outcome measure was improvement in visit adherence, which was analyzed using a two-sample t test. Results: Percentage improvement in visit adherence did not differ significantly between the telepsychiatry and treatmentas- usual groups (14%, compared with 15%). A greater number of participants in the telepsychiatry group reported less subjective difficulty in keeping appointments. Conclusions: A small number of participants, short study **period**, selection bias, and the Hawthorne effect may have limited measured impact in this study. The findings implied that visit nonadherence among frequently nonadherent individuals is largely unrelated to inconvenience. eid: 2-s2.0-85021819602
10. **Design and development of a stepped-care behavioral intervention to support parents of young children newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes**
One of the most common chronic conditions of childhood, the prevalence of type 1 diabetes (T1D) in young children is increasing. Early childhood development complicates optimal T1D management and glycemic outcomes. Parents are at risk for elevated psychological distress, especially immediately following diagnosis. Few empirically **support**ed interventions are available** to sup**port parents and promote optimal T1D management during this vulnerable **period**. This paper reports on the development and study design of First STEPS: Study of Type 1 in Early childhood and Pa**renting** Support. The aim of this trial is to **evalu**ate the efficacy of a stepped care behavioral intervention for parents of young children over the first year following a new T1D diagnosis. The stepped care design provides participants with up to three intensity levels, or steps, of clinical behavioral i**nterven**tion support based on need, compared to usual care. Intervention steps include peer parent coaching, telephone-b**ased be**havioral support, personalized psychological assessment and recommendations, and intensive assessment of T1D glycemic management with recommendations. Primary outcomes include children's glycemic control and parents' psychosocial functioning. Secondary outcomes include children's behavioral and psychosocial functioning. Exploratory analyses w**ill e**valuate demographic, disease-specific, and psychosocial factors related to progression in and response to each step of the intervention.  2017 Elsevier Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-85027531152
11. **Effectiveness of an online CBT-i intervention and a face-to-face treatment for shift work sleep disorder: A comparison of sleep diary data**
In western societies, about one in six employees works in shifts. Shiftwork is associated with a number of poor somatic and psychological health outcomes, especially sleep issues. Higher rates of absenteeism and accidents in the workplace are possible consequences. Still, prevention programs and treatment options that are specifically tailored to shift-workers needs are rare. We devised a 4-week online cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) intervention (n = 21) and compared sleep outcomes to a face-to-face outpatient treatment for shift-workers (n = 12) using a sleep diary and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). In the online sample, measures also included the World Health Organization wellbeing questionnaire (WHO-5) and the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). In the outpatient sample, the Beck **Depress**ion Inventory (BDI-II), the Montgomerysb**erg Dep**ression Rating Scale (MADRS), and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) were administered. Results showed significant improvements in sleep efficiency by 7.2% in the online sample and 7.7% in the outpatient sample. However, no significant difference was found in the rate of improvement in sleep efficiency across four weeks of treatment between the samples. In the online sample, the wellbeing (WHO-5) and insomnia symptoms (ISI) scores were significantly improved following the CBT-I intervention (p < 0.004 and p < 0.002 respectively). In the outpatient sample, symp**toms of** depression (BDI-II and MADRS scores) and insomnia symptoms (PSQI scores) improved significantly following the CBT-I intervention. In summary, CBT-I significantly improved sleep efficiency in both the online and outpatient samples, in addition to wellbeing, symptoms of in**somnia,** and depression. The findings of this study demonstrate online CBT-I as a feasible approach for treating insomnia in shift-workers. Future randomized controlled trials are needed.  2019 by the authors.

12. **Self-management intervention for head and neck cancer couples: Results of a randomized pilot trial**
Background: Patients with head and neck cancer (HNC) experience significant physical and psychological morbidity during radiotherapy (RT) that contributes to treatment interruptions and a poor quality of life. Although spouses/partners can help by encouraging patient self-management (eg, self-care) during RT, they often experience high psychological distress rates, lack basic health care knowledge and skills, and report increased marital conflict regarding patient self-management. The current pilot study examined the feasibility and acceptability of a 6-session telephone-based intervention called Spouses coping with the Head And neck Radiation Experience (SHARE), which teaches self-management, communication, and coping skills to patients with HNC and their spouses. The treatment effects of SHARE compared with usual medical care (UMC) in controlling patient physical symptoms and improving patient/spouse psychological and marital functioning also were examined. Methods: Thirty patients who **initi**ated RT and their spouses (60 participants; 40% of whom were racial/ethnic minorities) were randomized to SHARE or UMC, and preintervention and postintervention assessments were completed. Results: Solid recruitment (70%) and low attrition rates (7%) demonstrated feasibility. Strong program **evalu**ations and homework completion rates (72%) **support**ed acceptability. Significant treatment effects (medium in magnitude) were observed for SHARE compared with UMC with regard to HNC-specific physical symptom burden (Cohens d, -0.89) and symptom interference (Cohens d, -0.86). Medium to large effects favoring SHARE also were found for patient and spouse **depress**ive symptoms (Cohens d, -0.84) and cancer-specific distress (Cohens d, -1.05). Conclusions: The findings of the current st**udy sup**port the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of SHARE. They also suggest that programs that empower HNC couples with the necessary skills to coordinate care and manage the challenges of RT together hold great promise for controlling a patients physical symptoms and improving the psychological functioning of both partners.  2018 American Cancer Society eid: 2-s2.0-85058017264

14. **A pilot program in rural telepsychiatry for deaf and hard of hearing populations**
Background Access to mental health care in deaf communities is limited by cultural considerations, availability of translators, and technological considerations. Telepsychiatry can mitigate the deaf community's lack of access to care by allowing for deaf individuals in remote communities access to care with facilities that cater to their needs. Methods Community Behavioral Health, Arundel Lodge, and Gallaudet University worked in conjunction to test three hypotheses: Telepsychiatry will be as effective as traditional face-to-face psychotherapy with deaf adults who have chronic mental illness.Patients living in remote locations will report an improvement in accessibility to **mental health servic**es.Patients who receive telepsychiatry will report a comparable level of **satisfact**ion of services to those receiving traditional services. The patient sample consisted of 24 participants, 13 women, 11 men. Telepsychiatry sessions were scheduled based on each patient's individual treatment plan against a control group who saw their providers face to face. Results The telepsychiatry and in-person groups were slightly different at baseline. Analysis of the data revealed no significant difference in coping abilities and psychiatric symptoms between those receiving face-to-face psychotherapy and those receiving telepsychiatry. Interpretation The quality and outcome of care was equal to in-person for the telepsychiatry in deaf patients. Since telepsychiatry does not compromise the quality of care, it is a good means of reaching out to members of the deaf community that cannot readily access mental health resources that meet their needs.  2016 The Authors.

The efficacy of the treatment **was e**valuated using a semi-structured interview,self-report questionnaires, and daily self-monitoring diaries.Results. - The results demonstrate that overall, participants' conditions were improved following treat-ment and they no longer met the diagnostic criteria for GAD in the short-term. Participants' conditionsimproved clinically and statistically at each follow-up point, achieving a greater global level of functioningat post-test, as well as at 3-month and 12-month follow-up.Conclusion. - Clinical implications of this new treatment modality and directions for future research arediscussed.  2014 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS. eid: 2-s2.0-84921044648
16. **Success and failure in a Michigan telepsychiatry programme**
Telemedicine programmes are often complex undertakings that result in combinations of success and failure. Michigan State University and LifeWays received a grant for a four-phase telepsychiatry research project in 2000. We employed multiple data-collection techniques, including patient and provider surveys, in-depth interviews, observation, patient chart analyses, and organizational archival data analyses. Of the four phases in the project, two proved to be successful, one failed in its **initi**al goal but succeeded with a redefined goal, and one failed completely. Issues that affected success or failure included human resource conflicts, organizational structure, inter-organizational relationships and allocated resources. eid: 2-s2.0-0345238663
17. **Developing telepsychiatry services in kwazulu-Natal - an action research study**
Objective: In 2009, the Departments of Psychiatry and Telehealth of the University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN) **initi**ated a three year project to develop telepsychiatry services in KwaZulu-Natal. This paper describes the challenges and opportunities of this project. Method: This was a collaborative, in situ health service project and an action research framework was adopted. Over the three years, following a needs assessment and an e-health Readiness Assessment, two action research cycles were completed. Cycle 1: The preparation, implementation and **evalu**ation of educational material, technical requirements and clinical guidelines and clinical **support** materials. Cycle 2: Preparation **and e**valuation of educational and clinical outreach sessions. Results: Videoconference education sessions were beneficial to health staff without post-qualification psychiatry training. A flexible format for education improved knowledge outcomes. Clinical sessions are feasible, but require administration and techni**cal sup**port for facilitation. With facilitator training, 128Kbps is a suitable bandwidth for education but 384Kbps is preferred for clinical consultation. Conclusion: Telepsychiatry offers tremendous potential to facilitate the three strategies suggested by the World Psychiatric Association to address the treatment gap, save time and costs and improve access to the small pool of specialist psychiatrists in resource constrained environments. eid: 2-s2.0-84871026764
18. **Videoconferencing in a mental health service in The Netherlands: A randomized controlled trial on patient satisfaction and clinical outcomes for outpatients with severe mental illness**
Introduction: The goal of the study was to determinate if there was added value in the use of videoconferencing (VCF) in outpatient care for people with severe mental illness (SMI). Methods: A VCF-group was compared to a control group (care as usual) over a **period** of 18 months. Block randomization was used to assign patients to one of the two groups. The video communication was available to the patients on a 24/7 basis, so that emergency calls could also be made via VCF. The primary outcome was patient **satisfact**ion, other outcomes were: quality of life, loneliness, daily functioning (psychologically and socially), and the fulfilment of needs of care. Eventually, 93 patients signed their informed consent and participated. Results: For the primary outcome a statistically significant time by treatment interaction effect was found, where higher degree** of satis**faction was associated with the patients in the VCF-group. The secondary outcomes revealed no differences between the two groups. Despite the participants not using the VCF units extensively during the project, they were reasonably satisfied with VCF; on average, they rated the service with a 7.5 grade (on a scale from 110). Discussion: Although the study showed a positive result for **patient s**atisfaction, overall the VCF seemed to have limited impact. So VCF might not offer much added value to care as usual. However, statistical power in this study dropped somewhat due to dropout. Furthermore, VCF usage was lower than expected. Assuming that VCF will be most effective if it is actually used, it seems likely that the actual effect-size reached in this study has been significantly lower than the anticipated effect-size. Finally, this study shows that VCF is a tool that can be used in the care for people with severe mental illness.  2016,  The Author(s) 2016. eid: 2-s2.0-85020199870
19. **Usefulness of videoconferencing in psychiatric emergencies -- a qualitative study**
High quality health services for psychiatric emergencies are difficult to maintain 24h a day in sparsely populated areas, where the availability of specialists are limited. To overcome this challenge, the University Hospital of North Norway implemented an on-call system in psychiatric emergencies, by which psychiatrists are accessible 24/7 for telephone and videoconferencing consultations with patients and nurses at three regional psychiatric centers. The purpose of this study was to explore the usefulness of videoconferencing consultations in psychiatric emergencies. The on-call psychiatrists and nurses at the regional psychiatric centers who participated in at least one videoconferencing consultation were recruited for semi-structured interviews: 5 psychiatrists and 19 nurses for a total of 24 participants. The interviews were performed from July of 2012 to June of 2013. The interviews were transcribed and analyzed using a stepwise-deductive-inductive approach **support**ed by the HyperRESEARCH analysis software. After the introduction of the videoconferencing system, telephone consultations were still used for straightforward situations when further treatment or admission decisions were obvious. Videoconferencing consultations, during which patients were present, were useful for challenging situations when there was 1) uncertainty regarding the degree of illness or the level of treatment, 2) a need to clarify the severity of the patient condition, 3) a need to build an alliance with the patient, and 4) disagreement either between health personnel or between the patient and health personnel. Videoconferencing is useful for challenging and complex psychiatric emergencies and is a suitable tool for building high quality, decentralized psychiatric services.  2017, The Author(s). eid: 2-s2.0-85047478559
20. **An experimental comparison of telepsychiatry and conventional psychiatry for parolees**
Objective: Many offenders treated for psychiatric disorders while incarcerated are paroled to counties where psychiatric care is limited, leading some correctional departments to offer psychiatric treatment via videoconferencing ("telepsychiatry"). However, the effectiveness of telepsychiatry for offenders with psychiatric disorders has not been rigorously **evalu**ated. Methods: In this randomized field experiment, the authors compared the effectiveness of telepsychiatry and in-person psychiatric sessions (treatment as usual) among 71 parolees receiving outpatient psychiatric treatment over a six-month **period**. **Satisfact**ion with treatment, therapeutic alliance, medication adherence, and psychological functioning were measured. Follow-up data were collected from 60 of the 71 (85%) patients (N520, telepsychiatry; N540, control condition). Results: Findings revealed h**igh satis**faction with telepsychiatry overall and no significant group differences in medication adherence or psychological functioning. However, telepsychiatry patients reported lower levels of therapeutic alliance at follow-up. Conclusions: Telepsychiatry appeared to be an acceptable and effective approach for providing psychiatric care for this population. eid: 2-s2.0-84989933045
21. **Tailored online cognitive behavioural therapy with or without therapist support calls to target psychological distress in adults receiving haemodialysis: A feasibility randomised controlled trial**
Background Psychological distress is prevalent in haemodialysis (HD) patients yet access to psychotherapy remains limited. This study assessed the feasibility and acceptability of online cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) tailored for HD patients, with or without therapist **support**, for managing psychological distress. Methods This feasibility randomised controlled trial recruited patients from a UK HD centre. Following psychological distress screens, patients with mild-moderate psychological distress (Patient Health Questionnaire PHQ-9; score: 519 and/or Generalised Anxiety Disorder; GAD-7 score: 514) who met remaining inclusion criteria were approached for consent. Consenters were individually randomised (1:1) to online-CBT or online-CBT plus three therap**ist sup**port calls. Outcomes included recruitment, retention, and adherence rates. Exploratory change analyses were performed for: psychological distress, quality of life (QoL), illness perceptions, and costs. The statistician was blinded to allocation. Results 182 (44%) out of 410 patients approached completed psychological distress screens. 26% found screening unacceptable; a further 30% found it unfeasible. Psychological distress was detected in 101 (55%) patients, 60 of these met remaining inclusion criteria. The primary reason for ineligibility was poor computer literacy (N = 17, 53%). Twenty-five patients were randomised** to the** supported (N** = 18) **or unsupported arm (N = 7); 92% were retained at follow-up. No differences in psychological distress or cost-effectiveness were observed. No trial adverse events occurred. Conclusion Online CBT appears feasible but only for computer literate patients who identify with the label psychological distress. A def**initi**ve trial using the current methods for psychological distress screening and online care delivery is unfeasible.

22. **Feasibility of Group Cognitive-Behavioral Treatment of Insomnia Delivered by Clinical Video Telehealth**
Background: Clinical video telehealth provides a means for increasing access to psychotherapy. Insomnia is prevalent, is associated with a number of negative sequelae, and can be effectively managed with cognitive behavioral treatment of insomnia (CBT-I). Telehealth technologies can provide a means for increasing access to CBT-I. Materials and Methods: The Tele-Insomnia program is a Veterans Health Administration (VHA) **initi**ative in which CBT-I is delivered in a group format by telehealth. Veterans received six weekly sessions of group CBT-I, completing the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and daily sleep diaries throughout treatment. Paired-samples t-tests were used to examine differences in each measure from the first to the last session of treatment. Results: There were statistically and clinically significant improvements in the ISI and all sleep diary variables with the exception of total sleep time. Video quality was excellent, and there were few connectivity problems. Conclusions: Clinical video telehealth technology can be used to deliver group CBT-I in a manner that produces clinically significant improvement. This model is scalable and has been used to develop a national clinical telehealth program.  Copyright 2016, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2016. eid: 2-s2.0-85002882926

Creation of a comprehensive mental health telecommunications system to serve isolated persons in Georgia, resulting in a more equitable distribution of mental health resources, is the goal of the telepsychiatry program at the Medical College of Georgia. Although telepsychiatric consultation is not a new idea, the 'distribution' of telepsychiatry through additional integrated telecommunications channels such as the World Wide Web is a distinctive approach. This report describes the history of the development of the MCG Telepsychiatry Program. Through the use of a multichanneled telecommunications system, a more equitable distribution of mental health resources is underway in Georgia. eid: 2-s2.0-0033816892
24. **Implementation and Utilisation of Telepsychiatry in Ontario: A Population-Based Study**
Objective: **Rural** areas in Ontario have fewer psychiatrists, making access to specialist mental health care challenging. Our objective was to characterise psychiatrists delivering and patients receiving telepsychiatry in Ontario and to determine the number of patients who accessed a psychiatrist via telepsychiatry following discharge from psychiatric hospitalisation. Method: We conducted a serial panel study to **evalu**ate the characteristics of psychiatrists providing telepsychiatry from April 2007 to March 2013. In addition, we conducted a cross-sectional study for fiscal year 2012-2013 to examine telepsychiatry patient characteristics and create an in-need patient cohort of individuals with a recent psychiatric hospitalisation that assessed if they had follow-up with a psychiatrist in person or through telepsychiatry within 1 year of discharge. Results: In fiscal year 2012-2013, a total of 3801 people had 5635 telepsychiatry visits, and 7% (n = 138) of Ontario psychiatrists provided telepsychiatry. Of the 48,381 people identified as in need of psychiatric care, 60% saw a local psychiatrist, 39% saw no psychiatrist, and less than 1% saw a psychiatrist through telepsychiatry only or telepsychiatry in addition to local psychiatry within a year. Three northern regions had more than 50% of in-need patients fail to access psychiatry within 1 year. Conclusions: Currently, relatively few patients and psychiatrists use telepsychiatry. In addition, patients scarcely access telepsychiatry for posthospitalisation follow-up. This study, which serves as a preliminary baseline for telepsychiatry in Ontario, demonstrates that telepsychiatry has not evolved systematically to address need and highlights the importance of system-level planning when implementing telepsychiatry to optimise access to care.

Objective: The purpose of CanTeen's E-**Mental Health Servic**e for Young People Living With Cancer (YPLWC) is to meet the unique psychosocial needs of young people (12-24 years) in Australia impacted by cancer (either as a patient or family member of someone with cancer). Conclusions: This online platform will provide the primary site where all YPLWC can find information, connect with others going through a similar experience, express their feelings, utilise tools for **support** and access professional psychosoc**ial sup**port services that will meet their individual needs. The overall outcome of the service will be to ensure that the YPLWC visiting the site experience optimal psychological wellbeing. Ultimately, the service's value will be in improving the lives of young people who engage with it and the follow-on effect that this will have on their families and communities in the long-term.

26. **Satisfaction with long-distance motivational interviewing for problem drinking**
OBJECTIVES: To examine the relationship between participant preference and **satisfact**ion with live interactive video, telephone, or face-to-face motivational interviewing sessions with problem drinkers. METHODS: Participants complete**d a satis**faction questionnaire after each motivational interviewing counseling session utilizing an abbreviated Likert scale. The participants were asked what mode they would have preferred**, their s**atisfaction with their counselor**, and the**ir satisfaction with overall counseling. RESULTS: When asked to choose a long-distance mode of communication, televideo was preferred more than 2:1 over telephone. Also those with televideo experience were significantly more likely to choose televideo as a preferred long-distance mode of choice. CONCLUSIONS: Findings **support** the acceptability of 2 forms of long-distance communication, telephone and televideo, which might reasonably be studied in the future in **rural** areas (with some preference for televideo) to reduce heavy drinking and alcohol-related problems.  2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-33947185640
27. **Telepsychiatry appointments in a continuing care setting: Kept, cancelled and no-shows**
We reviewed the appointment data for a psychiatry service in California that provided consultations and also therapy through telepsychiatry. Over an 18-month **period**, there were 7523 telepsychiatry appointments and 115,148 conventional (face-to-face) appointments. A higher proportion of the telepsychiatry appointments was kept (92% telepsychiatry vs. 87% non-telepsychiatry). Also, telepsychiatry appointments were significantly less likely to be cancelled by patients (3.5% vs. 4.8%) and significantly less likely to be no-shows (4.2% vs. 7.8%). These findings were similar in three of the four counties where the service was delivered. However, one county was different, and further examination suggested that the morale of the staff and patients may have contributed to the unenthusiastic acceptance of telepsychiatry. We conclude that telepsychiatry can be used effectively in continuing care settings as well as in **evalu**ation settings, and that staff and patient morale are important factors in successful telepsychiatry. eid: 2-s2.0-70349696011
28. **Agreement on web-based diagnoses and severity of mental health problems in norwegian child and adolescent mental health services**
Objective: This study examined the agreement between diagnoses and severity ratings assigned by clinicians using a structured web-based interview within a child and adolescent mental health outpatient setting. Method: Information on 100 youths was obtained from multiple informants through a web-based Development and Well-Being Assessment (DAWBA). Based on this information, four experienced clinicians independently diagnosed (according to the International Classification of Diseases Revision 10) and rated the severity of mental health problems according to the Health of the Nation Outcome Scales for Children and Adolescents (HoNOSCA) and the Children's Global Assessment Scale (C-GAS). Results: Agreement for diagnosis was K=0.69-0.82. Intra-class correlation for single measures was 0.78 for HoNOSCA and 0.74 for C-GAS, and 0.93 and 0.92, respectively for average measures. Conclusions: Agreement was good to excellent for all diagnostic categories. Agreement for severity was moderate, but improved to substantial when the average of the ratings given by all clinicians was considered. Therefore, we conclude that experienced clinicians can assign reliable diagnoses and assess severity based on DAWBA data collected online.

29. **A telepsychiatry transition clinic: The first 12 months experience**
To improve the management of soldiers with combat-related mental health problems, an interdisciplinary telepsychiatry service was established between a clinic at the Fort Bragg army base and the Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Center in Salem. In the first 12 months of operation, 120 soldiers (105 males) were seen in a total of 394 telepsychiatry sessions. The time spent on telepsychiatry by the six VA psychiatrists increased from 13 hours in the first month to 41 hours in the twelfth month. The number of telepsychiatry sessions increased from nine in the first month to 56 in the twelfth month. The mean global assessment of function score (GAF) in the soldiers increased significantly (P<0.001) from 58.0 at intake to 62.3 at the last visit. Soldiers received VA telepsychiatry on average 22 days after the **initi**al consultation with a primary care provider, a reduction of at least eight days compared to the previous delay. The majority of soldiers (89%) who were treated by VA psychiatrists enrolled in the VA within about six months of discharge. Similar VA-US Military collaborations may prove beneficial for other military bases that have returning combat soldiers. eid: 2-s2.0-80052157726
30. **Ethical and Clinical Challenges Delivering Group-based Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy to Adolescents and Young Adults with Cancer Using Videoconferencing Technology**
Objective: Adolescents and young adults with cancer have poorer psychological outcomes relative to both younger and older patients. Their distress often peaks at the completion of cancer treatment, as they return to their normal lives while hospital-based **support** is reduced. Telepsychology has the potential to reduce help-seeking barriers in this group; nevertheless, other challenges remain. This article discusses the Recapture Life randomised controlled trial, which involved online, videoconferencing-based delivery of group-based cognitive-behavioural therapy to adolescents and young adults aged 15-25 years in the first year post-treatment. Methods: A case series (n=11, 53% females, mean age=21.1 years) is presented to illustrate ethical and clinical considerations in delivering cognitive-behavioural therapy in the online environment. Results: Across the study trajectory, ethical/clinical issues were documented among between 3.0-14.3% of participants. Almost half of the incidents (45%) were identified through routine safeguards built into the intake protocol. Challenges described include: (a) managing mental health risks without face-to-face contact; (b) facilitating discussion about potentially distressing cancer-related experiences in a group setting; (c) responding appropriately to participants' health changes (e.g., cancer relapse) during the trial; and (d) the need to be mindful of a range of 'survivorship' experiences and outlooks. Conclusions: We conclude by reflecting on the clinical 'trade-offs' that exist when the provision of therapy reliant on human interaction is transferred to an electronic realm. Despite the potential challenges, we argue that telepsychology is critical to broadening access to timely, evidence-based therapy among vulnerable groups, such as young people with cancer.  2015 The Australian Psychological Society. eid: 2-s2.0-84937551251
31. **Training the next generation of counseling psychologists in the practice of telepsychology**
Training programs that integrate the use of technology are needed to prepare students for the future of service delivery in psychology. Training opportunities in telepsychology can equip students to develop, implement, and **evalu**ate innovative modalities for mental health care. However, few options are available for trainees seeking to acquire these experiences, and while guidelines for service provision using technology are emerging, guidelines for and documented examples of training programs in telepsychology are virtually non-existent. The Telehealth Counseling Clinic, located at the Texas A&M Health Science Center, has developed a training model to prepare the next generation of psychologists to work with new technology to provide counseling services to low-income and uninsured individuals living in designated Mental Health Professional Shortage Areas in **rural** Texas. Training competencies necessary to serve this population through telepsychology are discussed and prelimin**ary e**valuation data of the training program are presented.  2015 Taylor & Francis. eid: 2-s2.0-84956732110
32. **Evaluation of a rural telepsychiatry service**
Objective: To **evalu**ate a telepsychiatry clinical service to Wagga Wagga in **rural** New South Wales, comprising a face-to-face interview with a psychiatrist followed by a telepsychiatry interview with a Sydney-based psychiatrist. Methods: Thirty-one patients were referred to a specialist mood disorder clinic i**n a r**ural setting for consultation and assessment. A retrospect**ive e**valuation was made to determine the acceptance of the teleconferenced psychiatry and face-to-face psychiatry, as well as the overall patient response. Results: Twenty participants comple**ted a**ll evaluation components. Their results indicated a **satisfact**ion level of 95% with the consultation process as a whole, with 80% happy to use telepsychiatry again and 60% preferring telepsychiatry over travelling to a larger centre for face-to-face consultation. The face-to-face component **was satis**factory for 85% of patients while the telepsychiatry compon**ent was s**atisfactory for 72%. Conclusions: Although face-to-face psychiatry was preferred by this sample, the telepsychiatry component was highly rated and preferred over travel to larger centres for face-to-face consultation, by resid**ents **of rural and remote locations. Certain issues are of more concern in telepsychiatry than face-to-face psychiatry, including confidentiality, rapport, explanation and education. eid: 2-s2.0-4744354629
33. **The Delivery of a Tele-Psychology Service to Shetland**
This paper describes preliminary findings of a pilot project designed to **evalu**ate a teleconferencing clinical psychology service between Aberdeen and Shetland. Over a 12-month **period**, 10 clients were assessed face-to-face in Shetland, then attended an average of 12 therapy sessions each via a teleconferencing link with a clinical psychologist based in Aberdeen. The majority of clients reported that they were satisfied with the tele-therapy, and some expressed a preference for this mode of communication because they felt it reduced confrontational aspects of contact and increased their perception of control. One client was not able to continue after two **initi**al sessions due his discomfort at discussing his difficulties 'in Cyberspace'. The clinical psychologist was satisfied with using teleconferencing as a mode of providing treatment, and felt that therapeutic rapport was not compromised by the technology. A number of recommendations are made for consideration by those planning to deliver telepsychology services in future. Copyright  2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. eid: 2-s2.0-0004531530
34. **Signal delay effects on rapport in telepsychiatry**
Video-mediated communication research has shown that telecommunication signal delay can cause difficulty in interpersonal coordination of conversation. Studies of rapport suggest that interpersonal coordination is an important aspect of rapport. This study investigated the effect of signal delay on the level of rapport in quasi-psychotherapy sessions (stress **evalu**ation). Video conference counseling sessions were conducted with three levels of signal delay, zero, 300 ms, and 1,000 ms. These were compared to face-to-face counseling sessions. Three male counselors conducted the sessions. Forty-eight client participants, primarily male and female college students, were enrolled in the str**ess e**valuations. The level of client perceived rapport was measured using a self-report instrument administered following the session. The results did not provide evidence for an effect on rapport from delay when considering males and females together. However, males and females were found to respond differently regarding rapport. While no significant differences in rapport were found for males, females scored lower for rapport in the face-to-face condition than in the zero delay and the 300 ms delay condition. These differences may be attributed to the medium rather than to signal delay. Females may have felt more comfortable with unfamiliar male counselors in the video conferences because of the isolation provided, an effect that may have therapeutic application. eid: 2-s2.0-0034002612
35. **Pilot Assessment and Survey of Syrian Refugees' Psychological Stress and Openness to Referral for Telepsychiatry (PASSPORT Study)**
Background: Given the scarcity of mental health resources available for refugees in areas of conflict, it is imperative to investigate interventions that would be accepted by the refugees. Materials and Methods: In this study we surveyed 354 Syrian refugees using the HADStress screening tool and asked about their openness to referral to psychiatry and telepsychiatry. Results: Of the surveyed sample, 41.8% had scores on HADStress that correlate to posttraumatic stress disorder. However, only 34% of the whole sample reported a perceived need to see a psychiatrist, and of those only 45% were open to telepsychiatry. Conclusions: Women, those who were bilingual, and those with positive HADStress status were less likely to accept telepsychiatry; however, this finding did not reach statistical significance. This study reports a partial acceptance of Syrian refugees for telepsychiatric services despite the high prevalence of psychological stress.

37. **Attitudes Toward Psychological Telehealth: Current and Future Clinical Psychologists' Opinions of Internet-Based Interventions**
Objectives: The current study explored differences in acceptance of telehealth interventions amongst currently licensed and future clinicians with a focus on web camera-based intervention. The influence of theoretical orientation was also assessed. Method: An online survey assessed 717 participants comprising 409 licensed psychologists (40.8% female, mean age = 56.57, standard deviation [SD] = 11.01) and 308 doctoral-level students (78.9% female, mean age = 27.66, SD = 5.9) across domains of endorsement and rejection. Results: Binary logistic regression indicated no significant difference between currently licensed and future psychologists in their endorsement of telehealth modalities. Cognitive-behavioral, cognitive, behavioral, and systems psychologists were significantly more accepting of telehealth interventions than were dynamic/analytic or existential therapists. Conclusions: Increasing exposure to telehealth through education as well as continued research on efficacy for specific diagnoses may help psychologists to more effectively determine whether telehealth is the "best fit" for both clinician and client.  2012 Wiley **Period**icals, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-84870919311

India, with its huge population and limited mental health resources, must find alternative ways of delivering its mental healthcare services. Telepsychiatry seems to be a promising option even with no regulatory authority in place or specific laws in India that deal with telemedicine practice, there has been a mushrooming of telemedicine services in India. Healthy cooperation between government organizations such as the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) and institutions in the non-government and private sectors is another key feature in India. The experience of the Schizophrenia Research Foundation (SCARF), at Chennai, in South India, in running and establishing a telepsychiatry network is presented in this article. We identified the following tasks as essential to ensure an efficient intervention using telemedicine: identifying a suitable technology, a suitable location, and a local collaborator; providing training and creating awareness; establishing peripheral telepsychiatry centers and ensuring case documentation; and accountability.

Many studies have shown the feasibility of psychiatric consultation in telehealth, and some have addressed the effectiveness of telepsychotherapy. However, outcome studies on telepsychiatry essentially amount to a few case studies, none of which have used an empirically validated psychosocial treatment to treat a specific mental disorder. This article presents the preliminary results of an outcome study on the effectiveness of telepsychotherapy for panic disorder with agoraphobia. Participants received 12 sessions of cognitive-behavior therapy, which is an empirically validated treatment for panic disorder with agoraphobia. The treatment was delivered via videoconference by trained therapists according to a standardized treatment manual. The remote site was located at 130 km north of the local site and both were linked by six ISDN lines. Telepsychotherapy demonstrated statistically and clinically significant improvements on measures of target symptoms (frequency, of panic attacks, panic apprehension, severity of panic disorder, perceived self-efficacy) and measures of global functioning (trait anxiety, general improvement). Of interest was the fact that a very good therapeutic alliance was built after only the first telepsychotherapy session. Factors that may reduce the effectiveness of telepsychotherapy are discussed. eid: 2-s2.0-0034530048

42. **Feasibility of brief psychological distress screening by a community-based telephone helpline for cancer patients and carers**
Background: Up to one-third of people affected by cancer experience ongoing psychological distress and would benefit from screening followed by an appropriate level of psychological intervention. This rarely occurs in routine clinical practice due to barriers such as lack of time and experience. This study investigated the feasibility of community-based telephone helpline operators screening callers affected by cancer for their level of distress using a brief screening tool (Distress Thermometer), and triaging to the appropriate level of care using a tiered model.Methods: Consecutive cancer patients and carers who contacted the helpline from September-December 2006 (n = 341) were invited to participate. Routine screening and triage was conducted by helpline operators at this time. Additional socio-demographic and psychosocial adjustment data were collected by telephone interview by research staff following the **initi**al call.Results: The Distress Thermometer had good overall accuracy in detecting general psychosocial morbidity (Hospital Anxiety and **Depress**ion Scale cut-off score  15) for cancer patients (AUC = 0.73) and carers (AUC = 0.70). We found 73% of participants met the Distress Thermometer cut-off for distress caseness according to the Hospital Anxiety **and Dep**ression Scale (a score  4), and optimal sensitivity (83%, 77%) and specificity (51%, 48%) were obtained with cut-offs of  4 and  6 in the patient and carer groups respectively. Distress was significantly associated with the Hospital Anxi**ety and** Depression Scale scores (total, as well as **anxiety** and depression subscales) and level of care in cancer patients, as well as with the Hospi**tal Anx**iety and Depression Scale anxiety subscale for carers. There was a trend for more highly distressed callers to be triaged to more intensive care, with patients with distress scores  4 more likely to receive extended or specialist care.Conclusions: Our data suggest that it was feasible for community-based cancer helpline operators to screen callers for distress using a brief screening tool, the Distress Thermometer, and to triage callers to an appropriate level of care using a tiered model. The Distress Thermometer is a rapid and non-invasive alternative to longer psychometric instruments, and may provide part of the solution in ensuring distressed patients and carers affected by cancer are identified and **support**ed appropriately.  2010 Hawkes et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd. eid: 2-s2.0-77349102059

Local and county jails rarely offer telepsychiatry services to their inmates. We have established a telepsychiatry pilot project between the Kansas University Medical Center and the Lyon County Jail in Emporia, Kansas. A total of 264 telepsychiatry consultations were conducted with jail inmates. Of these, 70 were **initi**al **evalu**ations and 194 were follow-up visits; only one inmate refused to be seen. Approximately one-third of all inmates were seen for psychiatric consultation within one week of their incarceration and 68% were seen within one month of incarceration. Among lessons learned during the first year of service were: the monthly demand for consultations was five times greater than projected; moderately to severely ill inmates with a broad range of psychiatric illness can be seen and treated effectively using videoconferencing; and the technology was accepted by the jail personnel and the inmates alike and integrated into the jail's routine in terms of the delivery of psychiatric care. eid: 2-s2.0-0002683929
44. **The Utility of Videoconferencing to Provide Innovative Delivery of Psychological Treatment for Rural Cancer Patients: Results of a Pilot Study**
The unmet psychological needs of **rural** cancer patients are numerous. Telepsychology is a novel and feasible option that may provide cost-savings and help overcome inequalities in access to specialists. This is the first known study of psychological treatment for people with cancer delivered entirely via videoconferencing. We hypothesized that a telepsychology service would impr**ove r**ural cancer patients' anxiety and **depress**ion levels and quality of life, and would be an acceptable, **satisfact**ory, and practical mode of service delivery. Twenty-five cancer patients attended an average of three sessions with a clinical psychologist providing brief cognitive-behavioral therapy. Questionnaires were completed at pre-, post-, and 1-month follow-up. Patients benefited in terms of anxiety (P = 0.01) and quality of life (P = 0.04). The service was both practical and acceptable. These preliminary positive results provide a firm basis to conduct a randomized controlled trial of face-to-face interaction vs. videoconferencing.  2006 U.S. Cancer Pain Relief Committee. eid: 2-s2.0-33750504036

A study was carried out to describe the patient population assessed by a telepsychiatry consultation-liaison service in **rural** South Australia, and to assess the referrers' and patients' **satisfact**ion rating with this service. The study was performed in two parts, with retrospective and prospective components. The author completed a semi-structured interview for each patient (n=75) with a Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) for the prospective group (n=32). A questionnaire was also sent to all referrers seeking an **evalu**ation of the usefulness of the telepsychiatry interview in terms of assessment and management recommendations and outcome. Patients from the prospective group were sent a questionnaire examining th**eir e**valuation of the usefulness of the interview in terms of assessment and management recommendations, and difficulties with the technology. The patient population was characterized by high rates of affective disorder and personality disorder, and high indices of developmental disturbance. Referrers reported high rates** of satis**faction with the service. Nursing staff rated the service more positively than general practitioners. The usefulness for assessment was rated more highly than for management. eid: 2-s2.0-0030632517
46. **Telemedicine--clinical applications in mental health.**
Video conferences and the Telepsychiatry applications allow for an alternative approach to service delivery in **rural** areas. They rely heavily on user **support** and access to a suitably wide network. The ISDN transmission medium is capable of excellent audio and visual quality, but the consequence of this high grade quality is higher transmission costs. Our experiences have so far been positive. No patient has refused to use the medium, nor has any patient walked out of an interview without returning. It is possible to assess patients with a wide range of psychiatric disorders from personality disorders through to frank and severe psychosis. It is hard to see how the system could be used for formal insight oriented dynamic psychotherapy, but there is no reason why it should not be used for review type case management assessments and consultations as discussed in this paper. The interviewing techniques used on Telemedicine require further **evalu**ation but are exciting and interesting, and can probably teach us a great deal about how we might improve our clinical interviewing style. The difficulties in providing equitable services extend beyond access to country centres. Low population densities and cultural diversity, typical for much of remote Australia, demands an alternative approach for effective service provision. While video conferences cannot solve the inequity in service delivery, they can work as a useful adjunct to current service delivery strategies. eid: 2-s2.0-0029339961
47. **Identification of the hikikomori syndrome of social withdrawal: Psychosocial features and treatment preferences in four countries**
Background: Hikikomori, a form of social withdrawal first reported in Japan, may exist globally but cross-national studies of cases of hikikomori are lacking. Aims: To identify individuals with hikikomori in multiple countries and describe features of the condition. Method: Participants were recruited from sites in India, Japan, Korea and the United States. Hikikomori was defined as a 6-month or longer **period** of spending almost all time at home and avoiding social situations and social relationships, associated with significant distress/impairment. Additional measures included the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Loneliness Scale, Lubben Social Network Scale (LSNS-6), Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) and modified Cornell Treatment Preferences Index. Results: A total of 36 participants with hikikomori were identified, with cases detected in all four countries. These individuals had high levels of loneliness (UCLA Loneliness Scale M = 55.4, SD = 10.5), limited social networks (LSNS-6 M = 9.7, SD = 5.5) and moderate functional impairment (SDS M = 16.5, SD = 7.9). Of them 28 (78%) desired treatment for their social withdrawal, with a significantly higher preference for psychotherapy over pharmacotherapy, in-person over telepsychiatry treatment and mental health specialists over primary care providers. Across countries, participants with hikikomori had similar generally treatment preferences and psychosocial features. Conclusion: Hikikomori exists cross-nationally and can be assessed with a standardized assessment tool. Individuals with hikikomori have substantial psychosocial impairment and disability, and some may desire treatment.  2014 The Author(s). eid: 2-s2.0-84921878511
48. **Which helper behaviors and intervention styles are related to better short-term outcomes in telephone crisis intervention? Results from a silent monitoring study of calls to the U.S. 1-800-SUICIDE network**
A total of 2,611 calls to 14 helplines were monitored to observe helper behaviors and caller characteristics and changes during the calls. The relationship between intervention characteristics and call outcomes are reported for 1,431 crisis calls. Empathy and respect, as well as factor-analytically derived scales of **support**ive approach and good contact and collaborative problem solving were significantly related to positive outcomes, but not active listening. We recommend recruitment of helpers with these characteristics, development of standardized training in those methods that are empirically shown to be effective, and the need for research relating short-term outcomes to long-term effects.  2007 The American Association of Suicidology. eid: 2-s2.0-34250882070
49. **Randomized clinical trial of telepsychiatry through videoconference versus face-to-face conventional psychiatric treatment**
Although telepsychiatry in the form of videoconferencing has been well received in terms of increasing access to care and user **satisfact**ion, few data on treatment outcomes and efficacy from telepsychiatry applications are available at the present time. This paper **evalu**ates the efficacy of telepsychiatry through videoconference in the treatment of mental disorders by comparing to face-to-face conventional (F2FC) treatment. We carried out a randomized clinical trial where 140 psychiatric outpatients were randomized to either F2FC treatment or videoconference telepsychiatry (VCTP) treatment. Patients were diagnosed according to International Classification of Diseases, 10th edition (ICD-10) criteria using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Treatment involves eight consultations lasting 30 minutes over the 24-week study **period**. Patients received pertinent psychotropic medication plus cognitive-behavioral therapy during sessions. The same psychiatrist diagnosed and treated all the patients that were recruited from the Community Mental Health Centre of San Sebastian de la Gomera, in the Canary Islands. Change in psychiatric test scores served as the primary efficacy criterion. Efficacy was determined by comparing baseline (visit 1) Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness (CGI-S) and -Improvement (CGI-I) scales as well as Global Indexes (GSI, PSDI, and PST) from SCL-90R with scores obtained at the end of the st**udy pe**riod (week 24). Response was defined as a CGI-I score of 1 or 2. Reliable Change Indexes were computed in SCL-90R Global Indexes scores. Of 140 patients randomized, 130 completed 24 weeks of treatment. Only 4 patients dropped out prematurely from the study in VCTP and 6 in F2FC. The study involves 534 teleconsultations, 522 F2FC consultations, and more than 500 hours of clinical practice. Significant improvements were found on the CGI and SCL-90-R Global Indexes scores of both treatment groups, showing clear clinical state improvement. No statistically significant differences were observed when the efficacy of VCTP treatment was compared to F2FC psychiatric treatment efficacy. This study demonstrated that telepsychiatry treatment through videoconference has equivalent efficacy to F2FC psychiatric treatment. Telepsychiatry showed to be an effective mean of delivering **mental health servic**es to psychiatric outpatients living in remote areas with limited resources.

50. **Telepsychiatry: 'Tele' yes, but what about the 'psychiatry'?**
To investigate what is lost or gained in a psychiatric **evalu**ation when it takes place via telepsychiatry we compared the inter-rater reliability between two psychiatrists interviewing 63 subjects in an observer/interviewer split configuration in telepsychiatry and same-room settings. The measures used were the BPRS and interviewer ratings from a semi-structured interview. Patients also rated their experience. There were some clear differences between the telepsychiatry and same-r**oom e**valuations. Despite these variations, diagnoses were as reliably made by telepsychiatry. Patient acceptance of telepsychiatry was high. eid: 2-s2.0-0030632516
51. **Feasibility, acceptability, and sustainability of telepsychiatry for children and adolescents**
Objective: This study examined the feasibility, acceptability, and sustainability of a telepsychiatry service for children and adolescents living in nonmetropolitan communities. Methods: Using high- bandwidth interactive video teleconferencing, psychiatrists at a children's hospital provided care to patients of primary care physicians at four nonmetropolitan sites. Review of one-year utilization provided feasibility data. Surveys of referring physicians examined acceptability of telepsychiatry. Reimbursement records provided sustainability data. Results: Overall, 387 sessions were provided to 172 youths (mean=2.25 sessions) whose clinical profiles were representative of national samples. Referring providers endorsed high **satisfact**ion with telepsychiatric care, although pediatricians were consistently more satisfied than family physicians. Sustainability of telepsychiatry is challenged by infrastructure costs and low reimbursement by public payers. Conclusions: Telepsychiatry is a feasible and acceptable approach to providing psychiatric services to youths in underserved communities. Sustainability will depend on developing financial alternatives to fee-for-service, especially if caseloads emphasize publicly funded programs. eid: 2-s2.0-36749038421
52. **Resisting and promoting new technologies in clinical practice: The case of telepsychiatry**
New telecommunications technologies promise to profoundly change the spatial and temporal relationship between health professional and patient. This paper reports results from an ethnographic study of the introduction of a videophone or telemedicine system intended to facilitate faster and more convenient referral of patients with anxiety and **depress**ion in primary care, to a community mental health team. We explore the reasons for contest over the telemedicine system in practice, contrasting professionals critique of the technology in play with a more fundamental problem: the extent to which the telecommunications system threatened deeply embedded professional constructs about the nature and practice of therapeutic relationships.

53. **Use of Tele-Mental Health in Conjunction With In-Person Care: A Qualitative Exploration of Implementation Models**
OBJECTIVE: Although use of tele-**mental health servic**es is growing, there is limited research on how tele-mental health is deployed. This project aimed to describe how health centers use tele-mental health in conjunction with in-person care. METHODS: The 2018 Substance Abuse **and Mental Health Se**rvices Administration Behavioral Health Treatment Services Locator database was used to identify community mental health centers and federally qualified health centers with telehealth capabilities. Maximum diversity sampling was applied to recruit health center leaders to participate in semistructured interviews. Inductive and deductive approaches were used to develop site summaries, and a matrix analysis was conducted to identify and refine themes. RESULTS: Twenty health centers in 14 states participated. All health centers used telepsychiatry for diagnostic assessment and medication prescribing, and 10 also offered therapy via telehealth. Some health centers used their own staff to provi**de tele-mental healt**h services, whereas others contracted with external providers. In most health centers, tele-mental health was used as an adjunct to in-person care. In choosing between tele-mental health and in-person care, health centers often considered patient preference, patient acuity, and insurance status or payer. Although most health centers planned to continue offering tele-mental health, participants noted drawbacks, including less patient engagement, challenges sharing information within the care team, and greater inefficiency. CONCLUSIONS: Tele-mental health is generally used as an adjunct to in-person care. The results of this study can inform policy makers and clinicians regarding the various delivery models that incorporate tele-mental health. eid: 2-s2.0-85084961417
54. **Ultra brief psychological interventions for covid-19 pandemic: Introduction of a locally-adapted brief intervention for mental health and psychosocial support service**
The ultra-brief psychological interventions (UBPI) was created in 2018 to empower healthcare providers with psychological skills that can be delivered within a short **period**. Techniques used within UBPI were adopted from a variety of well established psychotherapies and distilled into its core essentials. This enabled practitioners of UBPI to deliver specific psychological skills in the appropriate context to the client withi**n a pe**riod of 1520 min. UBPI was also manualised to standardised training of practitioners. During the novel coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, UBPI was modified to suit the unique psychological demands of the pandemic. This article presents how UBPI was adapted and used with healthcare providers dealing with COVID-19 and also with the public who required psychological first aid (PFA).

55. **The importance of external clinical facilitation for a perinatal and infant telemental health service**
Introduction: Clinical facilitation is an established strategy for introducing innovation into clinical practice. The Queensland Centre for Perinatal and Infant Mental Health has used clinical facilitation to establish a telehealth service to **support** perinatal and infant mental health in regional, **rural** and remote areas of the Australian state of Queensland. The aim of this study is to explore the role of clinical facilitation in implementing and sustaining the telehealth service. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 14 remote-site users of the telehealth service. Interviews were analysed using thematic analysis. Results: Two dominant themes emerged: unmet need and service visibility. The study confirms the usefulness of telehealth as a way to address unmet need for specialist **mental health servic**es in region**al, r**ural and remote areas. The study also provides evidence that a telehealth service with intermittent demand requires a consistent clinical facilitator, to keep the service visible to remote-site clinicians and maintain awareness of the service as a referral option. Conclusion: Previous research has identified the importance of clinical facilitation in **initi**al service implementation. This study demonstrates the necessity of clinical facilitation for ongoing service provision. Facilitation is likely to be more important where the telehealth service responds to intermittent or infrequent clinical need, compared with high-volume services where clinics are conducted routinely.

56. **Veterans prospective attitudes about mental health treatment using telehealth**
The current study examined Veterans attitudes about the potential use of telepsychiatry for mental health treatment in routine clinical settings. Data were collected from Veteran outpatients (N = 253) who completed a series of self-report screening measures as part of their **initi**al **evalu**ation at an outpatient clinic providing care to Veterans with deployment-related mental health problems. Using a de-identified data repository, symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), **depress**ion, anxiety, and stress, as well as attitudes and level of comfort with receiving treatment through telehealth were assessed. Overall interest in telepsychiatry was mixed, with 25.7% of patients being not at all comfortable and 13.4% being extremely comfortable using telepsychiatry from home. Approximately one third (32.8%) of participants indicated a clear preference for telepsychiatry compared to in-person mental health visits. There were no differences in telepsychiatry preferences by symptom severity, demographic variables, **rural** versus urban location, or endorsed barriers to care. Although telepsychiatry may be a viable means of increasing access, patient preference should be considered, as a substantial percentage of Veterans in this study preferred in-person visits.

57. **Telepsychiatry and patient-provider concordance**
Context: Telepsychiatry has become a common modality for the provision of psychiatric consultations to patients in **rural** regions. Aims: The aims of this study were to assess and compare patient and provider **satisfact**ion and perceptions of access to care with telepsychiatry. Methods: Telepsychiatric consultations were given by providers based on an urban tertiary academic health centre to patients located** in r**ural primary care clinics. Results: Patients (n = 110) and providers (n = 10) were both highly satisfied with telepsychiatry and both believed that telepsychiatry provided patients with better access to care. Paired patient and provider survey results demonstrated a high level of concordance between patients and provider responses. Conclusions: Concordance between patient and provi**der satis**faction may contribute to adherence and positive treatment outcomes. These results provide **support** for the use of telepsychiatry consultations to improve patient access to psychiatric **care **in rural regions.Contexte: La tlpsychiatrie est maintenant une modalit courante de prestation de services psychiatriques aux patients vivan**t en **rgions rurales.

59. **Challenges and perspectives in the private practice of psychiatry: The development of tele-psychiatry [Enjeux et perspectives de la psychiatrie librale: le dveloppement de la tl-psychiatrie]**
Fall 2018 a comprehensive legislation has been launched in France on the practice of telemedicine, hence tele-psychiatry, historically one of its oldest application. This paper resulted from a presentation that has been made at the French Medico-Psychological Society President's Day, and aims at pointing out certain regulatory, ethical, and practical challenges in the development of tele-psychiatry, in a truly progressive manner, given its importance to the accelerating processes of digitalisation within our societies. French users of telemedicine services are 4 % only, which has to be compared to 31 % of Saudis: usage has evolved since 2010, year in which the first telemedicine legislation has been implemented in France. In just a few years, mobile health (m-health) has become increasingly important, while the legislation, and the funding models, were unchanged. Psychiatrists practicing telemedicine may simply use video consultation, but those who wish to, can also digitalise their practice from case history to analysis and prescription, with dedicated assistance software. In any case, practising telemedicine requires the use of approved software, prior training, and professionalism. Key features of Good Video Consultation Practices are described therein, along with broad recommendations on practicing trans-border video consultation sessions.  2018 Elsevier Masson SAS eid: 2-s2.0-85059465160
60. **Suicide risk management during clinical telepractice**
The effective assessment and management of suicidal patients is an essential component of telehealth-based care. With this article, we describe how we have implemented procedures for the ongoing assessment and management of suicide risk in a clinical trial that compares in-office treatment to homebased treatment delivered via web-cam to U.S. military service members and veterans with **depress**ion. We describe our safety protocol and how it was adapted from current recommended best practices, published guidelines, and local requirements for managing patient safety during home-based telepractice. We conclude with discussion of other key safety issues associated with telepractice. The topics discussed are relevant to all mental health practitioners who are interested in clinical telepractice services.  2014, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-84928543508
