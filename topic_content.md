0. **Remote consultations in the era of COVID-19 pandemic: Preliminary experience in a regional Australian public acute mental health care setting**
In the wake of the recent pandemic of Corona Virus Disease **2019** (COVID-19), with confirmed cases having crossed 750,000, **health** systems across the **world** are getting overwhelmed; making it strenuous to maintain essential **health** services. Several changes were implemented in our acute **mental** **health** **care** service using a collaborative approach to maintain a balance between preventive measures to flatten the curve and to provide **care** to those who were in need. Mode of service delivery was changed predominantly to tele-medicine, amongst others. It was found to be a workable model, albeit further follow up will be required to better understand its viability and feasibility to withstand the COVID-19 cataclysm.  2020 EID: 2-s2.0-85083013026
1. **COVID-19 and mental health: A review of the existing literature**
The COVID-19 pandemic is a major **health** crisis affecting several nations, with over 720,000 cases and 33,000 confirmed deaths reported to date. Such widespread outbreaks are associated with adverse **mental** **health** consequences. Keeping this in mind, existing literature on the COVID-19 outbreak pertinent to **mental** **health** was retrieved via a literature search of the PubMed database. Published articles were classified according to their overall themes and summarized. Preliminary evidence suggests that symptoms of anxiety and depression (1628%) and self-reported stress (8%) are common psychological reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic, and may be associated with disturbed sleep. A number of individual and structural variables moderate this risk. In planning services for such populations, both the needs of the concerned people and the necessary preventive guidelines must be taken into account. The available literature has emerged from only a few of the affected countries, and may not reflect the experience of persons living in other parts of the world. In conclusion, subsyndromal **mental** **health** problems are a common response to the COVID-19 pandemic. There is a need for more representative research from other affected countries, particularly in vulnerable populations.  2020 Elsevier B.V. EID: 2-s2.0-85083048100
2. **Psychological interventions during COVID-19: Challenges for low and middle income countries**
At the start of 2020, the **2019** **coronavirus** **disease** (COVID-19), originating from China has spread to the world. There have been increasing numbers of confirmed cases and deaths around the globe. The COVID-19 pandemic has paved the way for considerable psychological and **psychosocial** morbidity among the general public and **health** **care** providers. An array of guidelines has been put forward by multiple agencies for combating **mental** **health** challenges. This paper addresses some of the **mental** **health** challenges faced by low and middle income countries (LMIC). It is worthwhile to note that these are challenges at the current stage of the pandemic and may change with the course of the pandemic itself.  2020 Elsevier B.V. EID: 2-s2.0-85084129392
3. **Ultra brief psychological interventions for covid-19 pandemic: Introduction of a locally-adapted brief intervention for mental health and psychosocial support service**
The ultra-brief psychological interventions (UBPI) was created in 2018 to empower healthcare providers with psychological skills that can be delivered within a short period. Techniques used within UBPI were adopted from a variety of well established psychotherapies and distilled into its core essentials. This enabled practitioners of UBPI to deliver specific psychological skills in the appropriate context to the client within a period of 1520 min. UBPI was also manualised to standardised training of practitioners. During the novel **coronavirus** **disease** of **2019** (COVID-19) pandemic, UBPI was modified to suit the unique psychological demands of the pandemic. This article presents how UBPI was adapted and used with healthcare providers dealing with COVID-19 and also with the public who required psychological first aid (PFA).

0. **Emergency Department Telepsychiatry Service Model for a Rural Regional Health System: The First Steps**
Background: Emergency departments (EDs) have recognized an increasing number of patients presenting with **mental** **health** (MH) concerns. This trend imposes greater demands upon EDs already operating at capacity. Many ED providers do not feel they are optimally prepared to provide the necessary MH care. One consideration in response to this dilemma is to use advanced telemedicine technology for psychiatric consultation. Introduction: We examined a rural-and community-based **health** system operating 21 EDs, none of which has direct access to psychiatric consultation. Dedicated beds to MH range from zero (in EDs with only 3 beds) to 6 (in an ED with 38 beds). Materials and Methods: We conducted a needs assessment of this **health** system. This included a survey of emergency room providers with a 67% response rate and site visits to directly observe patient flow and communication with ED staff. A visioning workshop provided input from ED staff. Data were also obtained, which reflected ED admissions for the year 2015. Results: The data provide a summary of provider concerns, a summary of MH presentations and diagnosis, and age groupings. The data also provide a time when most MH concerns present to the ED. Discussion: Based upon these results, a proposed model for delivering comprehensive regional emergency telepsychiatry and behavioral **health** services is proposed. Conclusions: Emergency telepsychiatry services may be a tenable solution for addressing the shortage of psychiatric consultation to EDs in light of increasing demand for MH treatment in the ED.  2019, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

1. **Evaluation and Implementation of a Telepsychiatry Trial in the Emergency Department of a Metropolitan Public Hospital**
Telepsychiatry via video conferencing is not new to **mental** **health** but has been expanding at a rapid rate over recent years. Initially it was introduced for treatment in remote and **rural** communities, but it is now being utilized in larger **health** settings due to increasing patient demand and cost-effectiveness. Emergency departments are becoming increasingly burdened, as the workforce cannot keep pace with the rising demand of patient **mental** **health** needs. While telepsychiatry has been shown to have treatment efficacy, research is still relatively new, especially within the emergency department context.  2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

2. **The symbolic affordances of a video-mediated gaze in emergency psychiatry**
While **mental** illness is a significant **health** challenge worldwide, the availability of specialists is limited, especially in **rural** areas and for psychiatric emergencies. Although tele-psychiatry, via real-time videoconferencing (VC), is used to provide consultative services in areas that lack psychiatrists, there are a paucity of studies on the use of VC for psychiatric emergencies. We examine how VC matters for patient involvement and professional practice in the first Norwegian emergency tele-psychiatric service. Through a decentralised on-call system, psychiatrists are accessible 24/7 by telephone and VC for patients and nurses in regional psychiatry centres. Based on 29 interviews with patients, psychiatrists and nurses, this article addresses how participation is fostered by VC, and how it may change the social dynamics of therapeutic emergency encounters. We identified four contributions of the video-mediated gaze in the therapeutic encounter including those of the: (1) immediacy of assessment, (2) increased transparency, (3) sense of access to the real expert, and (4) fostering of the patient's voice in therapeutic decisions. These VC inflections of the therapeutic encounter are a mix of the pragmatic (1 and 2) and the symbolic (3 and 4), assembling in these contexts to foster patient-centeredness. With a sociological approach to video-conferenced emergency psychiatry, the identification of symbolic affordances adds necessary nuances to the application of new technologies into fragile therapeutic communication.  2017 Elsevier Ltd EID: 2-s2.0-85037345227
3. **Use of Telepsychiatry in Pediatric Emergency Room to Decrease Length of Stay for Psychiatric Patients, Improve Resident On-Call Burden, and Reduce Factors Related to Physician Burnout**
Background: Our study aims to demonstrate through implementation of telepsychiatry for child psychiatry patients evaluated in the pediatric emergency room (PedsER); we can reduce length of stay (LOS) and reduce factors contributing to physician burnout through reduction of on-call travel burden. Introduction: Telepsychiatry has increased access to **health** care using real-time interactive videoconferencing, allowing clinicians and patients in separate locations to have a meaningful clinical encounter. Use has increased over the past several years given cost reduction and need for psychiatric specialty services in under-resourced systems. Materials and Methods: We evaluated data regarding child psychiatry fellow use of telepsychiatry through a prospective real-time questionnaire filled out by the on-call clinician from July 1, 2017 to December 23, 2017 (study period). LOS was measured from the patient's registration time through time of discharge. Results: Telepsychiatry significantly reduced the total monthly LOS for nonhospitalized patients in the PedsER during the study period compared to all prior months (285-193 h; p = 0.032) and compared to a similar prior seasonal time frame (329-193 h; p = 0.017). Telepsychiatry use reduced travel for face-to-face evaluations by 75% and saved 2.22 h per call day. Discussion: Unique in this study is enhancing on-site psychiatric consultation in the emergency room, rather than solving a systems issue of referring out for psychiatric consultation. Moreover, this study uniquely demonstrated a noted improvement in on-call physician travel burden by reducing travel time with telepsychiatry. Physician burnout is notably high during residency training. Factors such as telepsychiatry can improve work efficiency and lend time to activities outside of work, mitigating the onset of this challenging issue. Conclusions: Telepsychiatry was shown to be effective in reducing dwell time and improving on-call burden. This study also showed promise in our system for improving access to other forms of specialized care consultation in PedsER settings.  Copyright 2019, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2019.

4. **Telephone-based low intensity therapy after crisis presentations to the emergency department is associated with improved outcomes**
Introduction In Australia there is an overwhelming need to provide effective treatment to patients presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) in **mental** **health** crisis. We adapted Improving Access to Psychological Therapies service model (IAPT) from the National Health Service (NHS) method for the large scale delivery of psychological therapies throughout the United Kingdom to an Australian ED setting. This telephone-based low intensity therapy was provided to people presenting in crisis to the EDs with combinations of anxiety, depression, substance use, and suicidal thinking. Methods This uncontrolled study utilised session-by-session, before-and-after measures of anxiety and depression via Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7). Results Of 347 eligible post-crisis ED referred patients, 291 (83.9%) engaged with the IAPT team. Most patients (65%) had attended the ED previously on an average of 3.9 (SD = 6.0) occasions. Two hundred and forty one patients received an average of 4.1 (SD = 2.3) contacts of low-intensity psychological therapies including 1.2 (SD = 1.7) community outreach visits between 20th Oct 2011 and 31st Dec 2012. Treated patients reported clinically significant improvements in anxiety, depression and suicidal ideation. Uncontrolled effect sizes were moderate for anxiety (0.6) and depression (0.6). Discussion The Australian ED IAPT program demonstrated that the UK IAPT program could be adapted for emergency **mental** **health** patients and be associated with similar clinical benefits as the original program. Funding The Flinders Medical Centre IAPT program received Emergency Department project funding from the Australian Commonwealth Government through the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) and the South Australian Government initiative, Every Patient Every Service (EPES).  2015,  The Author(s) 2015.

5. **Child and Adolescent Emergency and Urgent Mental Health Delivery Through Telepsychiatry: 12-Month Prospective Study**
Background: The significant gap between children and adolescents presenting for emergency **mental** healthcare and the shortage of child and adolescent psychiatrists constitutes a major barrier to timely access for psychiatric assessment for **rural** and remote areas. Unlike remote areas, urban emergency departments have in-house psychiatric consultation. Telepsychiatry may be a solution to ensure the same service for remote areas. However, there is a paucity of studies on the use of telepsychiatry for child and adolescent emergency consults. Thus, the aim of our study was to (1) assess patient satisfaction with telepsychiatry and (2) compare clinical characteristics and outcome of telepsychiatry with face-to-face emergency child and adolescent assessments. Methods: This is a prospective study of telepsychiatry emergency assessments of children and adolescents referred by emergency physicians. The comparison group was age- and gender-matched patients seen for face-to-face urgent assessments. Data were gathered on demographic and clinical variables. Telepsychiatry satisfaction was assessed using a questionnaire. Descriptive statistics and chi-square tests were used to assess group differences for each variable. Logistic regression was used to assess impact of the variables on outcome after the consult. A p value <0.05 was used to determine statistical significance. Results: Sixty (n = 60) assessments were conducted through telepsychiatry in 12 months. Among the telepsychiatry group, Aboriginal patients were over-represented (50% vs. 6.7%, p < 0.001), a higher proportion received a diagnosis of adjustment disorder (22% vs. 8.3%, p = 0.004) or no diagnosis (27% vs. 6.7%, p = 0.004) compared with controls. There was no statistically significant difference between groups on other clinical variables. Patients reported a high degree of satisfaction with telepsychiatry. Conclusions: Telepsychiatry is acceptable to patients and families for safe emergency assessment and follow-up, reducing unnecessary travel to urban centers. Longer time outcomes are needed to establish validity of telepsychiatry for emergency assessments.  Copyright 2017, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2017. EID: 2-s2.0-85031290037
6. **Reduced Unplanned Care and Disease Activity and Increased Quality of Life After Patient Enrollment in an Inflammatory Bowel Disease Medical Home**
Background & Aims: Specialty medical homes (SMHs) are a new **health** care model in which a multidisciplinary team and specialists manage patients with chronic diseases. As **part** of a large integrated payerprovider network, we formed an inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) SMH and investigated its effects on **health** care use, disease activity, and quality of life (QoL). Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of 322 patients (58% female; mean age, 34.6 y; 62% with Crohn's disease; 32% with prior IBD surgery) enrolled in an IBD SMH, in conjunction with the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Health Plan, from June 2015 through July 2016. Patients had at least 1 year of follow up. We evaluated changes in numbers of emergency department visits and hospitalizations from the year before vs after SMH enrollment. Secondary measures included IBD activity assessments and QoL. Results: Compared to the year before IBD SMH enrollment, patients had a 47.3% reduction in emergency department visits (P <.0001) and a 35.9% reduction in hospitalizations (P =.008). In the year following IBD SMH enrollment, patients had significant reductions in the median HarveyBradshaw Index score (reduced from 4 to 3.5; P =.002), and median ulcerative colitis activity index score (from 4 to 3; P =.0003), and increases in QoL (median short inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire score increased from 50 to 51.8; P <.0001). Patients in the most extreme (highest and lowest) quartiles had the most improvement when we compared scores at baseline vs after enrollment. Based on multivariable regression analysis, use of corticosteroids (odds ratio [OR], 2.72; 95% CI, 1.325.66; P =.007) or opioids (OR, 3.20; 95% CI, 1.327.78; P =.01), and low QoL (OR, 4.44; 95% CI, 1.0818.250; P =.04) at enrollment were significantly associated with persistent emergency department visits and hospitalizations. Conclusions: We found development of an IBD SMH to be feasible and significantly reduce unplanned care and disease activity and increase patient QoL 1 year after enrollment.  2018 AGA Institute EID: 2-s2.0-85050114456
7. **No longer 'flying blind': How access has changed emergency mental health care in rural and remote emergency departments, a qualitative study**
Background: Mental **health** presentations are considered to be a difficult aspect of emergency care. Although emergency department (ED) staff is qualified to provide emergency **mental** **health** care, for some, such presentations pose a challenge to their training, confidence, and time. Providing access to relevant and responsive specialist **mental** **health** care can influence care and management for these patients. The Mental Health Emergency Care-Rural Access Program (MHEC-RAP) is a telepsychiatry program that was established to improve access to specialist emergency **mental** **health** care across **rural** and remote western NSW, Australia. Method: This study uses interviews with ED providers to understand their experience of managing emergency **mental** **health** patients and their use of MHEC-RAP. The lens of access was applied to assess program impact and inform continuing program development. Results: With MHEC-RAP, these ED providers are no longer 'flying blind'. They are also more confident to manage and care for emergency **mental** **health** patients locally. For these providers, access to specialists who are able to conduct assessments and provide relevant and responsive advice for emergency **mental** **health** presentations was valued. Assessing the fit between the consumer and service as a requirement for the development, evaluation, and ongoing management of the service should result in decisions about design and delivery that achieve improved access to care and meet the needs of their consumers. The experience of these providers prior to MHEC-RAP is consistent with that reported in other **rural** and remote populations suggesting that MHEC-RAP could address limitations in access to specialist care and change the provision of emergency **mental** **health** care elsewhere. Conclusion: MHEC-RAP has not only provided access to specialist **mental** **health** care for local ED providers, but it has changed their practice and perspective. MHEC-RAP could be adapted for implementation elsewhere. Provider experience confirms that the program is accessible and offers insights to those considering how to establish an emergency telepyschiatry service in other settings.  2015 Saurman et al.; licensee BioMed Central.

8. **Assessing program efficiency: A time and motion study of the mental health emergency care - Rural access program in NSW Australia**
The Mental Health Emergency Care-Rural Access Program (MHEC-RAP) is a telehealth solution providing specialist emergency **mental** **health** care to **rural** and remote communities across western NSW, Australia. This is the first time and motion (T&M) study to examine program efficiency and capacity for a telepsychiatry program. Clinical services are an integral aspect of the program accounting for 6% of all activities and 50% of the time spent conducting program activities, but half of this time is spent completing clinical paperwork. This finding emphasizes the importance of these services to program efficiency and the need to address variability of service provision to impact capacity. Currently, there is no efficiency benchmark for emergency telepsychiatry programs. Findings suggest that MHEC-RAP could increase its activity without affecting program responsiveness. T&M studies not only determine activity and time expenditure, but have a wider application assessing program efficiency by understanding, defining, and calculating capacity. T&M studies can inform future program development of MHEC-RAP and similar telehealth programs, both in Australia and overseas.  2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

9. **Telemental health evaluations enhance access and efficiency in a critical access hospital emergency department**
Introduction: Mentally ill patients in crisis presenting to critical access hospital emergency rooms often face exorbitant wait times to be evaluated by a trained **mental** **health** provider. Patients may be discharged from the hospital before receiving an evaluation or boarded in a hospital bed for observation, reducing quality and increasing costs. This study examined the effectiveness of an emergency telemental **health** evaluation service implemented in a **rural** hospital emergency room. Materials and Methods: Retrospective data collection was implemented to consider patients presenting to the emergency room for 212 days prior to telemedicine interventions and for 184 days after. The study compared measures of time to treatment, length of stay (regardless of inpatient or outpatient status), and door-to-consult time. Results: There were 24 patients seen before telemedicine was implemented and 38 seen using telemedicine. All patients had a **mental** **health** evaluation ordered by a physician and completed by a **mental** **health** specialist. Significant reductions in all three time measures were observed. Mean and median times to consult were reduced from 16.2 h (standard deviation=13.2 h) and 14.2 h, respectively, to 5.4 h (standard deviation=6.4 h) and 2.6 h. Similar reductions in length of stay and door-to-consult times were observed. By t tests, use of telemedicine was associated with a statistically significant reduction in all three outcome measures. Conclusions: Telemedicine appears to be an effective intervention for mentally ill patients by providing more timely access to **mental** **health** evaluations in **rural** hospital emergency departments.  2014 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

10. **Emergency management guidelines for telepsychiatry**
Objective: Telepsychiatry, in the form of live interactive videoconferencing, is an emerging application for emergency psychiatric assessment and treatment and can improve the quality and quantity of **mental** **health** services, particularly for rural, remote and isolated populations. Despite the potential of emergency telepsychiatry, the literature has been fairly limited in this area. Method: Drawing on the combined clinical and administrative experiences of its authors, this article reviews the common administrative, legal/ethical and clinical issues that arise in emergency telepsychiatry. Results: An initial set of guidelines for emergency telepsychiatry is presented to generate further discussion to assist those who are considering establishing general telepsychiatry and/or emergency telepsychiatry services. Conclusion: The practices and techniques of emergency telepsychiatry are relatively new and require further examination, modification and refinement so that they may be fully utilized within comprehensive **mental** **health** service systems.  2007 Elsevier Inc.

0. **A comparison of on-site and telepsychiatry supervision**
Telemedicine has been used in **rural** settings for more than 25 years to provide services for patients and educational opportunities for practitioners. There is little documentation in the literature about using telepsychiatry for supervising psychiatric nurse practitioners. This article discusses the supervision experiences of two groups of psychiatric nurse practitioners. One group of four nurses met weekly with a psychiatrist on-site. The other group of four nurses, working in three different clinical locations in Maine, met via a two-way interactive television connection with a psychiatrist based in Boston, Massachusetts.

1. **Psychotherapy supervision conducted via videoconferencing: A qualitative study of users' experiences**
The 70 h of mandatory psychotherapy supervision for psychiatry residents in Norway is designed to develop insight into the therapeutic relationship. Essential in fulfilling the intentions of psychotherapy supervision is, for example, the ability to openly express and utilize personal experiences, emotions, and reactions. Six supervision pairs - six candidates and two supervisors - participated in a study to evaluate the quality of the psychotherapy supervision process when supervisors and candidates communicate by means of interactive audiovisual videoconferencing (VC). Each candidate and their respective supervisors participated in 10 supervised sessions, with 5 VC-based and 5 face-to-face sessions alternating every other session weekly. The part of the study reported in this article is based on qualitative interviews conducted at the conclusion of the 60 sessions. The article concludes that the quality of psychotherapy supervision can be satisfactorily maintained by using VC (384 kbit/sec) for up to 50% of the 70 h of required psychotherapy supervision. The prerequisite for this estimate is that the pair in question has met face-to-face and established a **relationship** characterized by mutual trust and respect. The study further indicates that the limitations imposed by VC may, paradoxically enough, stimulate the development of insights and communication abilities that contribute positively to the quality of psychotherapy supervision, also in a face-to-face setting. The most obvious implications of the study are the potentials provided by new technology for implementing decentralized models for recruiting and educating psychiatrists. EID: 2-s2.0-0031751739
2. **Psychotherapy supervision face-to-face and by videoconferencing: A comparative study**
A Shortage in qualified psychotherapy supervisors in **rural** Norway motivated a study evaluating the quality of the supervision process when supervisors and trainees communicated by interactive audiovisual videoconferencing (VC). Six trainee and supervisor pairs participated in five alternating VC based and face-to-face sessions. The pairs had previously established a good face-to-face relationship. Self-report data of the quality of communication, the alliance and disturbing elements in the supervision sessions were collected from specially designed questionnaires completed after each session. Independent ratings of the videotaped sessions and qualitative interviews conducted at the end of the study were also conducted. The only significant difference between the two conditions was that trainees scored higher on disturbing factors under VC conditions. Recommendations for use of VC are provided in light of the findings. EID: 2-s2.0-0032776019

0. **Use of Reimbursed Psychology Videoconference Services in Australia After Their Introduction: An Investigation Using Administrative Data**
Background: In November 2017, the Australian government approved reimbursement for psychology consultations conducted by videoconference under the Better Access initiative to address inequitable access of mental health services across regions in Australia. Objective: This project uses publically available activity data from the Medicare Benefits Scheme to quantify the uptake of videoconference for psychology resulting from the initiative change. Methods: Data were extracted from the Medicare Benefits Schedule item reports using the item codes for standard consultations and the new item codes for videoconference consultations. Activity data from 2 years before and the **first** year of the change to the Better Access initiative were compared to examine the uptake of videoconference for psychology. Data were stratified by allied health profession, sex, age and state jurisdiction. Results: In the 1-year period after the introduction of reimbursed videoconference consultations, approximately 5.7 million in-person consultations and 4141 videoconference consultations were funded by Medicare in Australia. Videoconference consultations comprised 0.07% of the total consultations performed in that 1-year period and showed an increased trajectory. The results can guide future research into evaluating the clinical outcomes of patients via both in-person and videoconference delivery modes. Conclusions: Videoconference mental health services were used in the **first** year that they were available, although they only accounted for a small percentage of all mental health consultations provided by allied health professionals. This finding lays the foundation for future work which could examine the effectiveness of the scheme in reducing inequity and investigating the economic benefits of the expanded initiative to the government and society.  2019 ISPORThe professional society for health economics and outcomes research EID: 2-s2.0-85073756466
1. **The validation of a telepresence scale for psychotherapy delivered in videoconference**
The Telepresence in Videoconference Scale (TVS) was developed and tested over several years, but its psychometric properties have not been formally documented. The aim of this study was to examine the reliability and factor structure of the TVS. A total of 157 participants completed the scale following a videoconference session with a psychotherapist delivered over four clinical trials. The TVS was submitted to an exploratory factor analysis using the Principal Components method and a Varimax rotation. Three factors were found: Physical Presence, Interaction, and Absorption. Inter-item correlations and Cronbachs alpha were conducted to measure the internal consistency of the scale. Discriminant validity and convergent validity were assessed with the Immersive Tendencies Questionnaire and the Distance Communication Comfort Scale. The results suggest that this revised version of the Telepresence in Videoconference Scale is a reliable and **valid** tool to measure clients sense of presence during psychotherapy sessions delivered over videoconference technologies. Future research could examine whether this scale may be used in different contexts and with different populations.  2018, Interactive Media Institute. All rights reserved. EID: 2-s2.0-85067878343
2. **Telepresence experienced in videoconference varies according to emotions involved in videoconference sessions**
Previous studies have linked telepresence to the strength of the therapeutic **relationship** experienced during telepsychotherapy. This finding comes as a surprise for many people who have been involved in a teleconference meeting, where telepresence is often considered weak. The aim of this study is to (re)evaluate the impact of emotional engagement on telepresence. Participants were randomly assigned to one of the two conditions: (a) emotionally charged verbal exchange **first** (followed by a more neutral verbal exchange), or (b) emotionally neutral verbal exchange **first** (followed by an emotionally charged verbal exchange). A distraction task was performed between the two verbal exchanges in videofoncerence. Results showed that verbal exchanges involving stronger emotions increase telepresence. These results may explain why telepresence is so high in telepsychotherapy. EID: 2-s2.0-83455200034
3. **Factors influencing mental health providers intention to use telepsychotherapy in First Nations communities**
Telemental health is the use of information and communications technologies and broadband networks to deliver mental health services and support wellness. Although numerous studies have demonstrated the efficiency and utility of telemental health, certain barriers may impede its implementation, including the attitudes of mental health service providers. The current study draws on the technology acceptance model (TAM) to understand the role of mental health service providers attitudes and perceptions of telemental health (psychotherapy delivered via videoconferencing) on their intention to use this technology with their patients. A sample of 205 broadly defined mental health service providers working on 32 First Nations reserves in the province of Quebec completed the questionnaire adapted to assess TAM for telepsychotherapy. Confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling provided evidence for the factor validity and reliability of the TAM in this sample. The key predictor of the intention to use telepsychotherapy was not mental health providers attitude toward telepsychotherapy, nor how much they expected this service to be complicated to use, but essentially how useful they expect it to be for their First Nations patients. If telemental health via videoconferencing is to be implemented in First Nations communities, it is essential to thoroughly demonstrate its utility to mental health providers. Perceived usefulness will have a positive impact on attitudes toward this technology, and perceived ease of use will positively influence perceived usefulness. Cultural issues specific to the populations receiving telemental health services may be more efficiently addressed from the angle of perceived usefulness.  2013, SAGE Publications.

4. **Assessing presence in videoconference telepsychotherapies: A complementary qualitative study on breaks in telepresence and intersubjectivity co-construction processes**
Assessing the efficacy of online psychotherapies is an important issue in eHealth. In the present research, we used an innovative approach to focus on the characteristics of breaks in interactions that impact the acceptance of the psychotherapy setting of a telepsychotherapy delivered in videoconference. We also tried to build a method to assess if the level of telepresence in online interactions would be influenced by the acceptance of the psychotherapy setting. Sessions of psychotherapy delivered in videoconference to two adults receiving CBT and two others receiving psychodynamic psychotherapy were analyzed to test the method. In this paper, we describe the methodology and illustrate preliminary results. An interactional grid was used to analyze verbal and non-verbal interactions, physical and social presence, and breaks in acceptance of the telepsychotherapy setting. This led to observe the interactional process of construction of enonciative co-presence, fundamental to allow people to experience intersubjectivity. This study is the **first** step towards a better understanding of the level of acceptance of the technological setting by patients and its influence on the interactions between them and psychologists.  2018, Interactive Media Institute.

5. **Telepsychology and video-interview [Tlpsychologie et visioconsultation]**
Telepsychology is an emerging field in present psychotherapeutic practices. There are different methods available to carry out psychotherapy at a distance. These methods more or less involve the participant's bodies. Videoconference is a technology that permits to users to see each other. This has an influence on interactions established at a distance. Video-interview is a method based on the adaptation online of the classical clinical face-to-face interview framework. Objectives: 1. Adapt the clinical interview framework online. Conceptualize a prototype device: http://www.ipsy.fr. 2. Compare the **relationship** between a patient and a psychologist during a face-to-face interview in a classical framework and on the online platform. Materials and methods: The sample of our study was composed of two groups of four participants. Participants were adults and did not have alterated **relationship** to reality. We compared the video-interviews realized with two groups of participants: one previously handled in a traditional framework and the **other** solely met through the platform. We used a qualitative method to analyze video-interviews recordings: a 12 items theme based grid. We were very attentive to ethical rules and data security all along the platform development process and after that in the use of the device. Results: Psychological processes activated in the context of video-interview are similar to those observed in traditional clinical consults, for both groups of participants. These results also show the tierce function of the device in the dual **relationship** between the patient and the clinical psychologist. These results open a reflexion on the process relative to the creation of an intersubjective **relationship** in telepsychotherapy. It seems that the study of the sense of presence might be useful to understand intersubjectivity in telepsychotherapy and more generally in digital relationships. Conclusions: A methodological work is still necessary to define telepsychotherapy. This work should include an ethical dimension, in order to preserve online users safety. Telepsychotherapy has many advantages, for example, it permits a better access to psychotherapy for isolated people. These people can be isolated geographically, or they might have mobility issues, or even psychological issues making it difficult for them to go in the psychologist office. Present boundaries are technical, but also methodological, with the lack of definition of an ethical and methodological framework of telepsychotherapy in France. We also notice the lack of longitudinal, quantitative and qualitative data on evaluation of telepsychotherapies efficacity. Also, some fundamental data should be explored theoretically, as the sense of presence.  2018 Elsevier Masson SAS EID: 2-s2.0-85042157143

Objective: We aimed to determine characteristics of patients receiving Medicare-funded face-to-face consultations by psychiatrists in a **rural** service with an established telemedicine service. Methods: For this study, 55 case-managed patients from four **rural** community **mental** **health** teams in South Australia provided information through questionnaires regarding psychological symptoms, quality of life, body mass index (BMI) and gave access to their Medicare data. Results: In a logistic regression, it was found that being younger was more likely associated with a Medicare psychiatric consultation (p<0.05). Participants with at least one recorded visit to a Medicare psychiatrist consultation also tended to have lower levels of psychological distress at the end of the 4-year period, have a higher BMI, and more general practitioner consultations. Conclusion: The study provides clinicians and policy makers with preliminary information on the subtle differences in clinical profile of patients seen by Medicare-funded psychiatrists within an established state-managed telepsychiatry service.

1. **Geriatric Telepsychiatry: Systematic Review and Policy Considerations**
Telemental **health** (TMH) for older patients has the potential to increase access to geriatric specialists, reduce travel times for patients and providers, and reduce ever growing healthcare costs. This systematic review article examines the literature regarding psychiatric assessment and treatment via telemedicine for geriatric patients. English language literature was searched using Ovid Medline, PubMed, and PsycINFO with search terms including telemedicine, telemental health, aging, and dementia. Abstracts were reviewed for relevance based on inclusion criteria. Multiple study types were reviewed, including open label, qualitative and randomized controlled trial study designs. Data was compiled regarding participants, study intervention, and outcomes. 76 articles were included. TMH was shown to be feasible and well accepted in the areas of inpatient and nursing **home** consultation, cognitive testing, **dementia** diagnosis and treatment, depression in integrated and collaborative care models, and psychotherapy. There is limited data on cost-effectiveness of TMH in the elderly. This article will discuss the current barriers to broader implementation of telemedicine for geriatric patients including reimbursement from the Medicare program. Medicare reimbursement for telemedicine is limited to **rural** areas, which does not allow for the widespread development of telemedicine programs. All Medicare beneficiaries would benefit from increased access to telemedicine services, not only those living in **rural** areas. As many elderly and disabled individuals have mobility problems, home-based telemedicine services should also be made available. There are efforts in Congress to expand the coverage of these services under Medicare, but strong advocacy will be needed to ensure these efforts are successful.  2018 EID: 2-s2.0-85056225259
2. **Technology Tools: Increasing Our Reach in National Surveillance of Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities**
Challenges in collecting comprehensive **health** surveillance data on people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) are numerous. A number of important issues and strategies are discussed in the articles contained in this special issue of Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities. In this article, we focus on the advances and tools available in the area of technology. We explore a number of possible sources including accessing big data such as analyzing **health** information contained in Medicaid and Medicare **health** databases. We also discuss some of the possibilities afforded to us by complementing Medicaid/Medicare database information with **health** information available in the myriad of electronic **health** records. Lastly, we explore other technologies available that might yield valuable **health** supports and information, including wearable devices, remote supports and other smart **home** technologies, telehealth and telepsychiatry, as well as looking at ways to access other technologies that collect **health** information (e.g., glucometer, **health** apps, connected exercise devices, etc.).

0. **Application of telepsychiatry: A preliminary study**
Telemedicine is the provision of professional medical services from sites removed from the patient. This study was conducted in order to assess the reliability of psychiatric evaluations via video-consultation. The inter- **rater** reliability was determined for each interviewing condition by employing the reliability-testing paradigm in which the brief psychiatric rating scale (BPRS) and the interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) are used. The inter- **rater** reliability scores between face-to-face interviews and interviews conducted by **video** at two different levels of image qualities were compared by the authors. Reliability was found to be in perfect **agreement** in each of the interviewing conditions. This study verifies that telepsychiatry is a reliable method of assessing patient conditions. It may be used to provide much needed mental health-care services to patients whose access to them is restricted. EID: 2-s2.0-0034014241
1. **The reliability of telepsychiatry for a neuropsychiatric assessment**
Objective: To determine whether or not the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS), an examination that relies on visual judgments, can be reliably measured via **video** conferencing equipment. Methods: AIMS scores were assessed by two independent raters in face-to-face contact with the subject and two raters observing remotely via audio-visual transmission. We determined inter-rater reliabilities using the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC). We assessed if the condition of the **rater** influenced the ICC. We distinguished between whether the **rater** was physically in the room with the subject or was connected via video. We then statistically compared the differences between these conditions. Results: There were no significant statistical differences between the raters, which could be attributed to the condition while assessing involuntary movements using the AIMS instrument. Regardless of whether this assessment was conducted by direct observation or via **video** conferencing equipment, the results were reliable to the same degree. Conclusion: Reliable neuropsychiatric assessments can be conducted using telemedicine even if primarily visual input is evaluated.  Copyright 2011, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. EID: 2-s2.0-79955081873
2. **Transcultural psychiatry made simple - Asynchronous telepsychiatry as an approach to providing culturally relevant care**
Objective: To examine the feasibility and diagnostic reliability of asynchronous telepsychiatry (ATP) consultations in Spanish and ATP consultation with Spanish-to-English translation. Subjects and Methods: Twenty-four interviews of Spanish-speaking patients were videorecorded by a bilingual clinician who also collected patient history data and gave the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders (SCID-I) to each patient. The ATP data (video of the **interview** and patient history) were forwarded for psychiatric consultation and a diagnostic assessment by the investigators. The ATP data were then examined separately by two Spanish-speaking psychiatrists, before being translated into English and then re-examined by two English-speaking psychiatrists. Agreement between the expert diagnoses of the investigators and the diagnoses from the Spanish consultations, the Spanish-to-English translated consultations, and the SCID-I results was assessed using kappa statistics. Results: We found acceptable levels of **agreement** for major diagnostic groupings among the Spanish- and English-speaking psychiatrists. Kappa values for diagnostic **agreement** between the expert and the translated consultations, the original language consultations, and the SCID-I were at least 0.52 (percentage agreement, 79%) and higher. Conclusions: ATP consultations in Spanish, and those translated from Spanish to English, are feasible, and broad diagnostic reliability was achieved. The ATP process allows for rapid language translation. This approach could be useful across national boundaries and in numerous ethnic groups. Cross-language ATP may also offer significant benefits over the use of real-time interpreting services and has the potential to improve the quality of care by allowing for the addition of culturally relevant information.

3. **Telepsychiatry: Assessment of televideo psychiatric interview reliability with present- and next-generation internet infrastructures**
Objective: We assessed the reliability of remote **video** psychiatric interviews conducted via the internet using narrow and broad bandwidths. Method: Televideo psychiatric interviews conducted with 42 in-patients with chronic schizophrenia using two bandwidths (narrow, 128 kilobits/s; broad, 2 megabits/s) were assessed in terms of **agreement** with face-to-face interviews in a test-retest fashion. As a control, **agreement** was assessed between face-to-face interviews. Psychiatric symptoms were rated using the Oxford version of the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), and **agreement** between interviews was estimated as the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Results: The ICC was significantly lower in the narrow bandwidth than in the broad bandwidth and the control for both positive symptoms score and total score. Conclusion: While reliability of televideo psychiatric interviews is insufficient using the present narrow-band internet infrastructure, the next generation of infrastructure (broad-band) may permit reliable diagnostic interviews.

0. **Effectiveness of an online CBT-i intervention and a face-to-face treatment for shift work sleep disorder: A comparison of sleep diary data**
In western societies, about one in six employees works in shifts. Shiftwork is associated with a number of poor somatic and psychological health outcomes, especially **sleep** issues. Higher rates of absenteeism and accidents in the workplace are possible consequences. Still, prevention programs and **treatment** options that are specifically tailored to shift-workers needs are rare. We devised a 4-week online **cognitive** behavioral therapy for **insomnia** (CBT-I) intervention (n = 21) and compared **sleep** outcomes to a face-to-face outpatient **treatment** for shift-workers (n = 12) using a **sleep** diary and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). In the online sample, measures also included the World Health Organization wellbeing questionnaire (WHO-5) and the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). In the outpatient sample, the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II), the Montgomerysberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) were administered. Results showed significant improvements in **sleep** efficiency by 7.2% in the online sample and 7.7% in the outpatient sample. However, no significant difference was found in the rate of improvement in **sleep** efficiency across four weeks of **treatment** between the samples. In the online sample, the wellbeing (WHO-5) and **insomnia** symptoms (ISI) scores were significantly improved following the CBT-I intervention (p < 0.004 and p < 0.002 respectively). In the outpatient sample, symptoms of depression (BDI-II and MADRS scores) and **insomnia** symptoms (PSQI scores) improved significantly following the CBT-I intervention. In summary, CBT-I significantly improved **sleep** efficiency in both the online and outpatient samples, in addition to wellbeing, symptoms of insomnia, and depression. The findings of this study demonstrate online CBT-I as a feasible approach for treating **insomnia** in shift-workers. Future randomized controlled trials are needed.  2019 by the authors.

1. **The Sleep Or Mood Novel Adjunctive therapy (SOMNA) trial: A study protocol for a randomised controlled trial evaluating an internet-delivered cognitive behavioural therapy program for insomnia on outcomes of standard treatment for depression in men**
Background: Insomnia is a significant risk factor for depression onset, can result in more disabling depressive illness, and is a common residual symptom following **treatment** cessation that can increase the risk of relapse. Internet-based **cognitive** behavioural therapy for **insomnia** has demonstrated efficacy and acceptability to men who are less likely than women to seek help in standard care. We aim to evaluate whether internet delivered **cognitive** behavioural therapy for **insomnia** as an adjunct to a standard depression therapeutic plan can lead to improved mood outcomes. Methods/Design: Male participants aged 50 years or more, meeting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders criteria for current Major Depressive Episode and/or Dysthymia and self-reported **insomnia** symptoms, will be screened to participate in a single-centre double-blind randomised controlled trial with two parallel groups involving adjunctive internet-delivered **cognitive** behavioural therapy for **insomnia** and an internet-based control program. The trial will consist of a nine-week **insomnia** intervention period with a six-month follow-up period. During the **insomnia** intervention period participants will have their depression management coordinated by a psychiatrist using standard guideline-based depression treatments. The study will be conducted in urban New South Wales, Australia, where 80 participants from primary and secondary care and direct from the local community will be recruited. The primary outcome is change in the severity of depressive symptoms from baseline to week 12. Discussion: This study will provide evidence on whether a widely accessible, evidence-based, internet-delivered **cognitive** behavioural therapy for **insomnia** intervention can lead to greater improvements than standard **treatment** for depression alone, in a group who traditionally do not readily access psychotherapy. The study is designed to establish effect size, feasibility and processes associated with implementing e-health solutions alongside standard clinical care, to warrant undertaking a larger more definitive clinical trial.

2. **Feasibility of Group Cognitive-Behavioral Treatment of Insomnia Delivered by Clinical Video Telehealth**
Background: Clinical video telehealth provides a means for increasing access to psychotherapy. Insomnia is prevalent, is associated with a number of negative sequelae, and can be effectively managed with **cognitive** behavioral **treatment** of **insomnia** (CBT-I). Telehealth technologies can provide a means for increasing access to CBT-I. Materials and Methods: The Tele-Insomnia program is a Veterans Health Administration (VHA) initiative in which CBT-I is delivered in a group format by telehealth. Veterans received six weekly sessions of group CBT-I, completing the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and daily **sleep** diaries throughout treatment. Paired-samples t-tests were used to examine differences in each measure from the first to the last session of treatment. Results: There were statistically and clinically significant improvements in the ISI and all **sleep** diary variables with the exception of total **sleep** time. Video quality was excellent, and there were few connectivity problems. Conclusions: Clinical video telehealth technology can be used to deliver group CBT-I in a manner that produces clinically significant improvement. This model is scalable and has been used to develop a national clinical telehealth program.  Copyright 2016, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2016. EID: 2-s2.0-85002882926

0. **Telephone-adapted Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction (tMBSR) for patients awaiting kidney transplantation**
Background Patients with progressive **kidney** disease experience increasing physiologic and psychosocial stressors and declining health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Methods We conducted a randomized, active-controlled, open-label trial to test whether a Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction (MBSR) **program** delivered in a novel workshop-teleconference format would reduce symptoms and improve HRQOL in patients awaiting **kidney** transplantation. Sixty-three **transplant** candidates were randomized to one of two arms: i) telephone-adapted MBSR (tMBSR, an 8-week **program** of meditation and yoga); or ii) a telephone-based support group (tSupport). Participants completed self-report questionnaires at baseline, post-intervention, and after 6-months. Anxiety, measured by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) post-intervention served as the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included: depression, sleep quality, pain, fatigue, and HRQOL assessed by SF-12 Physical and Mental Component Summaries (PCS, MCS). Results 55 patients (age 54  12 yrs) attended their assigned **program** (tMBSR, n = 27; tSupport, n = 28). 49% of patients had elevated anxiety at baseline. Changes in anxiety were small and did not differ by treatment group post-intervention or at follow-up. However, tMBSR significantly improved mental HRQOL at follow-up: + 6.2 points on the MCS - twice the minimum clinically important difference (95% CI: 1.66 to 10.8, P = 0.01). A large percentage of tMBSR participants ( 90%) practiced mindfulness and reported it helpful for **stress** management. Conclusions Neither mindfulness training nor a support group resulted in clinically meaningful reductions in anxiety. In contrast, finding that tMBSR was more effective than tSupport for bolstering mental HRQOL during the wait for a **kidney** **transplant** is encouraging and warrants further investigation.

1. **Telephone-adapted mindfulness-based stress reduction (tMBSR) for patients awaiting kidney transplantation: Trial design, rationale and feasibility**
Mindfulness-based **stress** reduction (MBSR) has demonstrated benefits for stress-related symptoms; however, for patients with burdensome treatment regimens, multiple co-morbidities and mobility impairment, time and travel requirements pose barriers to MBSR training. Purpose: To describe the design, rationale and feasibility results of Journeys to Wellness, a clinical trial of mindfulness training delivered in a novel workshop and teleconference format. The trial aim is to reduce symptoms and improve quality of life in people waiting for a **kidney** transplant. Methods: The standard 8-week MBSR **program** was reconfigured for delivery as two in-person workshops separated in time by six weekly teleconferences (tMBSR). A time and attention comparison condition (tSupport) was created using the workshop-telephone format. Feasibility results: Kidney **transplant** candidates (N. =. 63) were randomly assigned to tMBSR or tSupport: 87% (n. =. 55) attended . 1 class, and for these, attendance was high (6.6. . 1.8 tMBSR and 7.0. . 1.4 tSupport sessions). Fidelity monitoring found that all treatment elements were delivered as planned and few technical problems occurred. Patients in both groups reported high treatment satisfaction, but more tMBSR (83%) than tSupport (43%) participants expected their intervention to be quite a bit or extremely useful for managing their health. Symptoms and quality of life outcomes collected before (baseline, 8. weeks and 6. months) and after **kidney** transplantation (2, 6 and 12. months) will be analyzed for efficacy. Conclusions: tMBSR is an accessible intervention that may be useful to people with a wide spectrum of **health** conditions. Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT01254214.  2015 Elsevier Inc.

Design Telephone survey. Setting State Medicaid programs. Participants State Medicaid directors. Interventions Not applicable. Main outcome measure Descriptive. Results Half of the 35 **state** Medicaid programs contacted reimbursed at least some telemedicine services other than radiology in 2002. The primary reason for reimbursing for telemedicine is to make services available when there is no local practitioner. Consultation and evaluation and management services were most likely to be reimbursed (12 states). Seven **state** programs reimbursed telepsychology, and 4 states reported reimbursing for telespeech and language pathology, physical therapy, or occupational therapy. Conclusions Telemedicine helps Medicaid programs deliver specialized care to locations with provider shortages. Telerehabilitation is not yet widespread, despite its potential benefit to people with disabilities who cannot travel to a clinic for rehabilitation therapy. Most Medicaid programs calculate the financial costs and patient benefits when considering payment policies, and about half of states require a **state** law to allow payment for telerehabilitation. Minnesota, Hawaii, and Nebraska, among the responding states, currently reimburse for telerehabilitation.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), stress-related chronic diseases are the main source of death in developed countries. During the last decade, e-mental health, telepsychology or telepsychiatry interventions are showing its growing potential due to the gradual global adoption of the internet and mobile phone technologies. A significant number of studies have concluded that mindfulness helps to reduce physical and psychological symptoms of **stress** related to various **health** concerns and that it is a psychological skill that can be trained. The purpose of this online research study is to gather the participants socio-demographics as well as **stress** and mindfulness data during an online mindfulness training program. Sustained attention and the **state** of mindfulness experienced in single meditation sessions are also tracked and stored. Correlational analysis yielded to a statistically significant relationship between high scores in **stress** and low scores in mindfulness facets (p <.001) and between **state** and trait aspects of mindfulness (p <.01).  2012 Interactive Media Institute.

0. **The SAGES telephone neuropsychological battery: correlation with in-person measures**
Objective: Neuropsychological **test** batteries are administered in **person** to assess cognitive function in both clinical and research settings. However, in-person administration holds a number of logistical challenges that makes it difficult to use in large or remote populations or for multiple serial assessments over time. The purpose of this descriptive study was to determine whether a telephone-administered neuropsychological **test** battery correlated well with in-person testing. Methods: Fifty English-speaking patients without dementia, over 70 years old, and part of a cohort of patients in a prospective cohort study examining cognitive outcomes following elective surgery were enrolled in this study. Five well-validated neuropsychological tests were administered by telephone to each participant by a trained interviewer within 24 weeks of the most recent in-person interview. Tests included the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised, Digit Span, Category Fluency, Phonemic Fluency, and Boston Naming Test. A General Cognitive Performance composite score was calculated from individual subtest scores as a Z-score. Results: Mean age was 74.9 years (SD = 4.1), 66% female, and 4% non-White. Mean and interquartile distributions of telephone scores were similar to in-person scores. Correlation analysis of **test** scores revealed significant correlations between telephone and in-person results for each individual subtest, as well as for the overall composite score. A BlandAltman plot revealed no bias or trends in scoring for either **test** administration type. Conclusions: In this descriptive study, the telephone version of a neuropsychological **test** battery correlated well with the in-person version and may provide a feasible supplement in clinical and research applications.

1. **A Flexible and Integrated System for the Remote Acquisition of Neuropsychological Data in Stroke Research**
Background: Neuropsychological testing is a central aspect of stroke research because it provides critical information about the cognitive-behavioral status of stroke survivors, as well as the diagnosis and treatment of stroke-related disorders. Standard neuropsychological methods rely upon face-to-face interactions between a patient and researcher, which creates geographic and logistical barriers that impede research progress and treatment advances. Introduction: To overcome these barriers, we created a flexible and integrated system for the remote acquisition of neuropsychological data (RAND). The system we developed has a secure architecture that permits collaborative videoconferencing. The system supports shared audiovisual feeds that can provide continuous virtual interaction between a participant and researcher throughout a testing session. Shared presentation and computing controls can be used to deliver auditory and visual **test** items adapted from **standard** face-to-face materials or execute computer-based assessments. Spoken and manual responses can be acquired, and the components of the session can be recorded for offline data analysis. Materials and Methods: To evaluate its feasibility, our RAND system was used to administer a speech-language **test** battery to 16 stroke survivors with a variety of communication, sensory, and motor impairments. The sessions were initiated virtually without prior face-to-face instruction in the RAND technology or **test** battery. Results: Neuropsychological data were successfully acquired from all participants, including those with limited technology experience, and those with a communication, sensory, or motor impairment. Furthermore, participants indicated a high level of satisfaction with the RAND system and the remote assessment that it permits. Conclusions: The results indicate the feasibility of using the RAND system for virtual home-based neuropsychological assessment without prior face-to-face contact between a participant and researcher. Because our RAND system architecture uses off-the-shelf technology and software, it can be duplicated without specialized expertise or equipment. In sum, our RAND system offers a readily available and promising alternative to face-to-face neuropsychological assessment in stroke research.  Copyright 2016, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2016.

2. **Videoconference-based mini mental state examination: A validation study**
Background: Neuropsychological testing is a prime criterion of good practice to document cognitive deficits in a rapidly aging population. Telecommunication technologies may overcome limitations related to **test** administration. We compared performance of the Italian videoconference-based version of the Mini Mental State Examination (VMMSE) with performance of the **standard** MMSE administered face-to-face (F2F), to validate the Italian version of the 28-item VMMSE. Materials and Methods: To validate the Italian version of the VMMSE, we compared its performance with **standard** F2F. The sample (n=342) was administered three VMMSEs within 6 weeks after F2F testing. We identified the optimal cutoff through the receiver operating characteristic curve, as well as the VMMSE consistency through inter- and intrarater reliability (Inter/RR and Intra/RR) analysis. Results: We found high levels of sensitivity and specificity for the optimal VMMSE cutoff identification and an accuracy of 0.96 (95% confidence interval 0.94-0.98). Intra/RR and inter/RR were highly significant. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that VMMSE is a valid instrument in clinical and research screening and monitoring of subjects affected by cognitive disorders. This study shows a significant correlation between videoconference assessment and the F2F one, providing an important impetus to expand studies and the knowledge about the usefulness of tele-assistance services. Our findings have important implications for both longitudinal assistance and clinical care of demented patients.  2013 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. EID: 2-s2.0-84889690302
3. **A Pilot Trial of Neuropsychological Evaluations Conducted via Telemedicine in the Veterans Health Administration**
Introduction: Many veterans live in rural areas distant from Veterans Affairs Medical Centers (VAMCs) and receive primary medical care from community-based outpatient clinics (CBOCs). These veterans often must travel great distances to the nearest VAMC for neuropsychological evaluations, resulting in poor access to care, travel reimbursement costs, fee-basis evaluations of uncontrolled quality, and driving safety concerns. Return trips for feedback compound complications. Accordingly, we initiated a pilot trial of neuropsychological evaluation and feedback via telemedicine (i.e., clinical videoconferencing). Subjects and Methods: Participants were veterans referred for neuropsychological evaluation from a rural CBOC 115 miles from the regional VAMC. All veterans were given the choice to undergo evaluation at the CBOC via telemedicine or in-person at the VAMC. Telemedicine equipment allowed presentation of digitized material with simultaneous patient observation. Testing materials were organized in numbered folders and given to veterans by CBOC clerks immediately prior to evaluation. Clerks returned completed materials via facsimile. Results: Fifteen veterans from the rural CBOC were seen for neuropsychological evaluation. Eight chose telemedicine evaluation. Groups based on evaluation modality appeared similar on demographics, referral basis, resulting neuropsychiatric diagnoses, and follow-through on recommendations. No significant technical or clinical difficulties were encountered, and veterans reported satisfaction with telemedicine. All veterans requested feedback via telemedicine. Conclusions: Neuropsychological evaluation via telemedicine is feasible and appears comparable to in-person evaluation. Experiences are encouraging and consistent with the broader literature on the acceptance of and satisfaction with clinical videoconferencing. Future studies will assess possible psychometric issues in clinical populations.  Copyright 2012, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2012. EID: 2-s2.0-84869001703
4. **Teleneuropsychology: Evidence for video teleconference-based neuropsychological assessment**
The use of videoconference technology to deliver health care diagnostics and treatment continues to grow at a rapid pace. Telepsychiatry and telepsychology applications are well-accepted by patients and providers, and both diagnostic and treatment outcomes have generally been similar to traditional face-to-face interactions. Preliminary applications of videoconference-based neuropsychological assessment (teleneuropsychology) have yielded promising results in the feasibility and reliability of several **standard** tests, although large-scale studies are lacking. This investigation was conducted to determine the reliability of video teleconference (VTC) - based neuropsychological assessment using a brief battery of **standard** neuropsychological tests commonly used in the evaluation of known or suspected dementia. Tests included the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised, Digit Span forward and backward, short form Boston Naming Test, Letter and Category Fluency, and Clock Drawing. Tests were administered via VTC and in-person to subjects, counterbalanced using alternate **test** forms and **standard** instructions. Two hundred two adult subjects were tested in both rural and urban settings, including 83 with cognitive impairment and 119 healthy controls. We found highly similar results across VTC and in-person conditions, with significant intraclass correlations (mean=.74; range: 0.55-0.91) between **test** scores. Findings remained consistent in subjects with or without cognitive impairment and in persons with MMSE scores as low as 15. VTC-based neuropsychological testing is a valid and reliable alternative to traditional face-to-face assessment using selected measures. More VTC-based studies using additional tests in different populations are needed to fully explore the utility of this new testing medium.

5. **Usability analysis of a system for cognitive rehabilitation, "gradior", in a Spanish Region**
Objective: The main aim of our research is to assess the use, satisfaction, and pedagogy of software for neuropsychological rehabilitation by computer, called "Gradior," to obtain relevant information on the impact of information and communications technology on people with severe and prolonged mental illness. Methods: To evaluate the usability and satisfaction standards, the questionnaire "Usability survey on the use of the cognitive rehabilitation and assessment program by computer" was completed by 83 patients of the Rodrguez Chamorro Hospital. Results: The results of the study show that Gradior has 81.2% acceptance and 83.7% general assessment. This indicates that those who responded to the survey consider that the Gradior program improves cognitive functions and abilities in patients with severe and prolonged mental illness and therefore their quality of life. Conclusion: This research is oriented toward professionals of the Health Area and Systems Engineers, who develop software for neuropsychological rehabilitation with neurocognitive deficit. The purpose is to make the learning process more effective among the people who use it and to improve usability for specific groups. We hope that the reading of the work contributes to the activities, techniques and materials planned are in accordance with the needs of the population affected with cognitive disorders.  2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

A 77-year-old woman who had been previously diagnosed with a major neurocognitive disorder became highly agitated and aggressive in a long-term care facility. She did not respond to intramuscular (IM) haloperidol plus lorazepam and had to be transported to the local emergency department (ED). In the ambulance, she remained highly agitated and was given 200 mg IM ketamine. Within minutes of receiving this, she de-escalated dramatically with no apparent adverse effects and remained stable for several days. Although ketamine has been used recently in pre-hospital settings and EDs to reduce agitated behavior, there has been little if any investigation of its potential for reducing behavior disturbances in patients who suffer from major neurocognitive disorders. Ketamine could potentially be a promising treatment option for this population, but more research is needed.  2018 EID: 2-s2.0-85044665275
1. **Program evaluation of a telepsychiatry service for older adults connecting a university-affiliated geriatric center to a rural psychogeriatric outreach service in Northwest Ontario, Canada**
ABSTRACT Background: Weekly telepsychiatry consultations have been provided since 2002 to six communities in Northwest Ontario. Staff from a single community psychogeriatric outreach service who work within these communities facilitate the referrals. Methods: The program evaluation included (a) a chart review of the last 100 referrals, (b) analysis of **patient** and staff evaluations, (c) a survey mailed to all physicians in referring communities, and (d) three focus groups of staff working in local community agencies. Results: The mean age at the time of consultation was 76.7 years. Sixty-eight percent of patients were females. The most frequent diagnoses were **dementia** (54%), depression (28%), and mild cognitive impairment (19%). The most frequent medication recommendations were antidepressants or cholinesterase inhibitors. Two hundred ninety-four **patient** assessments and case consultations were carried out between 2002 and 2009. Post-session evaluation surveys rated the provision of information, whether objectives were met, and overall usefulness of recommendations. The mean scores for these questions on a 5-point scale were between 4.6 and 4.85. Referring physicians were confident and satisfied with the recommendations made for their patients. All planned to continue to use telepsychiatry as a care option for the future. The focus groups added useful information about challenges and potential barriers to utilizing the program. Conclusions: The program was rated as being highly valued across all modalities of evaluation. Members of the referring team believe that access to a **geriatric** psychiatrist has broadened the team's knowledge base, its use of assessment tools, and increased their ability to better construct their patients' treatment plans.

2. **ECHO-AGE: An Innovative Model of Geriatric Care for Long-Term Care Residents With Dementia and Behavioral Issues**
Objectives: To design, implement, and assess the pilot phase of an innovative, remote case-based video-consultation program called ECHO-AGE that links experts in the management of behavior disorders in patients with **dementia** to nursing home care providers. Design: Pilot study involving surveying of participating long-term care sites regarding utility of recommendations and **resident** outcomes. Setting: Eleven long-term care sites in Massachusetts and Maine. Participants: An interprofessional specialty team at a tertiary care center and staff from 11 long-term care sites. Intervention: Long-term care sites presented challenging cases regarding residents with **dementia** and/or delirium related behavioral issues to specialists via video-conferencing. Methods: Baseline **resident** characteristics and follow-up data regarding compliance with ECHO-AGE recommendations, **resident** improvement, hospitalization, and mortality were collected from the long-term care sites. Results: Forty-seven residents, with a mean age of 82years, were presented during the ECHO-AGE pilot period. Eighty-three percent of residents had a history of **dementia** and 44% were taking antipsychotic medications. The most **common** reasons for presentation were agitation, intrusiveness, and paranoia. Behavioral plans were recommended in 72.3% of patients. Suggestions for medication adjustments were also frequent. ECHO-AGE recommendations were completely or partially followed in 88.6% of residents. When recommendations were followed, sites were much more likely to report **clinical** improvement (74% vs 20%, P<.03). Hospitalization was also less **common** among residents for whom recommendations were followed. Conclusions: The results suggest that a case-based video-consultation program can be successful in improving the care of elders with **dementia** and/or delirium related behavioral issues by linking specialists with long-term care providers.  2014.

3. **Identifying undiagnosed dementia in residential care veterans: Comparing telemedicine to in-person clinical examination**
Background: Dementia is a **common** but frequently undiagnosed problem in aging. Barriers to early diagnosis include a lack of routine screening for **dementia** and a lack of access to specialty consultative services. We conducted a pilot study to see if telemedicine could provide reliable, accurate **geriatric** consultative services to evaluate patients for **dementia** who were residing at remote sites. Methods: This was a prospective cohort study that compared the diagnostic reliability of telemedicine to an in-person examination for dementia. Eligible subjects were residents of a Washington State Veterans' Home, age 60 years or older, with no prior diagnosis of dementia. Eligible subjects were screened for **dementia** using the 7-Minute Screen. Veterans who screened positive and consented to participate in the study received an in-person neuropsychiatric evaluation at baseline, and then both telemedicine and in-person examinations for **dementia** conducted by experienced **geriatric** psychiatrists. The accuracy of the telemedicine diagnosis was estimated by comparing it to the diagnosis from the **clinical** examination. Three **geriatric** psychiatrists who were blinded to the results of the **clinical** examination conducted the telemedicine and in-person examinations. We also assessed attitudes of the subjects and **geriatric** psychiatrists towards the telemedicine sessions. Results: Eighteen of 85 subjects screened were 'positive' for **dementia** on the 7 Minute Screen. Of these, 16 consented to participate in the telemedicine study. Twelve of the 16 subjects were subsequently diagnosed with **dementia** by the telemedicine examination. The telemedicine diagnoses were in 100% agreement with the diagnoses from the in-person **clinical** examinations. Moreover, the subjects reported a high degree of satisfaction with the telemedicine experience and that they would like to have further care through telemedicine in the future. The **geriatric** psychiatrists reported technical difficulties with the audio-visual quality of telemedicine in the initial phases of the project that resolved as familiarity with the telemedicine equipment increased. None of these problems had an adverse impact on the diagnostic accuracy of telemedicine. Conclusions: We found that telemedicine was as accurate as an in-person **clinical** examination in establishing the diagnosis of dementia. In addition, subjects reported a high degree of satisfaction with telemedicine and a willingness to participate in telemedicine **clinical** care in the future. Given the large increase in the aging population and the shortage of **geriatric** psychiatrists nationally, it appears that telemedicine may be a promising means to expand the availability of **geriatric** psychiatric consultation to remote areas.

4. **Cognitive intervention for community-dwelling older persons with memory problems: Telemedicine versus face-to-face treatment**
Background: Memory complaints and decline in cognitive function are **common** in the elederly. Cognitive intervention has been shown to be beneficial in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, few community-based cognitive intervention programs are available in Hong Kong. The aim of this project is to examine and compare the feasibility, acceptability, and **clinical** outcome of a cognitive intervention program for older patients with mild cognitive impairment and mild **dementia** using telemedicine versus a conventional face-to-face method. Methods: Community-dwelling older subjects with mild **dementia** or mild cognitive impairments were recruited from a community center. A total of 12 sessions of assessment and cognitive intervention were conducted via videoconferencing or by face-to-face method. Assessment included: Cantonese version of Mini Mental State Examination (C-MMSE), Cantonese version of Rivermead Behavioural Memory test (C-RBMT) and Hierarchic Dementia Scale (HDS). Results: Twenty-two clients were recruited. There was significant and comparable cognitive improvement in clients in both treatment arms. The videoconference arm was highly accepted by the clients and the community center. Overall compliance rate of participants was above 95%. Conclusions: Telemedicine was a feasible, effective and acceptable means in providing cognitive assessment and intervention to older persons with mild cognitive deficits. Promoting such a program to other community settings would further enhance the accessibility of **dementia** service to the community. Copyright  2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. EID: 2-s2.0-15344348363

0. **The Childrens Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Telemental Health Treatment Study: Caregiver Outcomes**
The Childrens Attention-deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Telemental Health Treatment Study (CATTS) tested the hypotheses that children and caregivers who received guideline-based treatment delivered through a hybrid telehealth service delivery model would experience greater improvements in outcomes than children and caregivers receiving treatment via a comparison delivery model. Here, we present caregiver outcomes. 88 primary care providers (PCPs) in seven geographically underserved communities referred 223 children (ages 5.5  12.9years) to the randomized controlled trial. Over 22weeks, children randomized to the CATTS service delivery model received six sessions of telepsychiatry and six sessions of caregiver **behavior** management training provided in person by community therapists who were trained and supervised remotely. Children randomized to the comparison Augmented Primary Care (APC) service model received management in primary care augmented by a single telepsychiatry consultation. Caregiver outcomes included changes in distress, as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Parenting Stress Index (PSI), Caregiver Strain Questionnaire (CSQ) and Family Empowerment Scale (FES). Caregivers completed five assessments. Multilevel mixed effects regression modeling tested for differences between the two service delivery models in caregiver outcomes from baseline to 25weeks. Compared to caregivers of children in the APC model, caregivers of children in the CATTS service model showed statistically significantly greater improvements on the PHQ-9 ( = -1.41, 95% CI = [2.74, 0.08], p <.05), PSI ( = 4.59, 95% CI = [7.87,  1.31], p <.001), CSQ ( = 5.41, 95% CI = [ 8.58, 2.24], p <.001) and FES ( = 6.69, 95% CI = [2.32, 11.06], p <.01). Improvement in **child** ADHD symptoms mediated improved caregiver scores on the PSI and CSQ. Improvement in **child** ODD behaviors mediated caregiver CSQ scores. The CATTS trial supports the effectiveness of a hybrid telehealth service delivery model for reducing distress in caregivers of children with ADHD and suggests a mechanism through whichthe service model affected caregiver distress.  2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

1. **Parental attitudes to a telehealth parent coaching intervention for autism spectrum disorder**
Introduction: This study examined the potential feasibility of tele-delivered **parent** coaching in a rural area of Italy through a survey of parents attitudes towards this type of intervention. Methods: Parents of all children up to six years of age registered with a diagnosis of **autism** **spectrum** disorder at the clinic catering for the area were invited to take part in the study. The final sample consisted of 43 parents. Results: Parents with worse Internet skills and those who reported lower levels of satisfaction with currently received services were less likely to be willing to enrol. There was a trend for parents with lower self-efficacy to be less likely to enrol. Educational level, previous experience of video-calling, travel time to the clinic and childs level of ability were not associated with the choice of enrolment. Discussion: Implications for strategies to contrast barriers to adoption and strengthen implementation plans are discussed.  2016,  The Author(s) 2016. EID: 2-s2.0-85018777751
2. **Using telepsychology to provide a group parenting program: A preliminary evaluation of effectiveness**
Telepsychology offers the potential to reach rural and underserved children and families with mental health concerns. The current study evaluated the effects of using videoconferencing technology to deliver an evidence-based parenting program, the Group Triple P Positive Parenting Program (Group Triple P; Turner, Markie-Dadds, & Sanders, 2002), with families who had a **child** experiencing behavioral problems. Using a pre/post design, families (N = 13) from low socioeconomic backgrounds in Kentucky completed the Group Triple P via a videoconferencing delivery format. A benchmarking strategy (Weersing & Hamilton, 2005) indicated that treatment effect sizes for the videoconferencing format were generally comparable to treatment effect sizes for Group Triple P studies conducted in-person. Specifically, **child** **behavior** and parenting outcomes were similar across delivery formats. Implications of the study's findings and future directions for telepsychology research and practice with underserved families and children are discussed.  2015 American Psychological Association.

3. **Usability and reliability of a remotely administered adult autism assessment, the autism diagnostic observation schedule (ADOS) module 4**
Introduction: The Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) Module 4 is an **autism** assessment designed for verbally fluent adolescents and adults. Because of a shortage of available clinical expertise, it can be difficult for adults to receive a proper **autism** **spectrum** disorder (ASD) diagnostic assessment. A potential option to address this shortage is remote assessment. The objective of this study was to examine the feasibility, usability, and reliability of administering the ADOS Module 4 remotely using the Versatile and Integrated System for Telerehabilitation (VISYTER). Materials and Methods: VISYTER consists of computer stations at the client site and clinician site for video communication and a Web portal for managing and coordinating the assessment process. Twenty-three adults with an ASD diagnosis participated in a within-subject crossover design study in which both a remote ADOS and a face-to-face ADOS were administered. After completing the remote ADOS, participants completed a satisfaction survey. Results: Participant satisfaction with the remote ADOS delivery system was high. The kappa value was greater than 0.61 on 21 of 31 ADOS items. There was substantial agreement on ADOS classification (i.e., diagnosis) between assessments delivered face-to-face versus assessments delivered remotely (interclass coefficient=0.92). Non-agreement may have been due to outside factors or practice effect despite a washout period. Conclusions: The results of this study demonstrate that an **autism** assessment designed to be delivered face to face can be administered remotely using an integrated Web-based system with high levels of usability and reliability.

4. **An integrated telehealth system for remote administration of an adult autism assessment**
We developed a telehealth system to administer an **autism** assessment remotely. The remote assessment system integrates videoconferencing, stimuli presentation, recording, image and video presentation, and electronic assessment scoring into an intuitive software platform. This is an advancement over existing technologies used in telemental health, which currently require several devices. The number of children, adolescents, and adults with **autism** **spectrum** disorders (ASDs) has increased dramatically over the past 20 years and is expected to continue to increase in coming years. In general, there are not many clinicians trained in either the diagnosis or treatment of adults with ASD. Given the number of adults with **autism** in need, a remote assessment system can potentially provide a solution to the lack of trained clinicians. The goal is to make the remote assessment system as close to face-to-face assessment as possible, yet versatile enough to support deployment in underserved areas. The primary challenge to achieving this goal is that the assessment requires social interaction that appears natural and fluid, so the remote system needs to be able to support fluid natural interaction. For this study we developed components to support this type of interaction and integrated these components into a system capable of supporting the entire autistic assessment protocol. We then implemented the system and evaluated the system on real patients. The results suggest that we have achieved our goal in developing a system with high-quality interaction that is easy to use.

6. **A web-based tutorial for parents of young children with Autism: Results from a pilot study**
Objective: Early intervention can significantly improve long-term outcomes for children with autism. Unfortunately, many children do not receive early intervention services due to a critical shortage of trained professionals in this area. To bridge this gap, we evaluated a Web-based **parent** training tutorial (Enhancing Interactions), based on evidence-based practices and utilizing the Web-based platform to maximize learning. Methods: Twenty-three parents with a **child** between 18 months and 6 years with an **autism** **spectrum** disorder participated. Pre-and posttest scores of parents' knowledge were used to evaluate tutorial effectiveness. The system usability scale (SUS) evaluated technical user-friendliness and the user satisfaction questionnaire (USQ), gauged satisfaction with content. Results: The mean number of correct items on the posttest significantly increased, from 12.6 to 20.4, p<0.001. The mean SUS score was 85 (standard deviation=17), corresponding to a score of "excellent." All participants found the tutorial user friendly, well integrated, and 96% (all but one participant) thought it was easy to use, felt confident using the technical features, and would use a tutorial like this again. On the USQ, all participants found that the tutorial was well organized, clearly presented, and easy to understand; that it increased their knowledge about communicating with their child; and that they felt capable of applying these techniques with their child. Conclusions: The tutorial appears effective in increasing parents' knowledge with high user satisfaction.  2011, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. EID: 2-s2.0-82455179552
7. **Effectiveness of a telehealth service delivery model for treating attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: A community-based randomized controlled trial**
Objective To test the effectiveness of a telehealth service delivery model for the treatment of children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) that provided pharmacological treatment and caregiver **behavior** training. Method The Children's ADHD Telemental Health Treatment Study (CATTS) was a randomized controlled trial with 223 children referred by 88 primary care providers (PCPs) in 7 communities. Children randomized to the experimental telehealth service model received 6 sessions over 22 weeks of combined pharmacotherapy, delivered by **child** psychiatrists through videoconferencing, and caregiver **behavior** training, provided in person by community therapists who were supervised remotely. Children randomized to the control service delivery model received treatment with their PCPs augmented with a telepsychiatry consultation. Outcomes were diagnostic criteria for ADHD and oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) and role performance on the Vanderbilt ADHD Rating Scale (VADRS) completed by caregivers (VADRS-Caregivers) and teachers (VADRS-Teachers) and impairment on the Columbia Impairment Scale-Parent Version (CIS-P). Measures were completed at 5 assessments over 25 weeks. Results Children in both service models improved. Children assigned to the telehealth service model improved significantly more than children in the augmented primary care arm for VADRS-Caregiver criteria for inattention (2[4] = 19.47, p &lt;.001), hyperactivity (2[4] = 11.91, p =.02), combined ADHD (2[4] = 14.90, p =.005), ODD (2[4] = 10.05, p =.04), and VADRS-Caregiver role performance (2 [4] = 12.40, p =.01) and CIS-P impairment (2[4] = 20.52, p &lt;.001). For the VADRS-Teacher diagnostic criteria, children in the telehealth service model had significantly more improvement in hyperactivity (2[4] = 11.28, p =.02) and combined ADHD (2[4] = 9.72, p =.045). Conclusion The CATTS trial demonstrated the effectiveness of a telehealth service model to treat ADHD in communities with limited access to specialty mental health services.

8. **The modified checklist for autism in toddlers: A follow-up study investigating the early detection of autism spectrum disorders**
Autism **spectrum** disorders (ASD) often go undetected in toddlers. The Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT) was used to screen 3,793 children aged 16-30 months from low- and high-risk sources; screen positive cases were diagnostically evaluated. Re-screening was performed on 1,416 children aged 42-54 months. Time1 Positive Predictive Value (PPV) was .36 for the initial screening and .74 for the screening plus follow-up telephone interview; values were similar for Time2 PPV. When separating referral sources, PPV was low for the low-risk sample but acceptable with the follow-up telephone interview. Children with ASD from the low-risk and high-risk samples were highly similar. Results indicate that the M-CHAT continues to be a promising instrument for the early detection of ASD.  2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC. EID: 2-s2.0-42649127380
9. **Telemedicine and autism spectrum disorder in children and adolescents: Theoretical and practical guide [Tlmdecine et troubles du spectre de l'autisme de l'enfant et de l'adolescent: guide thorique et pratique]**
Objectives: The development of telemedicine for children and adolescents is a real need because of difficult accessibility of mental health and the paucity of childhood psychiatrists. Thus the American Academy for Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP) published in 2008 good practice recommendations for telepsychiatry in children and adolescents based on clinical consensus and scientific evidence. In France the legal framework defines four practical modalities according to the presence or not of a health professional or a psychologist with the practitioner accomplishing the teleconsultation act. Data exist about the outcome of children and adolescents who benefited from therapeutic interventions with technological media. Effect size is modest but it doesn't justify ruling out these techniques. Children who present with a developmental disorder or who cannot cooperate are evaluated with a certain degree of uncertainty. By contrast, some children with severe Attention Deficit with or without Hyperactivity (ADHD), social anxiety or Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) can be more easily engaged within a teleconsultation model. Teleconsultations in **autism** **spectrum** disorders (ASD) are feasible because of the nature of diagnosis and the type of care recommended in this disorder. The behavioral nature of the disorder and the behavioral therapeutic approaches recommended in North America culture highlight the potential interest of telemedicine because these disorders are easily observable. Literature suggests new opportunities in order to facilitate the care process for the ASD person and his family: the first one is diagnosis with use of validated instruments such as the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) and the Autism Diagnostic Interview (ADI). Parental accompaniment is the second opportunity. Development of telemedicine for ASD could be a complementary approach for diagnosis and medical care. Method: Since 2015, a program called PROMETTED (PROgramme MEdical de Tlpsychiatrie pour enfants et adolescents prsentant un Trouble Envahissant du Dveloppement) was supported by Regional Health Agency of le-de-France. It was developed and managed by the team of a Diagnosis Center Evaluation for Autism (DCEA) of Paris area in collaboration with a DCEA of le-de-France region. Five medico-social structures for children and adolescents with autistic disorders and the two diagnosis centers of evaluation for **autism** co-elaborated a scheme of intervention with telemedicine. The remote evaluation is a 4-step process: a first teleconsultation structured around the medical history of the subject in order to complete his medical file and the observation of the **young** subject; a second teleconsultation structured around the ADI-R interview with parents; the third teleconsultation is a mixed teleconsultation associating the medical expert of the DCEA and a psychologist trained in the use of the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) and the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (VABS). The fourth teleconsultation consists of the psychiatrist giving feed-back to parents about the results of the observations of the DCEA team. Results: The four-step program is well-accepted and the use of validated instruments for diagnosis or functional evaluation appears feasible. Medical data were completed for 44% of cases; complementary genetic or medical investigations were prescribed for 50% of cases; medical advice about psychotropic or vitaminic medication was given for 31% of cases. Mean duration of evaluation was 11.1 weeks  9.4. Conclusions: The PROMETTED program empirically validates the concept of remote evaluation for children and adolescents with ASD. The need to extend the use of telemedicine to tele-expertise for medicine monitoring or behavioral disorder management has been noted.  2019 Elsevier Masson SAS EID: 2-s2.0-85065535811

Purpose: Technological advances have made the delivery of psychological interventions via web-based platforms increasingly feasible. In recent years, there has been growth in the delivery of psychological interventions through web-based modalities, that is, telepsychology. Although there is evidence supporting the usability and feasibility of telepsychology for a range of populations, there is limited literature on clinician perceptions delivering telepsychology, particularly to pediatric rehabilitation populations. In this mixedmethods study, we report on clinician perspectives and experiences delivering telepsychology to children/ families impacted by pediatric traumatic brain injury. Method: Seventeen clinicians (psychologists and advanced psychology doctoral students) who delivered telepsychology interventions to children/families impacted by pediatric brain injuries completed surveys and interviews. Results: Overall, clinicians reported that telepsychology was equivalent to face-to-face treatment in many regards (e.g., therapeutic alliance, weekly progress, child/family engagement, and establishing rapport). Clinicians reported a number of advantages of telepsychology over face-to-face interventions for this pediatric population including greater ease of scheduling, increased understanding of the family and home environments, and less caregiver stigma of behavioral health care. Disadvantages of telepsychology included difficulties reading nonverbal cues, logistical/technological issues, and greater disruptions during sessions. Conclusions: Findings provide an important foundation for future investigations examining the merits of telepsychology versus traditional treatment for both pediatric rehabilitation populations.  2019 American Psychological Association.

OBJECTIVE: There are few well-evaluated uncomplicated community-based interventions for childhood aggression. The authors assess the impact of a community-based **anger** management group on **child** aggressive behaviors, using a randomized, controlled trial (RCT). METHOD: Families with children 7 to 11 years old were recruited through advertisements and randomized (N = 123). Inclusion required parent concern about anger/aggressive behavior, RCT agreement, and a telephone **behavior** screen. Intervention participants were offered three parent education/skill-building group sessions, 10 weekly **child** group sessions, and three in-home family practice sessions. Nine groups ran from August 2002 to August 2004. Interviewers nave to randomization collected data on all participants pre- and postgroup. Outcomes included child-rated **anger** and parent-rated **child** aggressive behavior, externalizing **behavior** and hostility, parent-child relationship, and parenting stress. Intent-to-treat analyses were done. RESULTS: Pre/postoutcome comparisons indicated no significant differences between intervention versus control, with small effect sizes for most outcomes (0.27-0.29). Although not significant, the magnitude of improvement favored intervention families on all parent-rated measures. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, there was no differential impact of participating in a community-based **anger** management group versus **control** on **child** aggressive behaviors and other associated measures. The impact of regression to the mean, effect, and sample size estimates; **child** comorbidity; and programmatic and methodological issues are discussed. 2006 by the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.

1. **Assessment of SUNY Upstate medical university's child telepsychiatry consultation program**
Objectives: The project assesses the **child** telepsychiatry services provided by SUNY Upstate psychiatrists to several county mental **health** clinics in central New York State. Method: Data for 45 patients was extracted from pre-consultation forms completed by the referring clinic and postconsultation summaries completed by the Upstate psychiatrists that occurred between July 13, 2009 and May 12, 2010. The study identified characteristics of patients for whom telepsychiatry consultations were sought, why they were sought, and reviewed recommended changes in therapy and medication provided by the telepsychiatry consultant. Results: Analysis of the data showed that there was a large variation in patient characteristics such as age (from age 3 to 17), current living situation, and psychological symptoms. In addition to a family history of mental illness (80%), the most common symptoms were physical aggression (60.0%), defiant/oppositional **behavior** (57.8%), and attentional problems (55.6%). The most common reason for referral was diagnostic clarification (67%). The **child** telepsychiatrist recommended a change in medication for most (80.8%) of the patients who were on medications, and to begin medications for most (63.2%) who were not receiving medication at the time of consult. Further, the telepsychiatrist often recommended the addition of family therapy (71.1%) and counseling at **school** (17.8%). Conclusion: The **child** telepsychiatric **program** at Upstate seemed effective. It reached a large variety of children with significant mental disorders. The consultants provided diagnostic clarification and recommended modification of treatment for most. However, this assessment is limited as examined as it did not include follow-up information on whether consultant recommendations were followed and, if they were, whether they were effective.  2011, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.

0. **Exploring the Telepsychiatry Experience: Primary Care Provider Perception of the Michigan Child Collaborative Care (MC3) Program**
Background: Pediatric mental healthcare is a growing component of primary care practice. However, there is a lack of access to mental health services, particularly those provided by Child and Adolescent Psychiatrists. The Michigan Child Collaborative Care (MC3) Program is a telepsychiatry service that offers embedded behavioral health consultants within primary care practices, telephonic consultation, video consultation and embedded care. Primary care provider (PCP) utilization of telepsychiatry services is predicated on perceiving the consultation service as user-friendly, helpful, and feasible in their practice. Objective: A survey of PCPs was conducted over a 5-year period to assess PCP attitudes and perceptions regarding MC3 consultation, including measures of efficiency, user-friendliness, and confidence in providing mental healthcare. The survey contained 4 items, (2 quantitative and 2 qualitative), and took less than 2 minutes to complete. Results: 649 responses were received out of 1475 possible responses (44% response rate). Common themes elicited from the qualitative items included perception of improved patient care for **youth** with mental illness (45.3%), improved comfort and confidence in caring for **youth** with mental illness (30.9%), greater comfort with the prescribing and monitoring of psychotropics (25.9%) and improved access to mental healthcare for **youth** (23.1%). PCPs strongly agreed that MC3 was user-friendly, efficient, and enhanced their confidence in managing pediatric mental health concerns. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that the MC3 Telepsychiatry Program is well accepted by PCPs with self-reported improvements in providing mental healthcare to patients. Future research should explore how PCP perception impacts PCP practice, knowledge, as well as outcomes for patients and families longitudinally.  2018 Academy of Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry EID: 2-s2.0-85051084783
1. **Evolution of telepsychiatry to rural sites: changes over time in types of referral and in primary care providers' knowledge, skills and satisfaction**
Introduction: Rural populations remain underserved in terms of psychiatric services. This study assesses changes over time in the utilization of telepsychiatric services by individual primary care providers (PCPs) and clinics in **rural** areas, specifically: (a) types of referrals for telepsychiatry service; (b) PCPs' knowledge and skills related to medication dosing; and (c) PCPs' satisfaction with telepsychiatry. Methods: Data with regard to patient demographics, diagnoses, reason for consultation, medication dosing and satisfaction were prospectively collected on the first 200 and the subsequent 200 telepsychiatric initial consultations. A number of educational interventions were implemented during the project. Results: Adult patients were primarily referred for mood and anxiety disorders, particularly for diagnosis and medication treatment planning. Over time, PCPs significantly improved medication dosing and asked for more treatment planning help. PCPs' satisfaction also improved over time. Discussion: Telepsychiatric consultation, in combination with specific educational interventions, appears to facilitate the enhancement of skills and knowledge of PCPs. "Developmental" steps in provider and clinic evolution, along with interventions specific to a given provider's and a given site's needs, ought to be further elucidated.  2006 Elsevier Inc.

2. **Lessons learned in a physician referral to pediatric telemental health services program**
Background: This study explores the physician referral and engagement process of a pediatric telemental health program based in a large urban teaching childrens hospital, and identifies the processes, strengths and challenges from the perspectives of Primary Care Physicians (PCPs) and telepsychiatrist consultants. Methods: A mixed methods approach was used. This included an online survey completed by 43 PCPs in Ontario **rural** communities who had referred patients to the telemental health program. Qualitative interviews were conducted with 11 child/adolescent telepsychiatrists who provide consultations via teleconferencing. Results: The majority of PCPs (61%) reported somewhat to moderate satisfaction with referral experiences. Challenges identified by physicians were related to communication and administration issues including: lack of timely follow-up appointments and continuity of care; lengthy referral forms; and recommendations for mental health services not accessible in their communities. Similarly, psychiatrist consultants expressed frustration with the sparse information they received from referring physicians and most significantly, the absence of appropriate service providers/professionals during the consultation to provide collateral information and ensure uptake of recommendations. Conclusion: Telemental health programs provide a valuable service to PCPs and their **child** and **youth** clients that could be significantly enhanced with a different consultation model. Such models of service delivery require protocols to educate PCPs, improve communication and information sharing and establish clear expectations between PCPs and telepsychiatry consultants.  2019, Canadian Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.

0. **Mental health services for Nunavut children and youth: Evaluating a telepsychiatry pilot project**
Introduction: This study examines the delivery of psychiatric consultation services using videoconferencing technology to **health** and **mental** **health** workers in the Nunavut territory of Canada. The research provides insights into the TeleLink Mental Health Program and the delivery of professional-to-professional program consultations and continuing education seminars. Methods: Participant observation of 12 program consultations and four continuing education sessions was conducted. Individual interviews were conducted with the consulting psychiatrist and the lead program coordinator in Nunavut. As well, a focus group was held with Nunavut workers who participated in the televideo sessions. Results: The study found a number of factors that facilitated or hindered the process and content of a consultation-based telepsychiatry program and its effect on building capacity among frontline staff. Four main themes emerged related to the delivery of psychiatric services via televideo: gaining access, ensuring culturally appropriate services, providing relevant continuing education, and offering stable and confidential technology. Conclusions: Live interactive videoconferencing technology is an innovative and effective way of delivering specialized **mental** **health** services to professionals working in remote areas of Nunavut. Study results provide important strategies for expanding this approach to other jurisdictions in Nunavut and other Inuit regions.  T Volpe, KM Boydell, A Pignatiello, 2014. EID: 2-s2.0-84904618501
1. **Weight status of children and adolescents in a telepsychiatry clinic**
The prevalence of overweight and obesity is approximately 32% among children and adolescents in the United States. Comorbid conditions associated with pediatric overweight and obesity include psychiatric conditions. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of overweight and obesity among children and adolescents presenting for consultation from **rural** communities to the UC Davis Telemedicine Program (UCDTP), as well as to collect preliminary data to design an integrated disease management program for children and adolescents with obesity and **mental** illness. Patients aged 21 and under seen for psychiatric consultation at the UCDTP between 2004 and 2006 were included. Retrospective medical record review was conducted to determine the major psychiatric diagnoses, height, weight, body-mass index, and weight status (underweight/at risk for underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese) for each patient. Of the 230 patients referred, a total of 121 patients had both height and weight values documented. Three patients were underweight; 51 were normal weight; 28 were overweight; 39 were obese. The most common psychiatric diagnoses in the 121 patients were attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; n=40), bipolar disorder (n=36), and depression (n=31). The most common psychiatric diagnoses in patients with available weight and height data who were overweight and obese were bipolar disorder (n=20), depression (n=18), and ADHD (n=17). Approximately 55% of **child** and adolescent patients seen for telepsychiatry consultation whose charts documented height and weight measurements were overweight or obese. Psychiatric diagnoses in overweight youngsters need to be researched further to determine whether the weight change is primary or secondary to mood and/or to treatments, such as medication. At such a high rate of comorbidity, monitoring the weight status of young psychiatric patients in this population is indicated.  2009, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. EID: 2-s2.0-74249085171
2. **E-CYMHS: An expansion of a child and youth telepsychiatry model in Queensland**
Objectives: The purpose of this study was to describe the evolution of the E-Child and Youth Mental Health Service (E-CYMHS), which supports regional and **rural** **mental** **health** services by providing access to consultant **child** and adolescent psychiatrists to isolated staff in regional areas, where access to specialist psychiatric services is limited. Conclusions: E-CYMHS provides a level of parity in **mental** **health** care between metropolitan, regional and remote services through the provision of regular videoconferencing services with **child** and adolescent psychiatrists and senior allied **health** clinicians. The three key features which underpin the success of the service are: 1. A central co-ordinator of services; 2. Provision of support outside regular videoconference times; and 3. Routine outreach visits that foster community capacity-building. E-CYMHS has been well received by the regional **mental** **health** services it supports, and the total provision of services has more than doubled over the last three years. It is anticipated that as telepsychiatry is increasingly viewed as a credible alternative to traditional means of **patient** care, this trend is likely to continue.  2012 The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists.

4. **Establishing a telepsychiatry consultation practice in rural Georgia for primary care physicians: A feasibility report**
Objective. One approach to solving **mental** **health** care disparity issues in **rural** areas is by establishing a telepsychiatry consultation practice for children, in which a psychiatrist sees a **child** via videoconferencing for a limited number of sessions and then provides a treatment plan to that child's primary care physician and family. Method. The present study offered a 2-session telepsychiatry consultation clinic, consisting of a psychiatric evaluation session and a recommendation session, with patients located remotely in **rural** Georgia. Results. Fifteen consultations with children aged 4 to 18 years (M = 9.73, SD = 3.39) with varying diagnoses were completed. Parental satisfaction with the telepsychiatry consultation model was high, overall mean of 4.58 (SD = 0.63) on a 5-point scale (n = 11). Conclusion. Establishing a **child** telepsychiatry consultation practice is feasible in **rural** areas. This report describes the benefits and challenges of our telepsychiatry consultation clinic with **rural** pediatric patients.  The Author(s) 2012. EID: 2-s2.0-84871769876
5. **A statewide child telepsychiatry consult system yields desired health system changes and savings**
Background: Telepsychiatry has clinical efficacy with children, but questions remain about cost-effectiveness. State agencies and **health** systems need to know if a **child** telepsychiatry consult system can address system concerns and improve care quality while lowering costs. Materials and Methods: To assist care in a **rural** state with few **child** and adolescent psychiatrists, an academic center coordinated a consult system of (1) televideo consults for high-needs children with Medicaid and state Multidisciplinary Team (MDT)/foster care involvement, (2) remote medication reviews for beyond guidelines prescribing, and (3) elective community provider telephone-based consults. Consult service data were collected and analyzed with Wyoming's Medicaid and Foster Care Divisions between the program start in January 2011 until March 2013. Results: There were 229 televideo MDT/foster care consults, 125 mandatory medication reviews, and 277 elective phone consultations supporting community providers during this period. Following implementation, the number of Medicaid children 5 years of age using psychotropic medications decreased by 42% (p<0.001), and the number of children using psychotropic doses >150% of the Food and Drug Administration maximum decreased by 52% (p<0.001). Televideo consults redirected 60% of children slated by caseworkers for a psychiatric residential treatment facility admission into alternative community treatment and placements. A financial return on investment was 1.82 to 1 for combined services. Conclusions: This coordinated **child** telepsychiatry consult system for a state Medicaid division reduced outlier pediatric psychiatric medication prescribing, supported local community-delivered treatments, and reduced unnecessary hospitalizations in a financially advantageous manner that was well received by the practice community.  2015, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

6. **Telepsychiatry assessments of child or adolescent behavior disorders: A review of evidence and issues**
Background: The limited number of **mental** **health** specialists for children has led to an increased need for **child** and adolescent psychiatrists to provide primary care consultations and treatment recommendations. Psychiatric assessments and treatments provided via two-way videoconferencing (telepsychiatry) have been used to increase the availability of **child** psychiatrists. This article reviews the literature on telepsychiatry assessment of children and adolescents. Methods: Research on telepsychiatry has focused on the comparability of telepsychiatric treatments to in-person treatment for adult patients. Relatively little research has addressed the ability of telepsychiatric assessments to facilitate favorable treatment outcomes, particularly for **child** or adolescent patients. This was a literature search using Medline via Ovid. It focused on English-language material published between 1996 and 2009. A range of search terms relating to assessment, **mental** health, telemedicine, and children was used. Any studies focusing on **child** and adolescent psychiatric assessment were included. Results: The limited literature on children is usually related to project descriptions or case reports. The studies tend to find acceptance and the diagnoses and recommendations are not seen as different from in-person assessments. Practical considerations that arise in giving telepsychiatric assessments are discussed. Conclusion: Although there are significant weaknesses in the research justifying telepsychiatric assessments in children and adolescents, there are no data that suggest that this process contributes to negative outcomes. Details on the setting for telepsychiatry assessments and camera view have not been studied.  2010, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. EID: 2-s2.0-77956140102
7. **A child and adolescent psychiatric outreach service for rural New South Wales: A telemedicine pilot study**
Objective: To examine the feasibility of a tertiary outreach service in **child** and adolescent psychiatry to two **rural** **health** centres in New South Wales, Australia. Methods: Following a site visit to Dubbo Hospital and Bourke Hospital, telemedical videoconferencing was provided for 2 h/week for 32 weeks. Details of referrers, patients' diagnosis and outcome, and satisfaction with the service were obtained. Results: Cases were triaged by a nominated **rural** adolescent **mental** **health** worker. The service provided detailed assessment and management of severe, complex, **mental** and neuropsychiatric disorders. Fifty-four young people were assessed and 72 joint consultative videoconferencing interviews were undertaken, including 26 initial consultations. Twenty-three initial consultations were undertaken on the visit to the **rural** centres. Clinical descriptions illustrate the flexibility and sensitivity of the service. Conclusion: Telepsychiatry provides access to a flexible, effective tertiary service for those with special, complex needs, including the disadvantaged or isolated. It makes a valuable, economic contribution to supporting and educating **rural** **health** professionals, thereby enriching **rural** **mental** **health** services. EID: 2-s2.0-0032702251
8. **The child and adolescent telepsychiatry consultation: Can it be a more effective clinical process for certain patients than conventional practice?**
The literature on the efficacy of telepsychiatry for assessing and treating children and adolescents with **mental** **health** problems is still developing, but there is evidence that telepsychiatry is diagnostically valid, and that there is high **patient** and provider satisfaction. Outcome studies are awaited, with the assumption that telepsychiatry has to demonstrate at least as good outcomes and reliability as face-to-face psychiatric care. In this article we suggest, by reviewing the process of telepsychiatry with children, and illustrating relevant issues with five case studies of patients we have seen, that there is a valid case for arguing that in certain children and adolescents, telepsychiatry, as a consultation process, might actually be a superior method of psychiatric assessment to face-to-face consultation. Four factors stand out supporting this view. These are the novelty of the consultation, the capacity to provide direction, the extra distance involved (both psychological and physical), and the authenticity of the interaction. More research in **child** and adolescent telepsychiatry is indicated.  2010, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. EID: 2-s2.0-77952403959
9. **Diffusion of efficacious interventions for children and adolescents with mental health problems**
Background: Child and adolescent **mental** **health** problems are prevalent and require adequate interventions. Despite several evidence-based interventions for these problems described in the literature, few studies addressed strategies to diffuse efficacious interventions for **child** **mental** disorders especially in developing countries. Methods: An extensive but not systematic review of the literature was performed aiming to identify evidence-based interventions for children and adolescents with **mental** disorders, professionals to target in disseminating these interventions, and the available strategies to diffuse information. Results: Substantial evidence-based information is available to guide preventive, psychosocial and psychopharmacological interventions. The effectiveness of treatments in real-world settings and the cost-effectiveness of interventions are rarely tested. Professionals at different levels (teachers, school counselors, social workers, general practitioners, pediatricians, **child** psychologists and psychiatrists) should be targeted in diffusing efficacious interventions for **child** **mental** **health** problems worldwide. Telepsychiatry and the internet seem to be the most promising strategies to diffuse knowledge with lower costs. Conclusions: Medical and allied professionals must incorporate **child** and adolescent **mental** **health** issues in their under- and postgraduate curricula, and be better prepared to critically evaluate available information. Professionals need to disseminate evidence-based programs to guide parents and teachers in developing countries to deal with **child** and adolescent difficulties. Countries need to explore internet solutions for dissemination of medical information.  2007 The Authors. EID: 2-s2.0-40449105030
10. **Children's experiences with chat support and telephone support**
Background: In line with the wider trend of offering support via the Internet, many counseling and referral services for children have introduced online chat, often in addition to a traditional telephone service. Methods: A comparative study was conducted between the telephone service and the confidential one-on-one online chat service of the Dutch Kindertelefoon. The design included a concise pretest and a posttest (n = 902). The study also comprised a follow-up test (n = 213), which included the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Results: Children experienced a higher sense of well-being and a reduced severity of their problems after consulting the Kindertelefoon. The results were slightly more favorable for the chat service than for the telephone service. The follow-up survey showed that many of the children who contact the Kindertelefoon suffer from relatively severe emotional problems. Conclusions: Both the telephone and the web-based support improved the children's well-being and decreased their perceived burden of problem. The results of this study underline the need for closer cooperation between **child** helplines and **mental** **health** and **child** welfare services.  2009 Association for Child and Adolescent Mental Health.

11. **A retrospective analysis of a child and adolescent eMental health program**
OBJECTIVE: New models of psychiatric intervention are needed to improve the accessibility of **mental** **health** care in the primary care setting, particularly in **rural** areas of the United States and especially for children and adolescents. The aim of this study was to examine the diagnostic characteristics and outcomes for children referred for eMental Health consultations at UC Davis (videoconferencing, telephone, and secure e-mail) from 10 primary care clinics in **rural** northern California. METHOD: A retrospective analysis was conducted on the diagnostic and clinical outcomes of 139 referred children who received a full psychiatric diagnostic evaluation via videoconferencing. Within the group, a convenience sample of 58 initial and 41 three-month follow-up Child Behavior Checklists (CBCLs) was collected. RESULTS: Comprehensive eMental Health programs appear to be effective for psychiatric diagnosis and assessment of children. Attention deficit (36.2%) and mood (28.1%) disorders were the most common diagnostic groupings overall. Most children were seen only once, but a statistically significant improvement between initial evaluation and 3-month follow-up in the convenience sample was seen in the Affect and Oppositional domains of the CBCL for girls and boys, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Versatile eMental Health programs, incorporating standardized checklists, may assist in diagnosis and treatment of **rural** children.

12. **Telepsychiatry with incarcerated youth**
Purpose: Incarcerated adolescents have a high prevalence of psychiatric disorders but lack psychiatrists to provide ongoing care. Telepsychiatry may provide one solution to treating this underserved population. Methods: Interactive video conferencing was used to connect a minimum security correctional facility with a regional telemedicine program. Clinical records were reviewed to examine utilization, demographics, diagnoses, pharmacotherapy, and **patient** satisfaction. Results: During the 29-month study period, 115 **youth** were treated using 275 telepsychiatry visits. Substance-use, behavioral, and emotional disorders were highly prevalent. Eighty percent (80%) of the **youth** were successfully prescribed medications. Youth expressed confidence with the psychiatrist's recommendations but expressed concerns about privacy. Conclusions: Telepsychiatry can successfully deliver services to incarcerated adolescents with a wide range of psychiatric needs. A patient-centered approach that directly assesses adolescents' satisfaction is recommended to ensure youths' optimal involvement in needed services.  2006 Society for Adolescent Medicine.

13. **Child and adolescent telepsychiatry: Utilization and satisfaction**
Access to psychiatric care for children and adolescents is limited outside of urban areas. Telepsychiatry provides one mechanism to bring needed services to youth. This investigation examines whether telepsychiatry could be successful in providing needed services. Using interactive video teleconferencing at 384 kilobits per second, psychiatrists based at a regional children's hospital provided consultation and management services to patients at 4 sites across Washington State located 75-150 miles from the children's hospital. Twelve-month review of billing records provided utilization data. Surveys of parents' satisfaction over 12 months examined whether parents would accept and be satisfied with the care rendered to their children. Over the study year, 387 telepsychiatry visits were provided to 172 **youth** 2-21 years old with a mean of 2.25 visits per patient. The demographic and diagnostic profile of this sample was consistent with usual outpatient **mental** **health** samples. Parents endorsed high satisfaction with their children's telepsychiatric care, with an indication of increasing satisfaction upon return appointments. Parents demonstrated some differential satisfaction, tending to higher satisfaction with their school-aged children's care and lower satisfaction with their adolescents' care. Telepsychiatry offered through a regional children's hospital was well utilized and parents were highly satisfied with their children's care. The stage is now set for integrating telepsychiatry into a system of care that meets youths' overall needs and for controlled studies demonstrating the efficacy of telepsychiatry with youth.

14. **Using technology to deliver mental health services to children and youth: A scoping review**
Objective: To conduct a scoping review on the use of technology to deliver **mental** **health** services to children and **youth** in order to identify the breadth of peer-reviewed literature, summarize findings and identify gaps. Method: A literature database search identified 126 original studies meeting criteria for review. Descriptive numerical summary and thematic analyses were conducted. Two reviewers independently extracted data. Results: Studies were characterized by diverse technologies including videoconferencing, telephone and mobile phone applications and Internet-based applications such as email, web sites and CD-ROMs. Conclusion: The use of technologies plays a major role in the delivery of **mental** **health** services and supports to children and **youth** in providing prevention, assessment, diagnosis, counseling and treatment programs. Strategies are growing exponentially on a global basis, thus it is critical to study the impact of these technologies on **child** and **youth** **mental** **health** service delivery. An in-depth review and synthesis of the quality of fndings of studies on effectiveness of the use of technologies in service delivery are also warranted. A full systematic review would provide that opportunity.  Canadian Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. EID: 2-s2.0-84900805289
15. **Practice parameter for telepsychiatry with children and adolescents**
This practice parameter discusses the use of telepsychiatry to provide services to children and adolescents. The parameter defines terms and reviews the status of telepsychiatry as a mode of **health** service delivery. Because many of the issues addressed are unique to telepsychiatry, the parameter presents principles for establishing a telepsychiatry service and optimizing clinical practice within that service. The principles presented are based on existing scientific evidence and clinical consensus. Telepsychiatry is still evolving, and this parameter represents a first approach to determining "best practices." The parameter emphasizes the integration of telepsychiatry within other practice parameters of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. 2008 by the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.

16. **Study protocol: A randomised controlled trial of a telephone delivered social wellbeing and engaged living (SWEL) psychological intervention for disengaged youth**
Background: Internationally, from 12.2-23.4% of **youth** (aged 16-24 years) are not in employment, education or training (NEET). These disengaged **youth** are more likely to experience social exclusion, increased psychological distress and poor quality of life. Youth at risk of disengagement are less likely to access traditional support services, requiring development of innovative interventions. Methods: The trial is a single blind, three arm, randomised controlled trial evaluating the effectiveness of a telephone delivered psychological intervention for disengaged **youth** (12-25 years). Participants will be randomised to receive either (i) SWEL, (ii) Befriending, or (iii) Single Session Psycho-Education. Therapy will be over an 8 week period with a minimum of four and maximum of eight sessions for the SWEL or Befriending conditions, or a single session for the Psycho-Education condition. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline and at 2, 8 and 14-month follow-up with the primary outcome being re-engagement in education, training or employment. Discussion: This large, multi-site, randomised controlled trial will inform the delivery of services for young people at risk of disengaging from education or training. The provision of psychological therapy by telephone increases access by **youth** - especially those in **rural** and remote areas - both to the trial and the treatment, if adopted by services. The outcomes of this trial could have meaningful societal impact for a vulnerable population. It is expected that recruitment, intervention and retention will present challenges for the trial given the focus on disengaged youth. Trial registration: ANZCTR, ACTRN12614001212640, Registered 18 Nov 2014. Retrospectively registered. Ethics and dissemination: Ethics approval has been obtained from the participating institutions. Results of the trial will be submitted for publication in peer reviewed journals and findings presented at scientific conferences and to key service providers and policy makers.  2019 The Author(s).

0. **Rural Status, Suicide Ideation, and Telemental Health: Risk Assessment in a Clinical Sample**
Objective: Individuals living in **rural** areas die by suicide at higher rates than those living in metropolitan areas. Telemental health interventions provide **rural** residing individuals with access to needed care. Identifying telemental health clients at **risk** for suicide is an important task for clinicians and policymakers. This study evaluated to what degree **rural** status and other demographic variables predicted suicide ideation in clients seeking services at a telemental health clinic. Methods: Study participants included 457 low-income clients residing in the medically underserved, geographically diverse Brazos Valley region of Texas. Clients completed the **patient** health questionnaire during their initial counseling appointment, which assessed depression severity and suicide ideation in the 2 weeks prior to assessment. Results: Suicide ideation was common among telemental health clients, with approximately 40% of clients in all demographic groups reporting some recent thoughts of suicide. Rates of suicide ideation did not significantly differ by geographic designation (ie, rural/metropolitan status), gender, or race/ethnicity. However, depression was a strong predictor of recent suicide ideation. Conclusions: Telemental health programs can effectively connect clinicians with **rural** residing clients who are otherwise isolated from health care services. However, clinicians working in high-need, historically underserved areas should be prepared to encounter a high prevalence of suicide ideation and depression. In these regions, clinical and diagnostic features may be better indicators of suicide ideation than demographic variables.  2018 National Rural Health Association EID: 2-s2.0-85063445623
1. **Safety of telemental healthcare delivered to clinically unsupervised settings: A systematic review**
The safety of telemental healthcare delivered to clinically unsupervised settings, such as a personal residence, must be established to inform policy and further the dissemination of telemental health programs. The aim of this article is to provide an overview of safety issues associated with telemental healthcare and, through a systematic literature review, evaluate the safety of telemental healthcare delivered to unsupervised settings. The review resulted in a total of nine studies that specifically evaluated the delivery of telemental healthcare to unsupervised settings. Six of the nine studies reviewed explicitly described safety plans or specific precautions that could be used if necessary. Two of the nine studies reported events that required the researchers to use safety procedures to effectively respond to concerns they had regarding participant safety. In both of these studies, the issues were resolved with prescribed safety procedures. Recommendations and future directions for the development and evaluation of safety protocols are discussed.  2010, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. EID: 2-s2.0-77956136277
2. **Suicide risk management during clinical telepractice**
The effective assessment and management of suicidal patients is an essential component of telehealth-based care. With this article, we describe how we have implemented procedures for the ongoing assessment and management of suicide **risk** in a clinical trial that compares in-office treatment to homebased treatment delivered via web-cam to U.S. military service members and veterans with depression. We describe our safety protocol and how it was adapted from current recommended best practices, published guidelines, and local requirements for managing **patient** safety during home-based telepractice. We conclude with discussion of other key safety issues associated with telepractice. The topics discussed are relevant to all mental health practitioners who are interested in clinical telepractice services.  2014, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc. EID: 2-s2.0-84928543508

0. **Information Technologies: An Augmentation to Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Treatment among Trauma Survivors**
This review article presents existing research describing how information technologies can be used to improve mental health services for **trauma** survivors, either by enhancing existing treatment approaches or as a stand-alone means of delivering trauma-relevant interventions. The potential ways in which technology aids in overcoming barriers to care are first addressed in terms of providing mental health treatment. The use of technologies enables shifting the locus of care from the traditional provider's office to mobile, online, and virtual environments which are less threatening for patients with post-traumatic **stress** **disorder** (PTSD), helping to overcome the core nature of the illness which includes avoidance and increased personal isolation. We then outline how different technological tools can be used for key therapeutic tasks and conclude by discussing key emergent issues that are shaping current and future use of electronic technologies as part of the continuum of care for trauma-related **disorders** such as PTSD.

1. **EPA guidance on eMental health interventions in the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)**
The aim of this EPA guidance was to develop recommendations on eMental health interventions in the treatment of **posttraumatic** **stress** **disorder** (PTSD). A systematic literature search was performed and 40 articles were retrieved and assessed with regard to study characteristics, applied technologies, therapeutic approaches, diagnostic ascertainment, efficacy, sustainability of clinical effects, practicability and acceptance, attrition rates, safety, clinician-supported vs. non-supported interventions and active vs. waiting-list controls. The reviewed studies showed a great heterogeneity concerning study type, study samples, interventions and outcome measures. Based on these findings, five graded recommendations dealing with symptom reduction, acceptability, type of administration, clinician support, self-efficacy and coping were developed.  2017 Elsevier Masson SAS EID: 2-s2.0-85013750745
2. **Risperidone for post-traumatic combat nightmares: A report of four cases**
OBJECTIVE: To report the response to low-dose risperidone in individuals with combat-related post-traumatic **stress** **disorder** (PTSD) combat nightmares. DESIGN: Case series. SETTING: Veterans Affairs Medical Center Mental Health Clinic and collaborative VA-U.S. Army Fort Bragg Warrior Transition Telepsychiatry Clinic. PRACTICE DESCRIPTION: Veterans at the VA; soldiers that have severe medical and mental health problems in the Warrior Transition Telepsychiatry Clinic. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): No response: no change in frequency and/or severity of nightmares; partial response: decrease in frequency and/or severity of nightmares; full response: total cessation of recall of nightmares. RESULTS: The four individuals included one active duty soldier and three veterans, ranging from 40 to 76 years of age. All served in the infantry, each in a different combat theater. Two participants had a reduction in the frequency and severity of nightmares at risperidone 1 mg at night. One **veteran** with blood alcohol levels greater than 300 mg/mL had a partial response with risperidone 3 mg at night. Without active substance abuse, the four individuals had a total cessation of nightmares the first night at a risperidone dose of 2 mg at night. The total cessation of nightmares with risperidone continued despite changes in concurrent antidepressants, anxiolytics, and hypnotics. No medication side effects were reported. CONCLUSION: The use of low-dose risperidone (1-3 mg) at night can reduce the severity and frequency or stop the recall of PTSD combat nightmares in some veterans and active duty soldiers. Risperidone may be an effective medication for combat nightmares of PTSD and merits additional exploration.  2011 American Society of Consultant Pharmacists, Inc. All rights reserved.

3. **PHIT for duty, a mobile approach for psychological health intervention**
The goal of this effort is to support prevention of psychological health problems through innovation in mobile personal health assessment and self-help intervention (SHI). For the U.S. military, we are developing and evaluating a fielddeployable personalized application, PHIT for Duty, to help build resilience in healthy troops and support prevention in high-risk personnel. PHIT for Duty is delivered using any smartphone or tablet with optional nonintrusive physiological and behavioral sensors for health status monitoring. The application integrates a suite of health assessments with an intelligent advisor that recommends, tailors, and presents self-help advisories. PHIT for Duty is intended for secondary prevention of psychological health problems in persons who have been exposed to psychological **trauma** and may be showing some symptoms of distress, but have not been diagnosed with any psychological disease or disorder.  2012 Interactive Media Institute.

4. **Innovative new technologies to identify and treat traumatic brain injuries: Crossover technologies and approaches between military and civilian applications**
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has become the signature injury of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom. The use of improvised explosive devices has seen an exponential increase in both Iraq and Afghanistan. In previous conflicts prior to Iraq, survivability of such an injury was far less. Today, technological improvements in **trauma** care have increased an injured warfighter's chance of survival. A reduction in severe TBI has been achieved but an increase in mild or moderate TBI has been observed. The consequences of this kind of injury can be both physical and mental and can often be hidden or even misdiagnosed. The U.S. Army is interested in pursuing technological solutions for early detection and treatment of TBI to reduce its lasting impact on the warfighter. Such technological breakthroughs have benefit beyond the military, as TBI is a high probable event in nonmilitary settings as well. To gauge what technologies or methods are currently available, the U.S. Army's Telemedicine and Advanced Technology Research Center partnered with the American Telemedicine Association to organize and conduct a discipline-specific symposium entitled "Innovative New Technologies to Identify and Treat Traumatic Brain Injuries: Crossover Technologies and Approaches Between Military and Civilian Applications." This symposium was held in Palm Springs, CA, in September 2009. The purpose of the meeting was to provide a unique opportunity for leaders from disparate organizations involved in telemedicine and related other activities to meet and explore opportunities to collaborate in new partnership models. The meeting was designed to help Telemedicine and Advanced Technology Research Center identify opportunities to expand strategic operations and form new alliances. This report summarizes this symposium while raising awareness for collaboration into better ways of adapting and adopting technologies to address this growing health issue.  2010, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

5. **Utilizing telehealth to support treatment of acute stress disorder in a theater of war: Prolonged exposure via clinical videoconferencing**
Background: Posttraumatic **stress** **disorder** (PTSD) and acute **stress** **disorder** are prevalent mental health diagnoses associated with the military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan and are especially significant in service members returning from combat. Prolonged exposure (PE) therapy is a highly effective behavioral treatment for these symptoms, and providing this treatment as soon as possible, even in the midst of a soldier's combat deployment, has strong potential benefits. Materials and Methods: In the current case study, telehealth technology was used to support the delivery of PE therapy to treat a service member diagnosed with acute **stress** **disorder** in a war zone. PE was conducted face-to-face on the relatively secure Forward Operating Base for the first half of therapy and via clinical videoconferencing (CV) to the service member's remote combat outpost during the later stages of therapy. The service member exhibited marked improvements in symptoms over 10 sessions. Results: Results are consistent with previous empirical findings and highlight the potential benefits of using telehealth to deliver evidenced-based treatment for **traumatic** **stress** **disorders** in a war zone. This case study provides a preliminary working model for delivering PE in a combat environment using multiple delivery systems. Conclusions: Benefits and clinical utility of CV-delivered exposure therapy are discussed, particularly for providers pending future operational deployments (e.g., including members of the military, independent government agencies, and first responders) and for those treating patients in remote locations.

6. **Reaching rural communities with culturally appropriate care: A model for adapting remote monitoring to American Indian veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder**
Objective: Providing specialized healthcare to rural communities can be extremely difficult, and consequently many health organizations are turning to the use of telehealth technologies for care delivery. One such technology, remote monitoring, has been successfully implemented with patients suffering from chronic and other medical conditions. A drawback, however, is that remote monitoring devices are programmed to reach a broad audience, and consequently the content may not be suitable for all patients - especially those who are not a part of the dominant culture. Subjects and Methods: This report provides a model for adapting remote monitoring to specific populations who are undergoing care for **posttraumatic** **stress** disorder. Adaptation changes focus on (1) information gathering, (2) process and dialogue changes, (3) testing, and (4) patient and administrative feedback. Data for such modifications were gathered through a series of community meetings, patient interviews, and provider feedback. A case example highlights the successful implementation of the adaptation model for a rural American Indian Veteran population. Results: Patients showed high acceptability of both the programmatic and cultural adaptations. Feasibility of the program also appeared positive, with most patients reporting that the readability of the program was appropriate, the dialogue duration was not burdensome, and technical problems were rare. Conclusions: Remote monitoring provides the ability to be modified for use with certain subpopulations. Procedural recommendations in this report highlight special considerations for working with American Indians living on or near reservation areas, although the model can be broadly adapted to several groups.

7. **Posttraumatic stress disorder treatment for operation enduring freedom/operation iraqi freedom combat veterans through a civilian community-based telemedicine network**
Background: Telemedicine holds great potential to improve access to care and to reduce barriers to treatment for military populations with **posttraumatic** **stress** **disorder** (PTSD). This study sought to integrate the use of telemedicine mental health treatment services by a community healthcare provider to military populations residing in a rural location and to compare the equivalency of **cognitive** behavioral therapy (CBT) administered via telemedicine and traditional face-to-face therapy. Subjects and Methods: Study subjects were men or women 18 years of age or older who had served in Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and/or Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and were diagnosed with PTSD. The 18 study subjects were randomized and provided 10 weekly therapy sessions of CBT. Pre- and post-intervention assessments were conducted using the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), Life Events Checklist, and SF-36v2 (QualityMetric, Lincoln, RI) Health Survey. Results: The CAPS, HAM-A, and MADRS each demonstrated lower scores, signifying improvement, and 69% of subjects experienced a clinically significant change in the CAPS. Patient satisfaction results indicated greater satisfaction for telemedicine as opposed to traditional face-to-face treatment. Conclusions: Findings reveal a trend expressing the equivalence of telemedicine and face-to-face therapy when treating OEF/OIF veterans with PTSD among rural populations by a community provider. It further demonstrates the successful collaboration between a community healthcare provider and the military healthcare system. Copyright  2014, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. EID: 2-s2.0-84900027015
8. **Relative efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy administered by videoconference for posttraumatic stress disorder: A six-month follow-up**
Until recently, only one study was published on cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) of **posttraumatic** **stress** **disorder** (PTSD) in individual therapy via videoconference (Germain, Marchand, Bouchard, Drouin, &amp; Guay, 2009); however, it only assessed the posttreatment effect. This study presents the follow-up of Germain et al.'s (2009) study. The main goal was to compare the effectiveness after six months of CBTfor PTSD either face-to-face (n = 24) or by videoconference (n = 12). Each participant received CBT for 16 to 25 weeks and completed various questionnaires before and after treatment and at a six-month follow-up. The two treatments had equivalent levels of symptom reduction (Modified PTSD Symptom Scale: 2 &lt; 0.01, p &gt;.05) and proportion of patients with a clinically significant change in symptoms (42% for face-to-face vs. 38% for videoconferencing, p &gt;.05). Thus, CBTfor PTSD via videoconference seems to be a viable alternative when adequate face-to-face treatments are less available. Copyright  Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC. EID: 2-s2.0-79956028546
9. **Telepsychology for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder: A systematic review**
The effectiveness of psychological services provided remotely, telepsychology, for the management of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) was evaluated. Eleven studies (n = 472 participants) were identified from electronic database searches. Study quality was assessed, with studies characterised by small and underpowered samples. Effect sizes and associated confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to determine the direction and magnitude of treatment change. Short-term treatment gains were reported for internet and video-based interventions. This included significant medium to large improvements (d range = 0.663.22) in **cognitive** and behavioural symptoms of depression, generalised anxiety and **posttraumatic** stress. However, the equivalence of telepsychology and face-to-face psychotherapy could not be determined, with few comparative studies available. Both treatment gains and deterioration were noted 1 to 6 months following treatment cessation, although this was based on limited follow-up data. Further larger scale and longitudinal research will help to ascertain the minimum requirements for the management and treatment of PTSD in a technology-supported environment.  2015,  The Author(s) 2015.

10. **The diffusion of telehealth in rural American Indian communities: A retrospective survey of key stakeholders**
Objective: Mental health issues are a serious concern for many American Indian Veterans, especially for post-traumatic **stress** **disorder** and related psychiatric conditions. Yet, acquiring mental health treatment can be a challenge in Native communities where specialized services are largely unavailable. Consequently, telehealth is increasingly being suggested as a way to expand healthcare access on or near reservation lands. In this study, we wanted to understand the factors affecting the diffusion of telehealth clinics that provided mental health care to rural, American Indian Veterans. Materials and Methods: We surveyed 39 key personnel and stakeholders who were involved in the decision-making process, technological infrastructure, and implementation of three clinics. Using Roger Everett's Diffusion Theory as a framework, we gathered information about specific tasks, factors hindering progress, and personal reactions to telehealth both before and after implementation. Results: Many participants expressed initial concerns about using telehealth; however, most became positive over time. Factors that influenced participants' viewpoint largely included patient and staff feedback and witnessing the fulfillment of a community health need. The use of outside information to support the implementation of the clinics and personal champions also showed considerable influence in the clinics' success. Conclusion: The findings presented here address critical gaps in our understanding of telehealth diffusion and inform research strategies regarding the cultural issues and outcomes related to telemental health services. Information contained in this report serves as a long overdue guide for developing telemental health programs and policies among American Indians, specifically, and rural populations in general.  2012 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

11. **Are Community Studies of Psychological Trauma's Impact Accurate? A Study Among Jews and Palestinians**
We evaluated the accuracy of **posttraumatic** **stress** **disorder** (PTSD) and major depression (MD) diagnoses using brief assessment instruments conducted by phone. PTSD and MD were assessed by telephone interview in a randomly selected sample of Jewish and Palestinian residents of Jerusalem (N = 150) during a period of marked threat of terrorism and war. We utilized the PTSD Symptom Scale Interview Format (Foa, Riggs, Dancu, & Rothbaum, 1993) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9; Kroenke, Spitzer, & Williams, 2001). We then conducted in-depth, in-person interviews within 2 weeks, assessing PTSD and MD using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI; Kessler et al., 2004). The prevalence of PTSD and MD diagnosis ascertained by the 2 assessment modalities was similar. Indices of classification accuracy for the phone interview, using the in-person interview as the standard, ranged from modest to high. Brief phone and in-depth in-person measures of PTSD and MD also correlated similarly with other demographic, stress, and coping factors, suggesting convergent validity. Brief phone interviews appear useful for estimating the prevalence of psychological **disorders** in mass casualty contexts and may have a critical role in both epidemiologic work and guiding public health interventions.  2011 American Psychological Association.

12. **Randomized controlled equivalence trial comparing videoconference and in person delivery of cognitive processing therapy for PTSD**
Introduction: In an effort to improve access to and utilization of health care, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) continues to investigate the effectiveness of video-teleconferencing (VTC) technologies for service delivery. While previous research focused on the efficacy of VTC treatment for post-traumatic **stress** **disorder** (PTSD) in Vietnam era veterans, few studies have evaluated the efficacy of this modality and treatment for the Iraq/Afghanistan era veterans. The aim of this randomized clinical trial was to evaluate equivalence between in person and VTC psychotherapy for PTSD in this newer cohort. Methods: Veterans of the Iraq/Afghanistan conflict from two VHA hospitals in the United States were recruited and randomized to receive **cognitive** processing therapy (CPT) for PTSD either in person (IP) or over VTC. Clinician-administered and self-report measures were collected before, during, and after treatment. Results: A trend was observed which suggested that CPT over VTC may be equivalent to the treatment delivered in person, as suggested by previous studies. Regardless of treatment, veterans who received the intervention in both conditions reported significant decreases on post-treatment measures. Discussion: This study highlighted research and clinical challenges in providing services to the newest **veteran** generation in general as well as unique challenges with VTC. One complicating factor to the statistical power of this study was a treatment dropout rate twice the original estimate. Factors that could have influenced this high dropout rate are explored.  2015,  The Author(s) 2015. EID: 2-s2.0-84971468403
13. **Soldiers' personal technologies on deployment and at home**
Objective: Personal technologies such as smartphones, computers, and gaming devices, are ubiquitous in the civilian world. Consequently they represent ideal vehicles for disseminating psychological and other health resources and interventions. However, almost nothing is known about personal technology use in the U.S. military. We conducted the most comprehensive survey to date of the use, availability, and need for personal technologies by U.S. military service members. Our survey asked detailed questions about computers and the Internet, phones and smartphones, other mobile or portable technologies, gaming devices, and TV and video media used during deployment and at permanent duty station or home. Materials and Methods: We collected data by paper-and-pencil survey in 2010 and 2011 from 331 active Army service members at a processing and registration center in a large military installation in the western United States. Two cohorts were surveyed: Soldiers who had previously been deployed to a warzone and soldiers who had never been deployed. Results and Conclusion: We measured high rates of personal technology use by service members at home across all popular electronic media. Soldiers at home essentially resembled civilian consumers in their use of popular technologies. Some technologies, including the Internet, gaming, and TV, were widespread on deployment. Others, most notably cellphones, were more restricted by availability, connectivity, opportunity, and military regulation in the warzone. Results will enable researchers and technology developers target their efforts on the most promising and popular technologies for psychological health in the military.

14. **Pilot Assessment and Survey of Syrian Refugees' Psychological Stress and Openness to Referral for Telepsychiatry (PASSPORT Study)**
Background: Given the scarcity of mental health resources available for refugees in areas of conflict, it is imperative to investigate interventions that would be accepted by the refugees. Materials and Methods: In this study we surveyed 354 Syrian refugees using the HADStress screening tool and asked about their openness to referral to psychiatry and telepsychiatry. Results: Of the surveyed sample, 41.8% had scores on HADStress that correlate to **posttraumatic** **stress** disorder. However, only 34% of the whole sample reported a perceived need to see a psychiatrist, and of those only 45% were open to telepsychiatry. Conclusions: Women, those who were bilingual, and those with positive HADStress status were less likely to accept telepsychiatry; however, this finding did not reach statistical significance. This study reports a partial acceptance of Syrian refugees for telepsychiatric services despite the high prevalence of psychological stress.  Copyright 2014, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2014.

15. **Telemedicine: A cost-reducing means of delivering psychotherapy to rural combat veterans with PTSD**
Background: Although effective psychotherapies for **posttraumatic** **stress** **disorder** (PTSD) exist, high percentages of Veterans in need of services are unable to access them. One particular challenge to providing cost-effective psychological treatments to Veterans with PTSD involves the difficulty and high cost of delivering in-person, specialized psychotherapy to Veterans residing in geographically remote locations. The delivery of these services via clinical videoteleconferencing (CVT) has been presented as a potential solution to this access to care problem. Materials and Methods: This study is a retrospective cost analysis of a randomized **controlled** trial investigating telemedicine service delivery of an anger management therapy for Veterans with PTSD. The parent trial found that the CVT condition provided clinical results that were comparable to the in-person condition. Several cost outcomes were calculated in **order** to investigate the clinical and cost outcomes associated with the CVT delivery modality relative to in-person delivery. Results: The CVT condition was significantly associated with lower total costs compared with the in-person delivery condition. The delivery of mental health services via CVT enables Veterans who would not normally receive these services access to empirically based treatments. Additional studies addressing long-term healthcare system costs, indirect cost factors at the patient and societal levels, and the use of CVT in other geographic regions of the United States are needed. Conclusions: The results of this study provide evidence that CVT is a cost-reducing mode of service delivery to Veterans with PTSD relative to in-person delivery.

16. **BEHAVIORAL ACTIVATION and THERAPEUTIC EXPOSURE for POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER: A NONINFERIORITY TRIAL of TREATMENT DELIVERED in PERSON VERSUS HOME-BASED TELEHEALTH**
Objective Combat veterans returning to society with impairing mental health conditions such as PTSD and major depression (MD) report significant barriers to care related to aspects of traditional psychotherapy service delivery (e.g., stigma, travel time, and cost). Hence, alternate treatment delivery methods are needed. Home-based telehealth (HBT) is one such option; however, this delivery mode has not been compared to in person, clinic-based care for PTSD in adequately powered trials. The present study was designed to compare relative noninferiority of evidence-based psychotherapies for PTSD and MD, specifically Behavioral Activation and Therapeutic Exposure (BA-TE), when delivered via HBT versus in person, in clinic delivery. Method A repeated measures (i.e., baseline, posttreatment, 3-, 6-month follow-up) randomized **controlled** design powered for noninferiority analyses was used to compare PTSD and MD symptom improvement in response to BA-TE delivered via HBT versus in person, in clinic conditions. Participants were 232 veterans diagnosed with full criteria or predefined subthreshold PTSD. Results PTSD and MD symptom improvement following BA-TE delivered by HBT was comparable to that of BA-TE delivered in person at posttreatment and at 3- and 12-month follow-up. Conclusion Evidence-based psychotherapy for PTSD and depression can be safely and effectively delivered via HBT with clinical outcomes paralleling those of clinic-based care delivered in person. HBT, thereby, addresses barriers to care related to both logistics and stigma.  2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. EID: 2-s2.0-84964643214
17. **Therapist adherence and competence with manualized cognitive-behavioral therapy for PTSD delivered via videoconferencing technology**
Using secondary analyses from a randomized trial comparing the effectiveness of manualized cognitive-behavioral therapy for **posttraumatic** **stress** disorder, we compared ratings of therapist competency and adherence between two service delivery modes: telepsychiatry (TP) and same room (SR). Patients were 38 male treatment-seeking veterans recruited from a veterans affairs medical center. Domains of therapist competence and adherence included structuring sessions, implementing session activities, providing feedback, dealing with difficulties, developing rapport, and conveying empathy. Only one difference emerged between the two treatment conditions, with more favorable ratings on this item in the TP condition. Findings suggest that therapist competence and adherence to cognitive-behavioral therapy is similar whether the treatment is delivered via TP or by traditional means, and TP does not compromise therapists' ability to effectively structure sessions or build rapport with patients. These data further support the use of TP to address shortages in access to mental health care.  2007 Sage Publications. EID: 2-s2.0-34848840294
18. **Effectiveness of cognitive behavioural therapy administered by videoconference for posttraumatic stress disorder**
Telehealth, or health care via videoconferencing, constitutes a clinical option that makes it possible to treat patients remotely. A growing number of studies have demonstrated that telehealth is a feasible and effective method for diagnostic interviews and psychiatric consultations. However, few studies have assessed the effectiveness of psychotherapy given by videoconference. This study examines the effectiveness of **cognitive** behavioural therapy (CBT) administered by videoconference for **posttraumatic** **stress** **disorder** (PTSD). Forty-eight participants with PTSD were recruited for the study: 16 in the videoconferencing condition and 32 in a **control** face-to-face condition. Each participant received CBT for 16 to 25 weeks and completed various questionnaires before and after treatment. The results show a significant decline in the frequency and severity of **posttraumatic** symptoms after treatment in both conditions. A clinical improvement in overall functioning was also observed. No significant difference was observed in the effectiveness of the two therapeutic conditions. The examination of effect sizes supports these results. A number of clinical implications and certain avenues for future research are discussed. EID: 2-s2.0-61549135353
19. **Telepsychiatry- based care for the treatment follow-up of iranian war veterans with post- traumatic stress disorder: A randomized controlled trial**
Background: Physical limitations, distance, and time are major obstacles to access to mental health services for veterans and soldiers. This study was aimed at comparing the efficacy of telepsychiatry and face-to-face consultation as methods of treating post-traumatic **stress** **disorder** (PTSD). The comparison was based on treatment costs, access to health services, completion of therapy sessions, and patient satisfaction as variables. Methods: This research was a double blinded clinical trial supported by Tabriz University of Medical Sciences and conducted in 2015 to 2016 in Tabriz, Iran. Totally, 60 patients were included in the study. Through simple randomization, the patients were divided into experimental and **control** groups, both of whom were treated through face-to-face consultations for the first 3 sessions. Six follow-up sessions were then held remotely with the experimental group and face to face with the **control** group. Data were collected using a self-designed and reliable questionnaire and entered in SPSS, version 16. Intergroup comparisons were performed using descriptive statistical measures. Finally, the results were tested using the t test method. Results: A significant relationship was found between the use of information technology and increased patient satisfaction, completion of therapy sessions, and reduction in treatment costs; however, no significant difference was found between the groups in terms of reduction in waiting time and access to a psychiatrist. Conclusion: Telepsychiatry is an effective means of delivering mental health services to psychiatric outpatients living in remote areas with limited resources. The results provide preliminary support for the use of telepsychiatry in treating PTSD and improving access to care.  2019, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences. All rights reserved.

20. **Early treatment withdrawal from evidence-based psychotherapy for PTSD: Telemedicine and in-person parameters**
Objective: To determine differences in reported barriers to treatment completion associated with telemedicine vs. in-person delivery of evidence-based treatment for PTSD in combat veterans. Method: The present study was derived from two ongoing randomized **controlled** trials (RCTs) comparing in-person vs. telemedicine delivery of exposure therapy for PTSD. A onetime telephone assessment of participants who dropped out from the treatment phase of these two studies was conducted, with measures focusing on reported reasons for dropout, and perceived comfort and efficacy of the treatment modality. Dichotomous data were analyzed via chi-square and logistic regression; continuous data via ANOVA. Results: Forty-seven of 69 total dropouts participated. There was no difference in rate of dropout between modalities. A greater proportion of participants receiving in-person exposure therapy reported difficulties with logistical aspects of care (e.g., parking), whereas a greater proportion of participants receiving telemedicine therapy reported difficulty tolerating certain stressful aspects of treatment; however, those receiving telemedicine delivered treatment completed more sessions before dropping out. Participants in both conditions reported that they liked and were confident in their therapist Conclusions: Dropout reasons varied according to type of treatment delivery. Recommendations for future research are given in terms of modification of treatment protocol according to delivery modality.  2014, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc. EID: 2-s2.0-84988260168

0. **Developing Telemental Health Partnerships Between State Medical Schools and Federally Qualified Health Centers: Navigating the Regulatory Landscape and Policy Recommendations**
Background: Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) deliver care to 26 million Americans living in underserved areas, but few offer telemental **health** (TMH) services. The social missions of FQHCs and publicly funded state medical schools create a compelling argument for the development of TMH partnerships. In this paper, we share our experience and recommendations from launching TMH partnerships between 12 **rural** FQHCs and 3 state medical schools. Experience: There was consensus that medical school TMH providers should practice as part of the FQHC team to promote integration, enhance quality and safety, and ensure financial sustainability. For TMH providers to practice and bill as FQHC providers, the following issues must be addressed: (1) credentialing and privileging the TMH providers at the FQHC, (2) expanding FQHC Scope of Project to include telepsychiatry, (3) remote access to medical records, (4) insurance credentialing/paneling, billing, and supplemental payments, (5) contracting with the medical school, and (6) indemnity coverage for TMH. Recommendations: We make recommendations to both state medical schools and FQHCs about how to overcome existing barriers to TMH partnerships. We also make recommendations about changes to policy that would mitigate the impact of these barriers. Specifically, we make recommendations to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid about insurance credentialing, facility fees, eligibility of TMH encounters for supplemental payments, and Medicare eligibility rules for TMH billing by FQHCs. We also make recommendations to the Health Resources and Services Administration about restrictions on adding telepsychiatry to the FQHCs Scope of Project and the eligibility of TMH providers for indemnity coverage under the Federal Tort Claims Act.  2018 The Authors.

1. **Attitudes Towards Implementation of Store-and-Forward Telemental Health in Humanitarian Settings: Survey of Syrian Healthcare Providers**
Store-and-forward (SandF) telemedicine is thought to be most applicable in humanitarian settings. Unlike other kinds of telemental **health** (TMH), SandF requires engagement and active participation from healthcare providers in submitting text or audio-video clinical material for consultations. To implement such consultative systems there is a need to gauge providers' attitudes towards this technology. Materials and Methods: An electronic survey was sent to Syrian healthcare providers (physicians and nonphysicians) who are affiliated with humanitarian nongovernmental organizations managing Syrians affected by war. After a description of what TMH and SandF are, participants were asked about their attitudes towards such services. Results: Fifty-two providers responded to the electronic survey. Only results from providers inside Syria (n=30) are presented. The majority of respondents had no experience with TMH. Half of the providers believed that **mental** healthcare can be provided through SandF and that there would be a benefit from such services. Respondents reported that cultural (68%), financial (84%), and technical (80%) barriers do exist for such services. When asked, providers believed that patients would agree to be audiotaped (58%) for the purpose of SandF compared with being videotaped (15%) (p=0.007). Conclusions: Electronic surveys of healthcare workers in humanitarian settings are feasible. Providers in the Syrian humanitarian setting have little experience in TMH; however, they are open to using an SandF service while acknowledging cultural, financial, and technical barriers to the implementation.  2016 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

2. **A pilot project to improve access to Telepsychotherapy at rural clinics**
Background: The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has pioneered telemental **health** (TMH) with over 500,000 TMH encounters over the past decade. VA community-based outpatient clinics were established to improve accessibility of **mental** healthcare for **rural** Veterans. Despite these clinics clinics and increased availability of TMH, many **rural** Veterans have difficulty receiving **mental** healthcare, particularly psychotherapy. Materials and Methods: Twelve therapists participated in a pilot **project** using TMH technologies to improve **mental** healthcare service delivery to **rural** Veterans treated at six community clinics. Therapists completed online training, and study staff communicated with them monthly and clinical leaders every other month. Therapists completed two questionnaires: before training and 10 months later. This article describes barriers and facilitators to the implementation of the project, as well as therapists' knowledge, confidence, and motivation regarding TMH. Results: Two clinicians were offering telepsychotherapy after 10 months. At all six sites, unanticipated organizational constraints and administrative barriers delayed implementation; establishing organizational practices and therapists' motivation helped facilitate the process. Adopters of the **project** reported more positive views of the modality and did not worry about staffing, a concern of nonadopters. Conclusions: Despite barriers to implementation, lessons learned from this pilot **project** have led to improvements and changes in TMH processes. Results from the pilot showed that therapists providing telepsychotherapy had increased confidence, knowledge, and motivation. As TMH continues to expand, formalized decision-making with clinical leaders regarding **project** goals, better matching of therapists with this modality, and assessment of medical center and clinic readiness are recommended.  2014, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

3. **Telemental health: Responding to mandates for reform in primary healthcare**
Telemental **health** (TMH) has established a niche as a feasible, acceptable, and effective service model to improve the **mental** healthcare and outcomes for individuals who cannot access traditional **mental** **health** services. The Accountability Care Act has mandated reforms in the structure, functioning, and financing of primary care that provide an opportunity for TMH to move into the mainstream healthcare system. By partnering with the Integrated Behavioral Healthcare Model, TMH offers a spectrum of tools to unite primary care physicians and **mental** **health** specialist in a mind-body view of patients' healthcare needs and to activate patients in their own care. TMH tools include video-teleconferencing to telecommute **mental** **health** specialists to the primary care setting to collaborate with a team in caring for patients' **mental** healthcare needs and to provide direct services to patients who are not progressing optimally with this collaborative model. Asynchronous tools include online therapies that offer an efficient first step to treatment for selected disorders such as depression and anxiety. Patients activate themselves in their care through portals that provide access to their healthcare information and Web sites that offer on-demand information and communication with a healthcare team. These synchronous and asynchronous TMH tools may move the site of **mental** healthcare from the clinic to the home. The evolving role of social media in facilitating communication among patients or with their healthcare team deserves further consideration as a tool to activate patients and provide more personalized care.  2013, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

4. **Provider barriers to telemental health: Obstacles overcome, obstacles remaining**
Many providers are hesitant to use telemental **health** technologies. When providers are queried, various barriers are presented, such as the clinician's skepticism about the effectiveness of telemental **health** (TMH), viewing telehealth technologies as inconvenient, or reporting difficulties with medical reimbursement. Provider support for TMH is critical to its diffusion because clinicians often serve as the initial gatekeepers to telehealth implementation and program success. In this article, we address provider concerns in three broad domains: (1) personal barriers, (2) clinical workflow and technology barriers, and (3) licensure, credentialing, and reimbursement barriers. We found evidence that, although many barriers have been discussed in the literature for years, advancements in TMH have rapidly reduced obstacles for its use. Improvements include extensive opportunities for training, a growing evidence base supporting positive TMH outcomes, and transformations in technologies that improve provider convenience and transmission quality. Recommendations for further change are discussed within each domain. In particular, it is important to grow and disseminate data underscoring the promise and effectiveness of TMH, integrate videoconferencing capabilities into electronic medical record platforms, expand TMH reimbursement, and modify licensure standards.  2013, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

0. **A Virtual RealityBased Psychological Treatment in Long-Term Hospitalization: A Case Study**
The aim of this article is to provide preliminary efficacy of a psychological intervention for children and young patients to help them to improve resilience, coping strategies for pain, anxiety, and general emotional discomfort in long-term hospitalization using a **virtual** reality videogame and telepsychology. A case study illustration in an adolescent was 15-year-old Spanish boy hospitalized in the pediatric ward and prescribed dialysis is presented to provide some clinical evidence of the treatments strategic feasibility and efficacy for this population. Patient was pre, post, and follow-up assessed anxiety, affective, resilience, and avoidance. Space Academy is a **virtual** realitybased treatment with positive psychology and third-wave therapy components that consist in understanding the basic aspects of their disease, to promote emotional perception and regulation and promote and develop resilience. Results show good acceptability and feasibility, improved state and trait anxiety, resilience, and emotional competence in controlling behavior. The case illustration shows improvements in anxiety resilience and acceptance. The use of information and communication technologies in psychology is an advance in clinical and health care psychology.  The Author(s) 2018. EID: 2-s2.0-85058637781
1. **A pilot randomized controlled trial of videoconference-assisted treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder**
Evidence-based exposure and response prevention (ERP) treatment for **obsessive-compulsive** disorder (OCD) is not always easily accessible. Long distances from specialist treatment and other practical or motivational difficulties can interfere with ERP access and outcome. Delivery of ERP through telepsychology can help "fill the gap". The current study included 30 patients with OCD who were randomized to 12 weeks of either videoconference-assisted ERP (VCT; N=10), self-help ERP (S-H, N=10), or a wait-list condition (W-L, N=10). The VCT format included use of tablet-based videoconferencing sessions (N=6) or studio-based videoconference (N=4), as well as telephone calls. Patients rated the VCT format as natural and reported strong working alliances with their therapists. VCT treatment produced significantly greater reductions in **obsessive-compulsive** symptoms compared to the two control conditions. Treatment outcomes were similar to that of regular face-to-face ERP and improvements in symptom scores remained stable at follow-up. The study indicated that ERP for OCD can be delivered efficiently with videoconferencing technology along with telephone calls. The use of such technology in psychological treatment is likely to become more common in the future and it holds promise as a method to make evidence-based treatment more accessible.  2014 Elsevier Ltd.

2. **An open trial of videoconference-mediated exposure and ritual prevention for obsessive-compulsive disorder**
The gold-standard treatment for OCD is exposure and ritual prevention (ERP), yet despite its well-established efficacy, only a small percentage of OCD patients have access to this treatment. Remote treatments (e.g., videoconferencing) are becoming increasingly popular avenues for treatment delivery and show promise in increasing patient access to evidence-based mental health care. The current pilot study utilized an open trial to examine the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of videoconference-mediated, twice weekly, ERP for adults (n= 15) with OCD. Results revealed that ERP was associated with significant improvements in OCD symptoms and large within-group effect sizes. Among the 10 individuals who completed a 3-month follow-up assessment, 30% of participants no longer met DSM-IV-TR criteria for OCD and 80% of participants were rated as very much or much improved on the CGI. This study adds to the growing body of literature suggesting that videoconference-based interventions are viable alternatives to face-to-face treatment.  2014 Elsevier Ltd. EID: 2-s2.0-84901432153
3. **Telemental health: A status update**
A rather large body of literature now exists on the use of telemental health services in the diagnosis and management of various psychiatric conditions. This review aims to provide an up-to-date assessment of telemental health, focusing on four main areas: computerized CBT (cCBT), Internet-based CBT (iCBT), **virtual** reality exposure therapy (VRET), and mobile therapy (mTherapy). Four scientific databases were searched and, where possible, larger, better-designed meta-analyses and controlled trials were highlighted. Taken together, published studies support an expanded role for telepsychiatry tools, with advantages that include increased care access, enhanced efficiency, reduced stigma associated with visiting mental health clinics, and the ability to bypass diagnosis-specific obstacles to treatment, such as when social anxiety prevents a patient from leaving the house. Of technology-mediated therapies, cCBT and iCBT possess the most efficacy evidence, with VRET and mTherapy representing promising but less researched options that have grown in parallel with **virtual** reality and mobile technology advances. Nonetheless, telepsychiatry remains challenging because of the need for specific computer skills, the difficulty in providing patients with a deep understanding or support, concerns about the "therapeutic alliance", privacy fears, and the well documented problem of patient attrition. Future studies should further test the efficacy, advantages and limitations of technology-enabled CBT, as well as explore the online delivery of other psychotherapeutic and psychopharmacological modalities.  2015 World Psychiatric Association.

0. **Alcohol abuse management in primary care: An e-learning course**
Background: The mental health knowledge gap challenges public health. The Alcohol Abuse Management in Primary Care (AAMPC) is an e-learning course designed to cover alcohol-related problems from the primary care perspective. The goal of this study was to verify if the AAMPC was able to enhance healthcare professionals' alcohol-related problems knowledge. Materials and Methods: One hundred subscriptions for the AAMPC were offered through the federal telehealth program. The course was instructor-led and had nine weekly classes, delivered synchronously or asynchronously, at the students' convenience, using a varied array of learning tools. At the beginning, students took a test that provided a positive score, related to critical knowledge for clinical management, and a negative score, related to misconceptions about alcohol-related problems. The test was repeated 2 months after course completion. Results: Thirty-three students completed the course. The positive score improved significantly (p<0.001), but not the negative score. Students with previous experience with e-courses presented greater improvement on the positive score (p<0.036). Eighty-percent of the students thought the course excelled in meeting its objectives. Web conferences and video and audio recordings were the most appreciated learning tools. Course satisfaction was negatively related to frequency of Internet access (Spearman's rho=-0.455, p=0.022). Conclusions: E-learning was highly appreciated as a learning tool, especially by students with the least frequency of Internet use. Nonetheless, it worked better for those previously familiar with e-courses. The AAMPC e-course provided effective knowledge transmission and retention. Complementary strategies to reduce misconceptions about alcohol-related problems must be developed for the training of primary care staff.  Copyright 2015, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2015.

1. **Telepsychiatry and carer education for schizophrenia**
Objective: Despite the scientific evidence, most families of people with **schizophrenia** in Europe never receive a carer education programme. We evaluated whether a carer education course delivered by telepsychiatry was as effective as a carer education course delivered in situ. Method: We delivered the carer education course for **schizophrenia** simultaneously to a carers group in rural north west Ireland (remote) via three ISDN lines and live to a carers group in a city (host). We compared knowledge gains using the Knowledge Questionnaire before and after each course. Results: Fifty-six carers of people with **schizophrenia** participated in the trial. At baseline, participants at the remote and host centers did not differ in terms of knowledge about schizophrenia. After the course, carers at both centers improved significantly and the knowledge gains between groups were equivalent at 6. weeks. Conclusion: Telepsychiatry can deliver effective carer education programmes about **schizophrenia** and may provide one solution to bridging the chasm between scientific evidence and clinical reality.  2010 Elsevier Masson SAS.

2. **Travel distance and the use of inpatient care among patients with schizophrenia**
This study examines the variations in the use of inpatient care that can be explained by travel distance among patients with **schizophrenia** living in Taiwan. Data were drawn from the Psychiatric Inpatient Medical Claims Database. We used mediation analysis and multilevel analysis to identify associations. Travel distance did not significantly account for lower readmission rates after an index admission, but significantly explained the longer length of stay of an index admission by 9.3 days (P < 0.001, 85% of variation) between remote and non-remote regions. Policies are discussed aimed at reducing the impact of travel distance on rural mental health care through inter-disciplinary collaboration and telepsychiatry.  2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

3. **What is the potential for social networks and support to enhance future telehealth interventions for people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia: A critical interpretive synthesis**
Background: Digital technologies are increasingly directed at improved monitoring, management and treatment of mental health. However, their potential contribution to **social** networks and self-management **support** for people diagnosed with a serious mental illness has rarely been considered. This review and meta-synthesis aimed to examine the processes of engagement and perceived relevance and appropriateness of telehealth interventions for people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia. The review addresses three key questions. How is the use of digital communications technologies framed in the professional psychiatric literature? How might the recognised benefits of telehealth translate to people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia? What is the user perspective concerning Internet information and communication technologies?Methods: A critical interpretive synthesis (CIS) of published findings from quantitative and qualitative studies of telehealth interventions for people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia. Results: Most studies were of an exploratory nature. The professional discourse about the use of different technologies was overlain by concerns with surveillance and control, focusing on the Internet as a potential site of risk and danger. The critical synthesis of findings showed that the key focus of the available studies was on the delivery of existing traditional approaches (e.g. improving medications adherence, provision of medical information about the condition, symptom monitoring and cognitive behavioural therapy). Even though it was clear that the Internet has considerable potential in terms of accessing and utilising lay support, the potential of communication technologies in mobilising of resources for personal self-management or peer **support** was a relatively absent or hidden a focus of the available studies. Conclusions: Based on an interpretive synthesis of available studies, people with a diagnosis of **schizophrenia** or psychosis use the Internet primarily for the purposes of disclosure and information gathering. Empowerment, regulation and surveillance emerged as the key dimensions of engagement (or not) with telehealth interventions. The findings suggest that telehealth interventions are disproportionately used by particular patient groups (e.g.women, people who are employed). Further research needs to ascertain the mechanisms by which telehealth interventions may be potentially beneficial or harmful for engagement and management to people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia.  2013 Daker-White and Rogers; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

4. **Developing Texting for Relapse Prevention: A Scalable mHealth Program for People with Schizophrenia and Schizoaffective Disorder**
Symptom relapse in people with **schizophrenia** and schizoaffective disorder is common and has a negative impact on the course of illness. Here, we describe the development of Texting for Relapse Prevention, a scalable, cost-effective text messaging relapse prevention program that queries patients' "early warning signs" daily. Results of development focus groups and content advisory teams with 25 patients and 19 providers suggest that patients were enthusiastic about the program and thought that receiving daily messages about their symptoms would help them feel supported. Providers also were positive about the idea but worried that the program might interfere with patient-provider communication if patients thought that the messages were coming from providers. Patients found the content positive and actionable. The program was improved to address this feedback. This iterative development process that included multiple stakeholders ensured that the program is feasible and acceptable to both patients and providers.  Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

This study investigates the feasibility and effectiveness of providing telepsychiatry services to Chinese immigrants in a **nursing** home. The psychiatrist interviewed patients face-to-face for the initial consultation, and encouraged them to participate in this study to receive telepsychiatry-based follow-up visits. The feasibility and outcomes of telepsychiatry visits and satisfaction of the subjects, their families, and the **nursing** **home** **staff** were assessed. Nine monolingual Chinese immigrants, 8 women and 1 man, ranging from 54 to 88 years of age, were enrolled. The main reasons for psychiatric consultation were mood and behavioral problems. Eight of the 9 (88.9%) subjects participated in videoconference follow-up visits, and 1 subject (11.1%) declined. Among the 8 subjects, 6 were referred for psychiatric intervention, 1 for differential diagnosis, and 1 for suicide assessment. At the end of the study, all 6 subjects referred for intervention had greatly improved; the subjects, their families, and the **nursing** **staff** were highly satisfied with the telepsychiatry service. It is feasible to provide psychiatry consultations to ethnic immigrants in a **nursing** **home** despite the fact that many of them are unfamiliar with the technology and suffer from dementia and psychotic symptoms. Telepsychiatry provides an efficient way for ethnic elders in **nursing** homes to connect with mental health professionals with the appropriate language and cultural background, regardless of location. Telepsychiatry may decrease the disparities in treatment of mental illnesses among ethnic immigrants in **nursing** homes.  2009, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. EID: 2-s2.0-66149190915
1. **Telepsychiatry in psychogeriatric service: A pilot study**
A pilot study on telepsychiatry was conducted in which a videoconferencing link was established between a regional hospital and a care and attention home. Using this system, a psychogeriatric outreach team provided 149 psychiatric assessments to 45 residents of the care and attention **home** over 11 months. Videoconferencing was found to be highly feasible. It was acceptable to **staff** and patients and more cost-effective than on-site visits. Copyright  2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

2. **Benefits of a telepsychiatry consultation service for rural nursing home residents**
Psychiatric care for **nursing** **home** residents is difficult to obtain, especially in rural areas, and this deficiency may lead to significant morbidity or death. Providing this service by videoconference may be a helpful, cost-effective, and acceptable alternative to face-to-face treatment. We analyzed data for 278 telepsychiatry encounters for 106 **nursing** **home** residents to estimate potential **cost** and time savings associated with this modality compared to in-person care. A total of 843.5 hours (105.4 8-hour work days) of travel time was saved compared to in-person consultation for each of the 278 encounters if they had occurred separately. If four resident visits were possible for each trip, the time saved would decrease to 26.4 workdays. Travel distance saved was 43,000 miles; 10,750 miles if four visits per trip occurred. More than $3,700 would be spent on gasoline for 278 separate encounters; decreased to $925 for four visits per roundtrip. Personnel **cost** savings estimates ranged from $33,739 to $67,477. Physician costs associated with additional travel time ranged from $84,347 to $253,040 for 278 encounters, or from $21,087 to $63,260 for four encounters per visit. The telepsychiatry approach was enthusiastically accepted by virtually all residents, family members, and **nursing** **home** personnel, and led to successful patient management. Providing psychiatric care to rural **nursing** **home** residents by videoconference is **cost** effective and appears to be a medically acceptable alternative to face-to-face care. In addition, this approach will allow many **nursing** homes to provide essential care that would not otherwise be available.  2010 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. EID: 2-s2.0-76349109253

0. **An internet-based cognitive-behavioral preventive intervention for complicated grief: A pilot study**
Bereaved parents and individuals bereaved by the sudden, unexpected, or violent death of a loved one are at high risk for developing complicated grief. However, preventive interventions for this at-risk population remain scarce. In the present pilot study, an Internet-based intervention for individuals bereaved in the previous 14 months was tested using a pretest/posttest design. A total of 35 bereaved individuals participated in a 3-week manualized prevention program. Counselor and participants communicated exclusively via email. The intervention consisted of the following modules: (1) describing the circumstances of the death, (2) using the life-imprint method to explore the biography and life imprint of the deceased, (3) keeping a daily diary of social activities and sleep hygiene, (4) cognitive restructuring of dysfunctional thoughts, such as responsibility for the death and feelings of guilt, (5) communication within the family, (6) gender-specific coping with bereavement, and (7) bond with the deceased. Completer and intent-to-treat analyses suggest that the intervention led to a significant reduction in symptoms of complicated **grief** and depression at posttreatment.  PI-ME, 2008.

1. **Adolescent and parent experiences with a primary care/Internet-based depression prevention intervention (CATCH-IT)**
This article describes a mixed-methods approach to understand the experience of adolescents involved in the Internet-based intervention for depression, Competent Adulthood Transition with Cognitive Behavioral Humanistic and Interpersonal Training (CATCH-IT), as well as the experiences of their parents while they were involved. Qualitative analysis was done with grounded theory-based categorization of interview comments and typed program responses (adolescents only) into themes. Quantitative analysis was done with self-report surveys. The article describes the nine themes reflecting the adolescent experience and the three themes reflecting the parent experience. The article also describes the results of the quantitative surveys of helpfulness and attitudes change, which were favorable of the Internet-based intervention. Separate models explaining the psychological transformation of the adolescents and the experience of the parents are proposed. The positive experience of the adolescents and parents involved in CATCH-IT is discussed in the **context** of growing interest in how best to utilize Internet-based interventions for **mental** illness, and suggestions are made for future investigation.  2011 Elsevier Inc.

2. **Internet-Based Interventions for the Prevention and Treatment of Mental Disorders in Latin America: A Scoping Review**
Background: There is a huge gap in the treatment of **mental** disorders in Latin America, especially among socioeconomically disadvantaged groups. Given the sharp increase in Internet access and the rapid penetration of smartphones in the region, the use of Internet-based technologies might potentially contribute to overcoming this gap and to provide more widely distributed and low-cost **mental** health care in a variety of contexts. Methods: We conducted a scoping review of the literature in order to systematically map the existing evidence on use of Internet-based interventions for prevention, treatment, and management of **mental** disorders across Latin American countries, as well as to identify existing gaps in knowledge. Six electronic databases were searched for published papers (PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, SciELO, and CENTRAL). Results: After the eligibility assessment, we identified 22 Internet-based studies carried out in Latin America for prevention, treatment, education, or facilitating self-management of **mental** disorders. Included studies mainly targeted depression (n = 11), substance misuse (n = 6), anxiety (n = 3), and **mental** health literacy for education and health professionals (n = 2). Most studies were undertaken in Brazil (n = 6), Mexico (n = 5), and Chile (n = 4). Only 3 studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs), 4 were pilot RCTs, and 15 were naturalistic, acceptability, or feasibility studies. The three RCTs identified showed disparate results, but overall, there are challenges to face. Better results are seen in the short-term (postintervention or after 3 months), but most studies do not explore outcomes for long enough (follow-up after 6 or 12 months). Most of the feasibility and pilot studies showed reasonably good acceptability for a wide range of strategies but difficulties to engage and retain participants for long enough or adhering to established protocols. Conclusion: This study shows that Internet-based interventions for the prevention and treatment of **mental** disorders are growing rapidly in Latin America, but there are few studies on effectiveness and cost effectiveness, making it difficult to provide the evidence needed to justify scaling up these interventions.

Despite its prevalence, quality treatment for trichotillomania is often difficult to find. The use of telepsychology has been an effective method for disseminating treatment services for a variety of mental health conditions. However, no research has examined the use of telepsychology to treat trichotillomania. This randomized **controlled** trial used Acceptance and Commitment Therapy Enhanced Behavior Therapy delivered by way of telepsychology to treat trichotillomania in adults. The study compared an active treatment condition (n = 12) to a delayed treatment waitlist **control** condition (n = 10). Results showed significant reductions in hair pulling severity from pre- to post-treatment compared to the waitlist condition. The 22 participants all received treatment and were combined to examine overall treatment effects from pre-treatment to a 12-week follow-up. The effect of treatment on hair pulling severity remained significant at follow-up. Measures of psychological flexibility and perceived shame also saw significant improvement. Quality of life, however, did not improve over the course of treatment. The findings demonstrate that telepsychology is a viable option to disseminate treatment for trichotillomania.  2018 Elsevier Inc. EID: 2-s2.0-85046370384
1. **Pilot evaluation of a web-based acceptance and commitment therapy program to promote mental health skills in university students**
Objective: This study evaluated a 4-week web-based **acceptance** and **commitment** therapy (ACT) mental health promotion program called YOLO (You Only Live Once) for university students. Method: A total of 130 participants were randomized to one of three intervention groups investigating varied program delivery methods. Primary outcomes assessed: depression, anxiety, stress, well-being, self-compassion, alcohol use, and **life** satisfaction. ACT processes assessed: acceptance, cognitive fusion, education values, valued living, and mindfulness. Results: Improvement on the primary outcomes and ACT processes did not differ among the three intervention groups. Analyses showed significant improvements on all primary outcomes (except alcohol use), and on all ACT processes. All ACT processes mediated changes on one or more primary outcomes in the intent-to-treat sample. Intervention effects were consistent on most primary outcomes and ACT processes across three sample groupings. Conclusions: These preliminary findings provide support for a web-based ACT mental health promotion program for university students.  2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. EID: 2-s2.0-85050502026
2. **Web-Based Self-Help for Preventing Mental Health Problems in Universities: Comparing Acceptance and Commitment Training to Mental Health Education**
Objective: This study sought to test the feasibility of a web-based Acceptance and Commitment Training (ACT) prototype prevention program called ACT on College Life (ACT-CL). Method: A sample of 234 university students was randomized to either the ACT-CL website or a mental health education (MHE) website. Results: Findings indicated a lower level of user engagement and satisfaction ratings with the prototype of ACT-CL than the MHE website. There were no significant differences between conditions on **outcome** measures at post or follow-up. However, statistical trends suggested the MHE condition actually led to greater remission of severe symptoms than the ACT-CL condition among those with severe symptoms at baseline. There were no differences between conditions on ACT process of change measures. Changes in psychological flexibility were predictive of changes in mental health across conditions, but relations dissipated over time. Furthermore, greater engagement in some components of ACT-CL predicted improvements in psychological flexibility, though not on mental health outcomes. Conclusions: The effects of the ACT-CL program on mental health outcomes and ACT process measures were largely equivalent to those of an education website, although there was a lower level of program engagement with ACT-CL. Findings are discussed in the context of feasibility issues and lessons learned for program revisions.  2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. EID: 2-s2.0-84958680658
3. **Guided and unguided Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for social anxiety disorder and/or panic disorder provided via the Internet and a smartphone application: A randomized controlled trial**
Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) can be effective in treating anxiety disorders, yet there has been no study on Internet-delivered ACT for social anxiety disorder (SAD) and panic disorder (PD), nor any study investigating whether therapist guidance is superior to unguided self-help when supplemented with a smartphone application. In the current trial, n = 152 participants diagnosed with SAD and/or PD were randomized to therapist-guided or unguided treatment, or a waiting-list **control** group. Both treatment groups used an Internet-delivered ACT-based treatment program and a smartphone application. Outcome measures were self-rated general and social anxiety and panic symptoms. Treatment groups saw reduced general (d = 0.39) and social anxiety (d = 0.70), but not panic symptoms (d = 0.05) compared to the waiting-list group, yet no differences in outcomes were observed between guided and unguided interventions. We conclude that Internet-delivered ACT is appropriate for treating SAD and potentially PD. Smartphone applications may partially compensate for lack of therapist support.  2016 EID: 2-s2.0-84991059235
4. **Rural Assertive Community Treatment and Telepsychiatry**
Assertive community treatment (ACT) is an evidence-based treatment for patients with severe and persistent mental illness. ACT has been shown to reduce inpatient hospitalization and is increasingly being used as a mainstay of evidence-based psychiatric practice for these clinical populations. The increasing implementation of evidence-based practices has led to the expansion of ACT in rural areas. Variability in the adaptation of ACT in rural areas has included accommodation by teams to multiple barriers. One way to increase psychiatric professional efficiency in rural areas is with telepsychiatry and possibly with rural ACT, but with unknown effects on fidelity and outcomes. Telepsychiatry has been considered a means of expanding the reach of and access to ACT. Concerns about the use of telepsychiatry by ACT teams include the psychiatrist's ability to develop a relationship with patients and staff and difficulties observing the patient's entire living environment via telemedicine. The Piedmont Community Services Board (CSB) Program for Assertive Community Treatment (PACT) serves patients in southwestern Virginia in collaboration with the Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine. The Piedmont CSB PACT uses telemedicine to expand the treating psychiatrist's reach and contact with PACT patients, increasing the efficiency of the psychiatrist's PACT time. Telemedicine is used for crisis intervention and augmentation of regular ongoing visits. The goals of this project were to measure patient, staff, and psychiatrist comfort and satisfaction with the use of telepsychiatry in ACT in addition to monitoring routine **outcome** measures.  2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

0. **Study to promote innovation in rural integrated telepsychiatry (SPIRIT): Rationale and design of a randomized comparative effectiveness trial of managing complex psychiatric disorders in rural primary care clinics**
Objective: Managing complex psychiatric disorders like PTSD and **bipolar** disorder is challenging in Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) delivering care to U.S residents living in underserved rural areas. This protocol paper describes SPIRIT, a pragmatic comparative effectiveness trial designed to compare two approaches to managing PTSD and **bipolar** disorder in FQHCs. Interventions: Treatment comparators are: 1) Telepsychiatry Collaborative Care, which integrates consulting telepsychiatrists into primary care teams, and 2) Telepsychiatry Enhanced Referral, where telepsychiatrists and telepsychologists treat patients directly. Methods: Because Telepsychiatry Enhanced Referral is an adaptive intervention, a Sequential, Multiple Assignment, Randomized Trial design is used. Twenty-four FQHC clinics without on-site psychiatrists or psychologists are participating in the trial. The sample is patients screening positive for PTSD and/or **bipolar** disorder who are not already engaged in pharmacotherapy with a mental health specialist. Intervention fidelity is measured but not controlled. Patient treatment engagement is measured but not required, and intent-to-treat analysis will be used. Survey questions measure treatment engagement and effectiveness. The Short-Form 12 Mental Health Component Summary (SF-12 MCS) is the primary outcome. Results: A third (34%) of those enrolled (n = 1004) are racial/ethnic minorities, 81% are not fully employed, 68% are Medicaid enrollees, 7% are uninsured, and 62% live in poverty. Mental health related quality of life (SF-12 MCS) is 2.5 standard deviations below the national mean. Discussion: We hypothesize that patients randomized to Telepsychiatry Collaborative Care will have better outcomes than those randomized to Telepsychiatry Enhanced Referral because a higher proportion will engage in evidence-based treatment.  2019 EID: 2-s2.0-85078769514
1. **The effects of psychoeducation and telepsychiatric follow-up on social functioning and medication adherence in the patients with schizophrenia [izofreni hastalari{dotless}na verilen ruhsal eitim ve telepsikiyatrik izlemenin hasta ilevsellii ve ila uyumuna etkisi]**
Objective: This randomized-controlled experimental study was conducted to determine the effects of psychoeducation in the clinic and **regular** telepsychiatric follow-up (via telephone) after discharge on social functioning, drug adherence of patients with schziophrenia. Methods: This study was performed on totally 62 patients, assigned to experiment (n=32) and **control** (n=30) groups, from 1st July 2010 to 31st May 2011, being followed in Mental Health Center of Kayseri Training and Research Hospital and meeting research criteria. Patients' characteristics were recorded by a form. For the patients in experiment and **control** groups; before education, after education and after 6-months telephone follow-up Scales of Medication Adherence Rating, Social Functioning were applied. In the psychoeducation process, the patients in the experiment group were given 'Manual of Information for Patients with Schziophrenia' prepared by the researcher. After discharge, patients were interviewed by telephone for 6 months, every week regularly in average for 15 minutes. A standard, semi-structured interview form consisting of 7 questions were used for telephone follow-up. Results: For the patients in the experiment group, after physchoeducation and telephone follow-up, the mean scores for adherence to treatment and social functioning scores were increased, the differences between before and after education and after telephone follow-up were significant. Again, the differences between the mean scores of adherence to treatment and social functioning were significant after education and after telephone follow-up for the patients in both experiment and **control** groups. In addition, the group and time interaction of the mean scores for adherence to treatment and social functioning were significant. Conclusion: According to these results, the psychoeducation and telepsychiatric follow-up via telephone induced increases in adherence to treatment and social functioning for the patients. Supporting the patients with **schizophrenia** via psychoeducation and telepsychiatric follow-up had positive impact on these patients and these techniques are recommended to be used in patient follow-up at home.

2. **Online psycho-education to the treatment of bipolar disorder: Protocol of a randomized controlled trial**
Background: Bipolar disorder patients frequently present recurrent episodes and often experience subsyndromal symptoms, cognitive impairment and difficulties in functioning, with a low quality of life, illness relapses and recurrent hospitalization. Early diagnosis and appropriate intervention may play a role in preventing neuroprogression in this disorder. New technologies represent an opportunity to develop standardized psychological treatments using internet-based tools that overcome some of the limitations of face-to-face treatments, in that they are readily accessible and the timing of therapy can be tailored to user needs and availability. However, although many psychological programs are offered through the web and mobile devices for **bipolar** disorder, there is a lack of high quality evidence concerning their efficacy and effectiveness due to the great variability in measures and methodology used. Methods: This clinical trial is a simple-blind randomized trial within a European project to compare an internet-based intervention with treatment as usual. Bipolar disorder patients are to be included and randomly assigned to one of two groups: 1) the experimental group (tele-care support) and 2) the **control** group. Participants in both groups will be evaluated at baseline (pre-treatment) and post-treatment. Discussion: This study describes the design of a clinical trial based on psychoeducation intervention that may have a significant impact on both prognosis and treatment in **bipolar** disorder. Specifically, bringing different services together (service aggregation), it is hoped that the approach proposed will significantly increase the impact of information and communication technologies on access and adherence to treatment, quality of the service, patient safety, patient and professional satisfaction, and quality of life of patients.

3. **Tecla: A telephone- and text-message based telemedical concept for patients with severe mental health disorders - study protocol for a controlled, randomized, study**
Background: Severe mental disorders like psychotic disorders including **schizophrenia** and schizoaffective disorders have a 12-month-prevalence of 2.6, **bipolar** disorders of 1.5 % in Germany. The relapse risk is high; so many patients need intensive monitoring and lifelong treatment. A high medication adherence is essential for a successful treatment. But in practice, medication adherence is low and decreases over time. Telemedical care concepts might improve treatment and bridge gaps between in- and outpatient treatment. A telemedical care concept based on **regular** telephone calls and short text messages was developed. The primary objective is to assess whether **regular** telephone calls and text messages can improve the medication adherence of patients. Secondary objectives are the reduction of rehospitalization rates, the improvement of quality of life and of the severity of symptoms. Methods/design: The Tecla study (Post stationary telemedical care of patients with severe psychiatric disorders) is a two-armed prospective randomized **controlled** trial. The participants in the intervention group receive in addition to usual care **regular** telephone calls every 2 weeks and weekly text messages on patient-individual topics during a 6 months period. Patients in the **control** group receive only **regular** care. Inclusion criteria are a physician-diagnosed **bipolar** disorder, schizoaffective disorder or **schizophrenia** and a signed informed consent. Exclusion criteria are planned inpatient treatments within the next 6 months and being non-reachable by phone. After 3 and 6 months both groups receive follow up assessments. Discussion: The primary objective of this study is the medication adherence that is measured with the Medication Adherence Report Scale, German version (MARS-D). The MARS-D is a self-report with five items. Adherent behaviour is mostly overestimated using self-reports. The strength of the MARS-D is to detect non-adherent behaviour. The original Medication Adherence Report Scale in English language (MARS-5) was developed to encourage the patient to answer truthfully to the questions that are asked in a non-threatening and non-judgmental way to minimize social desirability bias in admitting non-adherent behaviour.  2015 Stentzel et al.

4. **Psychotherapeutic intervention by telephone**
Psychotherapy conducted over the telephone has received increasing amounts of empirical attention given practical advantages that side-step treatment barriers encountered in traditional office-based care. The utility and efficacy of telephone therapy appears generalizable across diverse clinical populations seeking care in community-based hospital settings. Treatment barriers common to older adults suggest that telephone therapy may be an efficient and effective mental health resource for this population. This paper describes empirical studies of telehealth interventions and case examples with psychotherapy conducted via telephone on the Spinal Cord Injury Unit of the Palo Alto Veterans' Administration. Telephone therapy as appears to be a viable intervention with the aging population.  2008 Dove Medical Press Limited. All rights reserved. EID: 2-s2.0-47849100360
5. **Effect of psychoeducation and telepsychiatric follow up given to the caregiver of the schizophrenic patient on family burden, depression and expression of emotion**
Objective: This randomized-controlled experimental study was conducted to determine the effects of psychoeducation in the inpatient clinic and **regular** telepsychiatric follow-up (via telephone) after discharge on emotional expression, depression and family burden of primary caregivers of the schizophrenic patients. Methods: This study was performed on 62 caregivers of the schizophrenic patients, assigned to experiment (n=32) and **control** (n=30) groups, from 1st July 2010 to 31st May 2011. The Scales for Expressed Emotion, the Beck Depression and the Zarit Family Burden were applied for the caregivers in experiment and **control** groups before education, after education and after 6-months telephone follow-up. Results: The mean scores of the caregivers in experiment group on family burden, emotional expression and depression were decreased after education and after telephone follow-up and difference was significant (p &lt; 0.001). Conclusions: Psychoeducation and telepsychiatric follow-up via telephone induced decrease in family burden, emotional expression and depressive symptoms for their caregivers and was a support for the family in the patient care.

0. **Predicting post treatment client satisfaction between behavioural activation for depression delivered either in-person or via home-based telehealth**
Introduction: Treatment engagement, adherence, cancellations and other patient-centric data are important predictors of **treatment** outcome. But often these data are only examined retrospectively. In this investigation, we analysed data from a clinical trial focused on innovative delivery of depression **treatment** to identify which patients are likely to prefer either in-home or in-person **treatment** based on pre-treatment characteristics. Methods: Patient satisfaction was assessed in a trial of individuals with depression treated using identical behavioural activation therapy protocols in person or through videoconferencing to the home (N = 87 at post treatment: 42 in-person and 45 in-home participants). The Client Satisfaction Questionnaire was administered at the end of the treatment. A Tobit regression model was used to assess moderation using **treatment** assignment. Regression lines were generated to model **treatment** satisfaction as a function of **treatment** assignment and to identify whether and where the groups intersected. We examined the distributions of the contributing moderators to the subsets of participants above and below the intersection point to identify differences. Results: While no significant differences in patient satisfaction were observed between the two groups, or between patients receiving **treatment** by different providers, baseline characteristics of the sample could be used to differentiate those with a preference for traditional, in-office care from those preferring in-home care. Discussion: Participants who were more likely to prefer in-home care were characterized by larger proportions of veterans and lower-ranked enlisted service members. They also had more severe symptoms at baseline and less formal education. Understanding client reactions when selecting **treatment** modality may allow for a more satisfying patient experience.

1. **Enthusiasm for homework and improvement of psychological distress in subthreshold depression during behavior therapy: Secondary analysis of data from a randomized controlled trial**
Background: Cognitive **behavioral** therapy (CBT) usually involves homework, the completion of which is a known predictor of a positive outcome. The aim of the present study was to examine the session-by-session relationships between enthusiasm to complete the homework and the improvement of psychological distress in depressed people through the course of therapy. Methods: Working people with subthreshold depression were recruited to participate in the telephone CBT (tCBT) program with demonstrated effectiveness. Their enthusiasm for homework was enhanced with motivational interviewing techniques and was measured by asking two questions: "How strongly do you feel you want to do this homework?" and "How confident do you feel you can actually accomplish this homework?" at the end of each session. The outcome was the K6 score, which was administered at the start of each session. The K6 is an index of psychological distress including depression and anxiety. We used structural equation modeling (SEM) to elucidate the relationships between enthusiasm and the K6 scores from session to session. Results: The best fitting model suggested that, throughout the course of **behavior** therapy (BT), enthusiasm to complete the homework was negatively correlated with the K6 scores for the subsequent session, while the K6 score measured at the beginning of the session did not influence the enthusiasm to complete the homeworks assigned for that session. Conclusions: Empirical data now support the practitioners of BT when they try to enhance their patient's enthusiasm for homework regardless of the participant's distress, which then would lead to a reduction in distress in the subsequent week.  2015 Hayasaka et al.

2. **Exploring the relationship between the acceptability of an internet-based intervention for depression in primary care and clinical outcomes: Secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial**
Background: Depression is one of the most prevalent psychological disorders worldwide. Although psychotherapy for depression is effective, there are barriers to its implementation in primary care in Spain. The use of the Internet has been shown to be a feasible solution. However, the acceptability of Internet-based interventions has not been studied sufficiently. Objective: To assess the acceptability of an Internet-based intervention (IBI) for depression in primary care, and explore the relationship between expectations and satisfaction and the improvement in the clinical variables in primary care patients receiving this intervention. Furthermore, it offers data about the effects of some sociodemographic characteristics on these acceptability variables and analyzes whether the expectations are related to finalizing the intervention. Methods: Data were based on depressive patients who were participants in a randomized **controlled** trial. In the present study, we present the data from all the participants in the Internet intervention groups (N = 198). All the participants filled out the expectation and satisfaction scales (six-item scales regarding **treatment** logic, satisfaction, recommending, usefulness for other disorders, usefulness for the patient, and unpleasantness), the Beck Depression Inventory-II, and the secondary outcome measures: depression and anxiety impairment, and positive and negative affect. Results: Results showed that participants' expectations and satisfaction with the program were both high and differences in expectations and satisfaction depended on some sociodemographic variables (age: older people have higher expectations; sex: women have greater satisfaction). A positive relationship between these variables and intervention efficacy was found: expectations related to usefulness for the patient were a statistically related predictor to the results on the BDI-II (Beta = 0.364), and the perception of how logical the **treatment** is (Beta = 0.528) was associated with change in the clinical variable. Furthermore, the higher the expectations, the higher the improvements exhibited by the patients in all measures evaluated during the ten intervention modules. High expectations were also directly related to finalizing the intervention. Conclusions: This is the first study in Spain to address this issue in the field of IBIs for depression in primary care. The IBI showed high acceptance related to the intervention's efficacy and completion. Research on IBI acceptability could help to implement the **treatment** offered.

3. **Telephone-based cognitive behavioural therapy for female patients 1-year post-bariatric surgery: A pilot study**
Objective: Although bariatric surgery is a durable **treatment** for patients with severe obesity, it does not directly address behavioural and psychological factors that potentially contribute to weight regain post-surgery. Psychological interventions, such as **cognitive** behavioural therapy (CBT), can be challenging to access due to physical limitations and practical barriers. Telephone-based CBT (Tele-CBT) can improve eating psychopathology and psychological distress before and after surgery. Given the frequent occurrence/recurrence of problematic eating-related and psychological issues many patients face 1-year post-surgery, this open-trial pilot study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of Tele-CBT delivered 1-year post-surgery as an adjunctive **treatment** to the usual standard of bariatric care. Methods: Patients (n = 43) received six 1-h Tele-CBT sessions delivered weekly beginning at 1-year post-surgery. Patients completed questionnaire packages before and after the intervention to assess changes in binge eating (BES), emotional eating (EES), depression (PHQ-9), and anxiety (GAD-7). Results: Thirty-two patients completed Tele-CBT yielding a 74.4% completion rate. Participants reported significant improvements on the Binge Eating Scale (t(31) = 3.794, p = 0.001), Emotional Eating Scale (t(31) = 3.508, p = 0.001), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 Item Scale (z = 2.371, p = 0.018), and Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 Item Scale (z = 3.546, p < 0.001) immediately following Tele-CBT. Discussion: The results demonstrate that Tele-CBT delivered 1-year post-surgery may improve binge eating, emotional eating, depression, and anxiety. Additional research is warranted to examine whether these changes translate into long-term improvements in bariatric surgery outcomes.  2019 Asia Oceania Association for the Study of Obesity EID: 2-s2.0-85070292051
4. **Core belief content examined in a large sample of patients using online cognitive behaviour therapy**
Abstract Background Computerised **cognitive** behavioural therapy provides a unique opportunity to collect and analyse data regarding the idiosyncratic content of people's core beliefs about the self, others and the world. Methods 'Beating the Blues' users recorded a core belief derived through the downward arrow technique. Core beliefs from 1813 mental health patients were coded into 10 categories. Results The most common were global self-evaluation, attachment, and competence. Women were more likely, and men were less likely (than chance), to provide an attachment-related core belief; and men were more likely, and women less likely, to provide a self-competence-related core belief. This may be linked to gender differences in sources of self-esteem. Those who were suffering from anxiety were more likely to provide power- and control-themed core beliefs and less likely to provide attachment core beliefs than chance. Finally, those who had thoughts of suicide in the preceding week reported less competence themed core beliefs and more global self-evaluation (e.g., 'I am useless') core beliefs than chance. Limitations Concurrent symptom level was not available. The sample was not nationally representative, and featured programme completers only. Conclusions Men and women may focus on different core beliefs in the context of CBT. Those suffering anxiety may need a therapeutic focus on power and control. A complete rejection of the self (not just within one domain, such as competence) may be linked to thoughts of suicide. Future research should examine how individual differences and symptom severity influence core beliefs.  2015 The Authors. EID: 2-s2.0-84938815259
5. **Pregnancy and the Acceptability of Computer-Based Versus Traditional Mental Health Treatments**
Background: Recent recommendations urge increased depression screening in pregnant and postpartum women, potentially increasing demand for treatment. Computer-based psychotherapy treatments may address some of perinatal women's unique mental health **treatment** needs and barriers. Materials and Methods: We conducted a quantitative survey of pregnant women (12 weeks of gestation) on preferences regarding computer-based therapies compared with traditional therapies (psychotherapy and medication). Nonpregnant women and men served as comparison groups. Participants were provided descriptions of three computer-based therapies: Video telehealth therapy (VTT), computer-assisted therapy (CAT), and self-guided online therapy (SGO). Participants were asked to select all options that they would consider for **treatment** as well as first choice preference. The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) assessed current depressive symptomatology, and the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) assessed psychiatric history. Results: Participants included pregnant females (n = 111), nonpregnant females (n = 147), and males (n = 54). Among pregnant women, 77.5% (n = 86) indicated that they would consider some form of computer-based therapy for mental health **treatment** during pregnancy; VTT was the most commonly considered, followed by CAT and SGO. When asked to select their preferred intervention, traditional talk therapy was the first choice among all three groups, controlling for **treatment** history and PHQ-9 score. About one-third of pregnant women chose some form of computer-based therapy as their top choice. Conclusions: While computer-based therapies were acceptable to most pregnant women in this sample, traditional talk therapy was the preferred option. Future research should consider how to tailor computer-based therapies to the unique needs of perinatal women.  2017, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. EID: 2-s2.0-85031664085
6. **A positive psychology intervention for patients with bipolar depression: a randomized pilot trial**
Background: There are few effective treatments for bipolar depression, a common and debilitating illness. Aims: We aimed to examine the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a four-week, telephone-delivered positive psychology (PP) intervention for patients with bipolar depression. Methods: Twenty-five patients hospitalized for bipolar depression were randomized to receive a PP (n = 14) or **control** condition (CC; n = 11) intervention. Following discharge, participants completed weekly exercises and phone calls with a study trainer. PP intervention feasibility was assessed by the number of exercises completed, and acceptability was examined on five-point Likert-type scales of ease and utility. Between-group differences on psychological constructs at 4 and 8weeks post-enrollment were assessed using mixed effects regression models. Results: Participants in the PP group completed an average of three out of four PP exercises and found PP exercises to be subjectively helpful, though neither easy nor difficult. Compared to CC, the PP intervention led to trends towards greater improvements in positive affect and optimism at follow-up, with large effect sizes (modified Cohens d = 0.951.24). PP had variable, non-significant effects on negative psychological constructs. Conclusions: Larger, randomized trials are needed to further evaluate the efficacy of this intervention in this high-risk population.  2018,  2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

7. **Common Factors and Depressive Symptom Relief Trajectories in Group Teletherapy for Persons Ageing with HIV**
Telepsychology research has focused primarily on **treatment** efficacy, with far less attention devoted to how common factors relate to teletherapy outcomes. This research identified trajectories of depressive symptom relief in 105 older people living with HIV with elevated depressive symptoms enrolled in a randomized clinical trial testing two 12-session group teletherapies and compared common factors (e.g., therapeutic alliance and group cohesion) across depressive symptom trajectory groups. Growth mixture modelling of weekly depression scores identified three depressive symptom change groups: (1) early improvers (31%) who reported reductions in depressive symptoms by Session 4; (2) delayed improvers (16%) whose symptoms improved after Session 5 and (3) non-improvers (53%). Therapeutic alliance was unrelated to **treatment** outcome group. Group cohesion was greater in early improvers than non-improvers. Group cohesion was unexpectedly lower, and group member similarity was greater in delayed improvers than non-improvers. Early improvers had been living with HIV/AIDS for fewer years than non-improvers. In group teletherapy, group cohesion and group member similarity are more important than clienttherapist alliance. Copyright  2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Key Practitioner Message: In group teletherapy with older people living with HIV (OPLWHIV), three latent outcome trajectory groups emerged over the 12-week **treatment** period: (1) non-improvers (53%); (2) early improvers (31%) and (3) delayed improvers (16%). In group teletherapy with OPLWHIV, group cohesion is a stronger predictor of depressive symptom relief than is clienttherapist alliance. OPLWHIV in group teletherapy who do not respond to **treatment** until the latter therapy sessions can still experience depressive symptom relief comparable with early responders.

8. **Effect of psychotherapy for depression via home telehealth on glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes: Subgroup analysis of a randomized clinical trial**
Objective: We evaluated the impact of telemedicine-delivered behaviour activation **treatment** (BAT) on glycemic **control** in a subgroup of older adults with diabetes who participated in a randomized **controlled** trial for depression. Research design and methods: We randomized older adults with major depression to same-room or telemedicine BAT. Each group received eight weekly sessions. For the subgroup analysis, we identified individuals with type 2 diabetes and obtained hemoglobin A1c at baseline and 12 months follow-up. We used mixed-effects models (MEM) for repeated measures analysis to compare the longitudinal mean A1c. We estimated model-derived mean A1c values and considered an adjusted model to account for baseline health status. Results: We included 90 individuals with type 2 diabetes of the original 241 in the subgroup analysis (43 in telemedicine and 47 in same room). Treatment groups were not significantly different at baseline for demographics, depression, anxiety or A1c levels (telemedicine 6.9 vs. same room 7.3, p = 0.19). Baseline mean A1c for the telemedicine group remained at 6.9 (55 mmol/mol) at 12 months, whereas baseline mean A1c for the same-room group increased to 7.7 (61 mmol/mol). Longitudinal trajectories of model-derived mean A1c indicated a significant main effect of **treatment** group on mean A1c value at study end (difference = 0.82, 95% CI 1.41, 0.24). Adjusted analyses gave comparable results. Conclusions: Telemedicine-delivered BAT was superior to same room in achieving lower mean A1c values in participants with type 2 diabetes, suggesting BAT-delivered via telemedicine is a viable **treatment** option for adults with diabetes.

9. **A Scenario-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Mobile App to Reduce Dysfunctional Beliefs in Individuals with Depression: A Randomized Controlled Trial**
Introduction: While self-administered mobile app-based **cognitive** **behavioral** therapy (CBT) has shown efficiency and effectiveness over the past decade, attempts to address automatic and negative beliefs have been lacking. The purpose of this study was to introduce and verify a mobile app that directly intervenes in dysfunctional thoughts. This app-based **treatment** includes recognizing automatic and negative thoughts of the protagonist of scenarios, writing advice directly to the main character, and sharing advice provided by other participants. Materials and Methods: Thirty-four participants diagnosed with Other Specified Depressive Disorder were recruited and randomly allocated to a CBT-based mobile-app program, the Todac Todac (TT group), or a daily mood chart app program (control group). Participants were asked to use the software for 3 weeks. Assessments for autonomic thoughts and clinical symptoms were administered at baseline and at a follow-up evaluation. Results: After completing the 3-week program, Dysfunctional Attitude Scale (DAS) scores in TT group were lower than they were in the **control** group. In clinical measures, both TT group and **control** group showed reduced Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) scores and situation-dependent trait version of State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-X2) at follow-up. However, TT group showed significantly reduced STAI-X2 scores compared to **control** group. For all participants, changes in DAS scores were correlated with BDI-II and STAI-X2 scores. Conclusions: Our preliminary findings provide promising evidence that scenario-based CBT mobile apps can be used to deliver feasible and efficacious **cognitive** therapy. Long-term research is needed to determine the impact and effectiveness of this new **treatment** format.  Copyright 2018, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2018. EID: 2-s2.0-85053678284
10. **Telephone-administered psychotherapy in combination with antidepressant medication for the acute treatment of major depressive disorder**
Background Telephone-administered psychotherapies (T-P) provided as an adjunct to antidepressant medication may improve response rates in major depressive disorder (MDD). The goal of this study was to compare telephone-administered social rhythm therapy (T-SRT) and telephone-administered intensive clinical management (T-ICM) as adjuncts to antidepressant medication for MDD. A secondary goal was to compare T-P with Treatment as Usual (TAU) as adjunctive **treatment** to medication for MDD. Methods 221 adult out-patients with MDD, currently depressed, were randomly assigned to 8 sessions of weekly T-SRT (n=110) or T-ICM (n=111), administered as an adjunct to agomelatine. Both psychotherapies were administered entirely by telephone, by trained psychologists who were blind to other aspects of treatment. The 221 patients were a posteriori matched with 221 depressed outpatients receiving TAU (controls). The primary outcome measure was the percentage of responders at 8 weeks post-treatment. Results No significant differences were found between T-SRT and T-ICM. But T-P was associated with higher response rates (65.4% vs 54.8%, p=0.02) and a trend toward higher remission rates (33.2% vs 25.1%; p=0.06) compared to TAU. Limitations Short term study. Conclusions This study is the first assessing the short-term effects of an add-on, brief, telephone-administered psychotherapy in depressed patients treated with antidepressant medication. Eight sessions of weekly telephone-delivered psychotherapy as an adjunct to antidepressant medication resulted in improved response rates relative to medication alone. EID: 2-s2.0-84944809872
11. **Trajectory of cost overtime after psychotherapy for depression in older Veterans via telemedicine**
Background Little evidence exists regarding the costs of telemedicine, especially considering changes over time. This analysis aimed to analyze trajectory of healthcare cost before, during, and after a **behavioral** activation intervention delivered via telepsychology and same-room delivery to elderly Veterans with depression. Methods 241 participants were randomly assigned into one of two study groups: **behavioral** activation for depression via telemedicine or via same-room treatment. Patients received 8 weeks of weekly 60-min individual sessions of **behavioral** activation for depression. Primary outcomes were collected at 12-months. Inpatient, outpatient, pharmacy, and total costs were collected from VA Health Economics Resource Center (HERC) datasets for FY 19982014 and compared between the two **treatment** groups. Generalized mixed models were used to investigate the trajectories over time. Results Overall cost, as well as, outpatient and pharmacy cost show increasing trend over time. Unadjusted and adjusted trajectories over time for any cost were not different between the two **treatment** groups. There was a significant overall increasing trend over time for outpatient (p<0.001) and total cost (p<0.001) but not for inpatient (p=0.543) or pharmacy cost (p=0.084). Limitations Generalizability to younger, healthier populations may be limited due to inclusion criteria for study participants. Conclusion Healthcare costs before, during, and after intervention did not differ between the telemedicine and in-person delivery methods. Outpatient costs accounted for most of the increasing trend of cost over time. These results support policies to use both telehealth and in-person **treatment** modalities to effectively and efficiently provide high quality care.  2016 Elsevier B.V. EID: 2-s2.0-85007545283
12. **Telephone-based care management for older adults initiated on psychotropic medication**
Objective This study aimed to explore the longitudinal, 6-month symptom course of older adults newly started on an antidepressant or anxiolytic by non-psychiatrist physicians and enrolled in a care management program. Method This is a naturalistic cohort study of older adults (age 65 years) receiving pharmacotherapy and telephone-based care management. Participants are non-institutionalized adults participating in Pennsylvania's Pharmaceutical Assistance Contract for the Elderly who completed telephone-based clinical assessments including demographic data, self-report on history of psychiatric **treatment** and adherence, and standardized symptom scales. Results A total of 162 participants with an average age of 77.2 years (SD 6.8) were followed and, for analysis, split into two groups by PHQ-9 score: 75 (46.3%) scoring 0-4 (minimally symptomatic group, MSG) and 87 (53.7%) scoring 5 (symptomatic group, SG). Over 6 months, the SG improved with PHQ-9 scores beginning on average at 10.0 (SD 4.6) and falling to 5.4 (SD 4.2) (F(1, 86) = 29.53, p &lt; 0.0001). The MSG had no significant change in depressive symptoms. Emotional health as measured by SF-12 Mental Composite Score mirrored the PHQ-9 change and lack thereof in the SG and MSG, respectively. No clinical or demographic features were associated with symptom improvement in the SG although they were more likely to report medication adherence (66.7% vs. 44.0%, 2(1) = 8.4, p = 0.0037) compared with the MSG. Conclusions Participation of symptomatic older adults initiated on psychotropic medication in a telephone-based care management program was associated with improvement in depressive symptoms and overall emotional well-being, notable findings given participants' advanced age, state-wide distribution, and history of limited utilization of mental health care.  2012 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.

13. **Cross-cultural aspects of depression management in primary care**
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a prevalent illness in minority populations. Minority patients with MDD are often unrecognized and untreated. This review examines promising interventions to address MDD in primary care settings, where minority groups are more likely to seek care. Since 2010, eleven interventions have been developed to address patient-specific and provider-specific barriers, many of which are adaptations of the collaborative care model. Other promising interventions include cultural tailoring of the collaborative care model, as well as the addition of telepsychiatry, motivational interviewing, cultural consultation, and innovations in interpreting. Overall, collaborative care was found feasible and improved satisfaction and **treatment** engagement of depressed minority patients in primary care. It remains inconclusive whether these newer intervention models improve MDD **treatment** outcomes. Future research will be needed to establish the effectiveness of these intervention models in improving the **treatment** outcomes of minority populations with MDD.

14. **Cost-effectiveness of a novel e-health depression service**
Objectives: A recent trial assessed feasibility of an e-health service ("Improvehealth.eu") to support depression care and reported positive outcomes. Our objective was to examine cost-effectiveness of the Improvehealth.eu service. A baseline model was used to evaluate cost and effects of the intervention. Given the high uncertainty in the input space, a series of alternative scenarios were evaluated to challenge the result. The aim was to find if conservative or even pessimistic estimates and assumptions could result in a change of the cost-effectiveness from the baseline model. Materials and Methods: A probabilistic depression model combined with bootstrapping was built and populated with data from the literature and from the pilot efficacy trial of the e-health service. The core of the model was a stochastic mapping function that translated depression-specific outcomes to quality-adjusted life years. Correlated sampling was used to obtain unbiased and consistent piecewise linear transformation of Beck Depression Inventory scores to utilities. The results are shown as cost-effectiveness acceptability curves with value of information data. An extreme scenario analysis was then performed to deal with parameter, structural, and modeling uncertainty. Results: Cost-effectiveness of the e-health service was favorable because of low cost and high efficacy of the intervention. Apart from the most pessimistic one, none of the 13 alternative scenarios changed the preferred alternative. Conclusions: Improvehealth.eu is cost-effective relative to usual care, given the available efficacy data. Results of the health economic evaluation were robust to alternative assumptions, despite considerable uncertainty in input data.  Copyright 2013, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2013. EID: 2-s2.0-84891643082
15. **CTN-194 (PICCO): Design of a trial of citalopram for the prevention of depression and its consequences in HIV-Hepatitis C co-infected individuals initiating pegylated interferon/ribavirin therapy**
Hepatitis C (HCV)-related end stage liver disease is a primary cause of morbidity and mortality in people with HIV. Despite this, co-infected patients have low rates of HCV **treatment** initiation and completion. This is in large part due to the risk of pegylated-interferon alpha (PEG-IFN-)-related neuropsychiatric complications. We describe the design of a multicentre randomized, placebo-controlled trial that evaluates whether antidepressant prophylaxis is superior to early detection and **treatment** of depression in increasing the successful completion of HCV therapy. Seventy-six HIV+ adults with chronic HCV infection requiring therapy and with no contraindications to PEG-IFN-/ribavirin will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive citalopram or placebo starting three weeks prior to HCV treatment. A novel aspect of the trial design is the built-in management of emergent depression while maintaining the blinded **treatment** assignment. This will permit the comparison of prophylactic versus therapeutic use of citalopram. The primary outcome is the average proportion of prescribed PEG-IFN- and ribavirin doses taken per month at weeks 12 and 24, and will be compared between **treatment** arms. The study will also compare the development of moderate-to-severe depression between **treatment** arms. A unique feature of this trial will be the use of Telepsychiatry to standardize observer-administered neuropsychiatric evaluations. Assessments of anxiety, quality of life, and adherence to therapy, as well as pathogenetic studies of neuropsychiatric side effects, will be conducted. Intention-to-treat analyses using random regression modeling will be employed to analyze longitudinal data on prescribed PEG-IFN- and ribavirin doses. Survival analyses will be used to compare the time to the development of depression between the two arms. Effective prevention of a broad range of neuropsychiatric symptoms by citalopram has the potential to diminish PEG-IFN- associated morbidity and consequently, allow a greater number of patients to complete full therapy.  2008 Elsevier Inc.

16. **Implementing multifactorial psychotherapy research in online virtual environments (IMPROVE-2): Study protocol for a phase III trial of the MOST randomized component selection method for internet cognitive-behavioural therapy for depression**
Background: Depression is a global health challenge. Although there are effective psychological and pharmaceutical interventions, our best treatments achieve remission rates less than 1/3 and limited sustained recovery. Underpinning this efficacy gap is limited understanding of how complex psychological interventions for depression work. Recent reviews have argued that the active ingredients of therapy need to be identified so that therapy can be made briefer, more potent, and to improve scalability. This in turn requires the use of rigorous study designs that test the presence or absence of individual therapeutic elements, rather than standard comparative randomised **controlled** trials. One such approach is the Multiphase Optimization Strategy, which uses efficient experimentation such as factorial designs to identify active factors in complex interventions. This approach has been successfully applied to behavioural health but not yet to mental health interventions. Methods/Design: A Phase III randomised, single-blind balanced fractional factorial trial, based in England and conducted on the internet, randomized at the level of the patient, will investigate the active ingredients of internet cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) for depression. Adults with depression (operationalized as PHQ-9 score  10), recruited directly from the internet and from an UK National Health Service Improving Access to Psychological Therapies service, will be randomized across seven experimental factors, each reflecting the presence versus absence of specific **treatment** components (activity scheduling, functional analysis, thought challenging, relaxation, concreteness training, absorption, self-compassion training) using a 32-condition balanced fractional factorial design (2IV 7-2). The primary outcome is symptoms of depression (PHQ-9) at 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes include symptoms of anxiety and process measures related to hypothesized mechanisms. Discussion: Better understanding of the active ingredients of efficacious therapies, such as CBT, is necessary in order to improve and further disseminate these interventions. This study is the first application of a component selection experiment to psychological interventions in depression and will enable us to determine the main effect of each **treatment** component and its relative efficacy, and cast light on underlying mechanisms, so that we can systematically enhance internet CBT.

17. **Predictors of dropout in face-to-face and internet-based cognitive-behavioral therapy for bulimia nervosa in a randomized controlled trial**
Objective: We sought to identify predictors and moderators of failure to engage (i.e., pretreatment attrition) and dropout in both Internet-based and traditional face-to-face cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for bulimia nervosa. We also sought to determine if Internet-based **treatment** reduced failure to engage and dropout. Method: Participants (N=191, 98% female) were randomized to Internet-based CBT (CBT4BN) or traditional face-to-face group CBT (CBTF2F). Sociodemographics, clinical history, eating disorder severity, comorbid psychopathology, health status and quality of life, personality and temperament, and treatment-related factors were investigated as predictors. Results: Failure to engage was associated with lower perceived **treatment** credibility and expectancy (odds ratio [OR]=0.91, 95% CI: 0.82, 0.97) and body mass index (BMI) (OR=1.10; 95% CI: 1.03, 1.18). Dropout was predicted by not having a college degree (hazard ratio [HR]=0.55; 95% CI: 0.37, 0.81), novelty seeking (HR=1.02; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.03), previous CBT experience (HR=1.77; 95% CI: 1.16, 2.71), and randomization to the individual's nonpreferred **treatment** format (HR=1.95, 95% CI: 1.28, 2.96). Discussion: Those most at risk of failure to engage had a higher BMI and perceived **treatment** as less credible and less likely to succeed. Dropout was associated with less education, higher novelty seeking, previous CBT experience, and a mismatch between preferred and assigned treatment. Contrary to expectations, Internet-based CBT did not reduce failure to engage or dropout.  2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.(Int J Eat Disord 2017; 50:569577).  2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

18. **Acceptance of home-based telehealth problem-solving therapy for depressed, low-income homebound older adults: Qualitative interviews with the participants and aging-service case managers**
Purpose: To report low-income homebound older adults' experience of telehealth problem-solving therapy (tele-PST) and aging-service case managers' (CMs') experience/perception of client-level personal barriers to accessing psychotherapy in general and PST specifically. Design and Methods: The study sample consisted of 42 homebound older adults who participated in the feasibility and efficacy trial of tele-PST and completed 36-week follow-up assessments and 12 CMs of a large home-delivered meals program who referred their clients to the tele-PST trial. In-depth interviews with the older adults and written feedback and focus group discussions with the CMs provided the data. Results: Older adults reported a high rate of approval of PST procedures and acknowledged its positive **treatment** effect. Tele-PST participants were satisfied with videoconferenced sessions because they were convenient and allowed them to see their therapist. However, CMs reported that only about 10%-20% of potentially eligible older adults gave **oral** consent for PST. Significant **treatment** engagement barriers were the older adults' lack of motivation, denial of depression, perceived stigma, and other personal attitudinal factors. Implications: The real-world implementation of tele-PST or other psychotherapies needs to include educating and motivating depressed homebound elders to recognize their depression and accept treatment.  2013 The Author.

19. **The effect of telephone-based interpersonal psychotherapy for the treatment of postpartum depression: Study protocol for a randomized controlled trial**
Backgroun d: Substantial data indicate potential health consequences of untreated postpartum depression (PPD) on the mother, infant, and family. Studies have evaluated interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) as **treatment** for PPD; however, the results are questionable due to methodological limitations. A comprehensive review of maternal **treatment** preferences suggests that mothers favor 'talking therapy' as a form of PPD treatment. Unfortunately, IPT is not widely available, especially in rural and remote areas. To improve access to care, telepsychiatry has been introduced, including the provision of therapy via the telephone.Methods/Design: The purpose of this randomized **controlled** trial is to evaluate the effect of telephone-based IPT on the **treatment** of PPD. Stratification is based on self-reported history of depression and province. The target sample is 240 women. Currently, women from across Canada between 2 and 24 weeks postpartum are able to either self-identify as depressed and refer themselves to the trial or they may be referred by a health professional based on a score >12 on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Following contact by the trial coordinator, a detailed study explanation is provided. Women who fulfill the eligibility criteria (including a positive diagnostic assessment for major depression) and consent to participate are randomized to either the **control** group (standard postpartum care) or intervention group (standard postpartum care plus 12 telephone-based IPT sessions within 12 to 16 weeks, provided by trained nurses). Blinded research nurses telephone participants at 12, 24, and 36 weeks post-randomization to assess for PPD and other outcomes including depressive symptomatology, anxiety, couple adjustment, attachment, and health service utilization. Results from this ongoing trial will: (1) develop the body of knowledge concerning the effect of telephone-based IPT as a **treatment** option for PPD; (2) advance our understanding of training nurses to deliver IPT; (3) provide an economic evaluation of an IPT intervention; (4) investigate the utility of the EPDS in general clinical practice to identify depressed mothers; and (5) present valuable information regarding PPD, along with associated couple adjustment, co-morbid anxiety and self-reported attachment among a mixed rural and urban Canadian population.Trial registration: Current Controlled Trials Ltd.

20. **Pilot randomised controlled trial of Help4Mood, an embodied virtual agent-based system to support treatment of depression**
Introduction: Help4Mood is an interactive system with an embodied virtual agent (avatar) to assist in self-monitoring of patients receiving **treatment** for depression. Help4Mood supports self-report and biometric monitoring and includes elements of **cognitive** behavioural therapy. We aimed to evaluate system use and acceptability, to explore likely recruitment and retention rates in a clinical trial and to obtain an estimate of potential **treatment** response with a view to conducting a future randomised **controlled** trial (RCT). Methods: We conducted a pilot RCT of Help4Mood in three centres, in Romania, Spain and Scotland, UK. Patients with diagnosed depression (major depressive disorder) and current mild/moderate depressive symptoms were randomised to use the system for four weeks in addition to **treatment** as usual (TAU) or to TAU alone. Results: Twenty-seven individuals were randomised and follow-up data were obtained from 21 participants (12/13 Help4Mood, 9/14 TAU). Half of participants randomised to Help4Mood used it regularly (more than 10 times); none used it every day. Acceptability varied between users. Some valued the emotional responsiveness of the system, while others found it too repetitive. Intention to **treat** analysis showed a small difference in change of Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-2) scores (Help4Mood 5.7 points, TAU 4.2). Post-hoc on-treatment analysis suggested that participants who used Help4Mood regularly experienced a median change in BDI-2 of 8 points. Conclusion: Help4Mood is acceptable to some patients receiving **treatment** for depression although none used it as regularly as intended. Changes in depression symptoms in individuals who used the system regularly reached potentially meaningful levels.  2015,  The Author(s) 2015. EID: 2-s2.0-84983070104
21. **Comorbid Anxiety Disorders and Treatment of Depression in People With Multiple Sclerosis**
Objective: Anxiety is highly comorbid with depression, but little is known about the impact of anxiety disorders on the effectiveness of empirically supported psychotherapies for depression. We examined such outcomes for people with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and depression, with versus without comorbid anxiety disorders. Design: Participants with MS (N = 102) received 16 weeks of telephone-administered psychotherapy for depression and were followed for one year post-treatment. Results: Participants with comorbid anxiety disorders improved to a similar degree during **treatment** as those without anxiety disorders. Outcomes during follow-up were mixed, and thus we divided the anxiety diagnoses into distress and fear disorders. The distress disorder (GAD) was associated with elevated anxiety symptoms during and after treatment. In contrast, fear disorders (i.e., panic disorder, agoraphobia, social phobia, specific phobia) were linked to depression, specifically during follow-up, across 3 different measures. Conclusions: People with GAD receiving **treatment** for depression may benefit from additional services targeting anxiety more specifically, while those with comorbid fear disorders may benefit from services targeting maintenance of gains after treatment.  2010 American Psychological Association.

22. **Feasibility and impact of telemonitor-based depression care management for geriatric homecare patients**
Objective: The objective of this study was to test the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary clinical outcomes of a method to leverage existing home healthcare telemonitoring technology to deliver depression care management (DCM) to both Spanish- and English-speaking elderly homebound recipients of homecare services. Materials and Methods: Three stand-alone, nonprofit community homecare agencies located in New York, Vermont, and Miami participated in this study. Evidence-based DCM was adapted to the telemonitor platform by programming questions and educational information on depression symptoms, antidepressant adherence, and side effects. Recruited patients participated for a minimum of 3 weeks. Telehealth nurses were trained on DCM and received biweekly supervision. On-site trained research assistants conducted in-home research interviews on depression diagnosis and severity and patient satisfaction with the protocol. Results: An ethnically diverse sample of 48 English- and Spanish-only-speaking patients participated, along with seven telehealth nurses. Both patients and telehealth nurses reported high levels of protocol acceptance. Among 19 patients meeting diagnostic criteria for major depression, the mean depression severity was in the "markedly severe" range at baseline and in the "mild" range at follow-up. Conclusions: Results of this pilot support the feasibility of using homecare's existing telemonitoring technology to deliver DCM to their elderly homebound patients. This was true for both English- and Spanish-speaking patients. Preliminary clinical outcomes suggest improvement in depression severity, although these findings require testing in a randomized clinical trial. Implications for the science and service of telehealth-based depression care for elderly patients are discussed.  Copyright 2011, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2011. EID: 2-s2.0-80053250021
23. **Automated depression screening in disadvantaged pregnant women in an urban obstetric clinic**
Objective: A promising means of screening for depression among high-risk perinatal women involves interactive voice response (IVR) technology in which patients self-enter data into a database using a touch tone telephone. Our aim was to test the feasibility of using IVR to screen for depression among low-income, urban pregnant patients and to solicit their preferences for treatment. Methods: The study population included a convenience sample of English-speaking pregnant patients awaiting routine prenatal visits in an urban obstetric clinic. Consenting subjects used a phone in a private clinic room to complete an IVR version of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Patients scoring in the "not depressed" range were branched to a closing message while those with mild to severe depressive symptoms were branched to additional automated questions about their **treatment** preferences. Results: All 54 participants who consented to the study were able to complete the IVR phone session. More than 90% expressed willingness to complete IVR interviews as part of routine prenatal and postpartum care. Sixteen out of 54 participants (29.6%) scored in the moderate to severe range for depressive symptoms (EPDS  12) which was consistent with a prior study in the same population using a validated paper-pencil screen. Only 12 out of 21 (57%) depressed subjects indicated a desire to speak with a health care provider about how they are feeling. The majority of these depressed subjects preferred to speak with a social worker about housing or financial problems (92%) or an obstetrician or midwife (83%), while a minority (42%) wanted to speak with a mental health professional. Conclusions: This pilot study suggests that it is feasible to use an automated phone interview to screen for depression in low-income, urban pregnant women.  2007 Springer-Verlag.

24. **Comparing in-person to videoconference-based cognitive behavioral therapy for mood and anxiety disorders: Randomized controlled trial**
Background: Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) has demonstrated efficacy and effectiveness for treating mood and anxiety disorders. Dissemination of CBT via videoconference may help improve access to treatment. Objective: The present study aimed to compare the effectiveness of CBT administered via videoconference to in-person therapy for a mixed diagnostic cohort. Methods: A total of 26 primarily Caucasian clients (mean age 30 years, SD 11) who had a primary Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition text revision (DSM-IV-TR) diagnosis of a mood or anxiety disorder were randomly assigned to receive 12 sessions of CBT either in-person or via videoconference. Treatment involved individualized CBT formulations specific to the presenting diagnosis; all sessions were provided by the same therapist. Participants were recruited through a university clinic. Symptoms of depression, anxiety, stress, and quality of life were assessed using questionnaires before, after, and 6 weeks following treatment. Secondary outcomes at posttreatment included working alliance and client satisfaction. Results: Retention was similar across **treatment** conditions; there was one more client in the videoconferencing condition at posttreatment and at follow-up. Statistical analysis using multilevel mixed effects linear regression indicated a significant reduction in client symptoms across time for symptoms of depression (P<.001, d=1.41), anxiety (P<.001, d=1.14), stress (P<.001, d=1.81), and quality of life (P<.001, d=1.17). There were no significant differences between **treatment** conditions regarding symptoms of depression (P=.165, d=0.37), anxiety (P=.41, d=0.22), stress (P=.15, d=0.38), or quality of life (P=.62, d=0.13). There were no significant differences in client rating of the working alliance (P=.53, one-tailed, d=-0.26), therapist ratings of the working alliance (P=.60, one-tailed, d=0.23), or client ratings of satisfaction (P=.77, one-tailed, d=-0.12). Fisher's Exact P was not significant regarding differences in reliable change from pre- to posttreatment or from pretreatment to follow-up for symptoms of depression (P=.41, P=.26), anxiety (P=.60, P=.99), or quality of life (P=.65, P=.99) but was significant for symptoms of stress in favor of the videoconferencing condition (P=.03, P=.035). Difference between conditions regarding clinically significant change was also not observed from pre- to posttreatment or from pretreatment to follow-up for symptoms of depression (P=.67, P=.30), anxiety (P=.99, P=.99), stress (P=.19, P=.13), or quality of life (P=.99, P=.62). Conclusions: The findings of this **controlled** trial indicate that CBT was effective in significantly reducing symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress and increasing quality of life in both in-person and videoconferencing conditions, with no significant differences being observed between the two.

25. **A randomized controlled trial of telephone-delivered cognitive-behavioral therapy for late-life anxiety disorders**
OBJECTIVES: Older adults face a number of barriers to receiving psychotherapy, such as a lack of transportation and access to providers. One way to overcome such barriers is to provide **treatment** by telephone. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of **cognitive** **behavioral** therapy delivered by telephone (CBT-T) to older adults diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. DESIGN: Randomized **controlled** trial. SETTING: Participants' homes. PARTICIPANTS: Sixty participants age 60 and older with a diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, or anxiety disorder not otherwise specified. INTERVENTION: CBT-T versus information-only comparison. MEASUREMENTS: Coprimary outcomes included worry (Penn State Worry Questionnaire) and general anxiety (State Trait Anxiety Inventory). Secondary outcomes included clinician-rated anxiety (Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale), anxiety sensitivity (Anxiety Sensitivity Index), depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory), quality of life (SF-36), and sleep (Insomnia Severity Index). Assessments were completed prior to randomization, immediately upon completion of treatment, and 6 months after completing treatment. RESULTS: CBT-T was superior to information-only in reducing general anxiety (ES = 0.71), worry (ES = 0.61), anxiety sensitivity (ES = 0.85), and insomnia (ES = 0.82) at the posttreatment assessment; however, only the reductions in worry were maintained by the 6-month follow-up assessment (ES = 0.80). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that CBT-T may be efficacious in reducing anxiety and worry in older adults, but additional sessions may be needed to maintain these effects.  2012 American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry.

26. **Telemedicine for depression: A systematic review**
PURPOSE. More than 14% of the population has a mood disorder, and more than 50% do not receive treatment. Information and communication technology (ICT) could improve health care. A systematic review was considered in order to know the programs that apply ICT in the management of depression and to assess their effectiveness. CONCLUSION. There is insufficient scientific evidence regarding the effectiveness of ICT use in the management of depression. However, there is a well-founded hypothesis that videoconference produces the same results as face-to-face **treatment** and that self-help Internet programs could improve symptoms. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS. More research is needed; nevertheless, when traditional care is not possible, telemedicine could be used.  2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. EID: 2-s2.0-77954357632
27. **Design and implementation of the Telemedicine-Enhanced Antidepressant Management Study**
Objective: Evidence-based practices designed for large urban clinics are not necessarily transportable into small rural practices. Implementing collaborative care for depression in small rural primary care clinics presents unique challenges because it is typically not feasible to employ on-site mental health specialists. The purpose of the Telemedicine-Enhanced Antidepressant Management (TEAM) study was to evaluate a collaborative care model adapted for small rural clinics using telemedicine technologies. The purpose of this paper is to describe the TEAM study design. Method: The TEAM study was conducted in small rural Veterans Administration community-based outpatient clinics with interactive video equipment available for mental health, but no on-site psychiatrists/psychologists. The study attempted to enroll all patients whose depression could be appropriately treated in primary care. Results: The clinical characteristics of the 395 study participants differed significantly from most previous trials of collaborative care. At baseline, 41% were already receiving primary care depression treatment. Study participants averaged 5.5 chronic physical health illnesses and 56.5% had a comorbid anxiety disorder. Over half (57.2%) reported that pain impaired their functioning extremely or quite a bit. Conclusions: Despite small patient populations in rural clinics, enough patients with depression can be successfully enrolled to evaluate telemedicine-based collaborative care.  2006 Elsevier Inc.

28. **Feasibility and acceptability of clinic-based telepsychiatry for low-income hispanic primary care patients**
Background: The feasibility and acceptability of telepsychiatry for low-income Hispanic patients with major depression were assessed. Subjects and Methods: In total, 167 adult Hispanic patients with major depression recruited from a community health center (CHC) were randomly assigned to receive psychiatry services through a video Webcam (WEB) (n=80) or to **treatment** as usual (TAU) (n=87). The WEB condition consisted of monthly telepsychiatry sessions at the CHC for 6 months provided by one of two Hispanic psychiatrists using an online virtual meeting program. TAU patients received their care from their providers. Acceptability was assessed by comparing appointment keeping for primary care versus telepsychiatry, patients' perceived working alliance with their provider, visit satisfaction, and antidepressant use. Feasibility was assessed using depression outcomes, functional days (unproductive or days lost), and whether WEB and TAU patients differed in their appointment keeping. Results: WEB patients did not differ in the proportion of completed primary care versus telepsychiatry appointments and rated their working alliance with the psychiatrist and their visit satisfaction significantly higher than the TAU patients with their provider. Significantly more WEB than TAU patients used antidepressants. Although depression severity decreased faster among WEB than TAU patients, no differences were found in the overall depression score. WEB and TAU patients did not differ in the number of days that were lost or unproductive due to depression. Although WEB and TAU patients reported being willing to pay for mental health services provided by the CHC, almost proportionately twice as many WEB patients were willing to pay for telepsychiatry. Conclusions: Results show that for low-income depressed Hispanic patients, telepsychiatry service for depression is acceptable, although its feasibility is questionable. The benefits of telemedicine were discussed in terms of improving patient care in ways other than directly providing services to the patients.  Copyright 2012, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

29. **Relationships Among Depressive Symptoms, Benefit-Finding, Optimism, and Positive Affect in Multiple Sclerosis Patients After Psychotherapy for Depression**
Objective: While many patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) experience psychological problems, such as depression, benefit-finding is commonly reported. Using the Broaden-and-Build Model of positive emotions (Fredrickson, 2001) and the Expectancy-Value Model of optimism (Carver & Scheier, 1998) as two related, yet, distinct conceptual frameworks, this study examined positive affect and optimism as mediators of the relationship between improved depression and enhanced benefit-finding. Design: MS patients (N = 127), who participated in a larger, randomized clinical trial comparing two types of telephone psychotherapy for depression, were assessed at baseline, midtherapy (8 weeks), end of therapy (16 weeks), and 6- and 12-month posttherapy. Main Outcome Measures: Depression was measured with a telephone administered version of the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression; Positive Affect was measured with the Positive Affect Subscale from the Positive and Negative Affect Scale; Optimism was measured with the Life Orientation Test-Revised; Benefit-Finding was measured with the revised version of the Stress-Related Growth Scale. Results: Data were analyzed with multilevel random-effects models, controlling for time since MS diagnosis and type of treatment. Improved depression was associated with increased benefit-finding over time. The relationship between improved depression and benefit-finding was significantly mediated by both increased optimism and increased positive affect. Conclusion: Findings provide support to both theoretical models. Positivity appears to promote benefit-finding in MS.  2008 American Psychological Association. EID: 2-s2.0-43049091568
30. **A randomized trial of telemedicine-based collaborative care for depression**
BACKGROUND: Evidence-based practices designed for large urban clinics are not necessarily portable into smaller isolated clinics. Implementing practice-based collaborative care for depression in smaller primary care clinics presents unique challenges because it is often not feasible to employ on-site psychiatrists. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the Telemedicine Enhanced Antidepressant Management (TEAM) study was to evaluate a telemedicine-based collaborative care model adapted for small clinics without on-site psychiatrists. DESIGN: Matched sites were randomized to the intervention or usual care. PARTICIPANTS: Small VA Community-based outpatient clinics with no on-site psychiatrists, but access to telepsychiatrists. In 2003-2004, 395 primary care patients with PHQ9 depression severity scores 12 were enrolled, and followed for 12 months. Patients with serious mental illness and current substance dependence were excluded. MEASURES: Medication adherence, **treatment** response, remission, health status, health-related quality of life, and **treatment** satisfaction. RESULTS: The sample comprised mostly elderly, white, males with substantial physical and **behavioral** health comorbidity. At baseline, subjects had moderate depression severity (Hopkins Symptom Checklist, SCL-20 = 1.8), 3.7 prior depression episodes, and 67% had received prior depression treatment. Multivariate analyses indicated that intervention patients were more likely to be adherent at both 6 (odds ratio [OR] = 2.1, p = .04) and 12 months (OR = 2.7, p = .01). Intervention patients were more likely to respond by 6 months (OR = 2.0, p = .02), and remit by 12 months (OR = 2.4, p = .02). Intervention patients reported larger gains in mental health status and health-related quality of life, and reported higher satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: Collaborative care can be successfully adapted for primary care clinics without on-site psychiatrists using telemedicine technologies.  2007 Society of General Internal Medicine.

31. **Stepping up: Predictors of stepping within an icbt stepped-care intervention for depression**
Internet-based **cognitive** **behavioral** therapy (iCBT) may overcome barriers to mental health care and has proven efficacious. However, this approach currently exists outside the existing mental health care delivery system. Stepped care is a proposed framework for integrating digital mental health (DMH) into health systems by initiating iCBT and stepping up care to a more intensive intervention should iCBT prove ineffective. This study explores pre-treatment factors associated with reaching stepping criteria among patients receiving iCBT. This exploratory analysis of a stepped care arm of a larger randomized trial examined participants who were stepped to a more intensive intervention if they did not respond to iCBT. The association of pre-treatment factors on stepping were examined using KruskalWallis and Chi-square tests. One-fifth of the 151 participants met criteria for stepping within the 20-week **treatment** period. Only pre-treatment depression severity and **treatment** preference were associated with increased likelihood of stepping (p = 0.049 and 0.048, respectively). The low number of individuals who stepped provides support for iCBT as an effective, low intensity **treatment** for depression. The modest association of pre-treatment depression and preference to not receive iCBT may be useful in identifying patients who are less likely to respond.  2019 by the authors.

32. **Findings from a trial of the smartphone and online usage-based evaluation for depression (SOLVD) application: What do apps really tell us about patients with depression? concordance between app-generated data and standard psychiatric questionnaires for depression and anxiety**
Objective: Depression imposes a notable societal burden, with limited **treatment** success despite multiple available psychotherapy and medications choices. Potential reasons may include the heterogeneity of depression diagnoses and the presence of comorbid anxiety symptoms. Despite technological advances and the introduction of many mobile phone applications (apps) claiming to relieve depression,major gaps in knowledge still exist regarding what apps truly measure and how they correlate with psychometric questionnaires. The goal of this study was to evaluate whether mobile daily mood self-ratings may be useful in monitoring and classifying depression symptoms in a clinically depressed population compared with standard psychometric instruments including the Patient Health Questionaire-9 (PHQ-9), the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D), and the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A). Method: For this study, 22 patients with major depressive disorder with or without comorbid anxiety disorder were recruited. The diagnosis of depression was confirmed through the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). Over an 8-week period, daily moods were selfreported through the Smartphone and OnLine Usage-based eValuation for Depression (SOLVD) application, a custom-designed application that was downloaded onto patients' mobile devices. Depression and anxiety symptoms were also measured biweekly using the HAM-D, HAM-A, and PHQ-9. Results: Significant correlations were observed among self-evaluated mood, daily steps taken, SMS (text) frequency, average call duration, and biweekly psychometric scores (|r| > 0.5, P <0.05). The correlation coefficients were higher in individuals with more severe depressive symptoms. Conclusions: Although this study, given its limited sample size, was exploratory in nature, it helps fill a significant gap in our knowledge of the concordance between ratings obtained on the Ham-D, Ham-A, and the PHQ-9 psychometric instruments and data obtained via a smartphone app. These questionnaires represent goldstandard, commonly used psychiatric research/ clinical instruments, and, thus, this information can serve as a foundation for digital phenotyping for depression and pave the way for interventional studies using smartphone applications.

33. **Evaluating the use of a computerized CBT program for outpatients on a waitlist in a university CBT unit**
Objectives and Design: The goal of this pilot randomized **controlled** trial was to determine whether a computerized cognitive-behavioral therapy (cCBT) program for depression and anxiety could reduce symptoms in outpatients on a waitlist for face-to-face CBT for a variety of mental health complaints. Methods: Sixty-seven outpatients referred for CBT for disparate problems (eg, anxiety, depression, obsessions or compulsions) were randomized to 1 of 2 conditions: (1) the cCBT program "Good Days Ahead," which included weekly guidance and support, or (2) a **control** condition where patients were referred to a freely available online CBT workbook. Measures of psychological distress were administered at the start of study and at the end of the waiting period, when participants were formally diagnosed and assessed for face-to-face therapy. Results: For the most part, mixed-design analyses of variances revealed no statistically significant changes in symptom measures over time. Nonsignificant interactions and modest effect sizes between groups across time suggest that the cCBT group did not do better than the **control** group. The majority of cCBT participants reported that the program was "very" or "extremely useful," while only a portion of the **control** group felt the same about the workbook. There were notable differences in the completion rates of the 2 groups in favor of the cCBT program. Conclusions: Offering a general cCBT program to waiting list patients may not confer an advantage over referring them to an online workbook, at least in terms of symptom reduction. Results could be partly explained by difficulties translating knowledge into practice, especially if participants' main problem was not directly addressed by the intervention.

34. **Examining the effectiveness of a web-based intervention for symptoms of depression and anxiety in college students: Study protocol of a randomised controlled trial**
Introduction The college years are a peak period for the onset of common mental disorders. Poor mental health is associated with low academic attainment, physical, interpersonal and **cognitive** impairments. Universities can use online approaches to screen students for mental disorders and **treat** those in need. The present study aims to assess the effectiveness of a guided web-based transdiagnostic individually tailored intervention to **treat** students with symptoms of depression and/or anxiety. Methods and analysis The present study is a randomised **controlled** trial. Participants are Dutch college students (18 years) with mild to moderate depression and/or anxiety symptoms. The intervention is a guided web-based transdiagnostic individually tailored intervention that targets symptoms of depression and/or anxiety. The intervention consists of seven online sessions with a duration ranging from 4 to 7 weeks depending on individual progress. A booster session is administered 4 weeks after the completion of the seventh session. Primary outcome measures are the Patient Health Questionnaire for depression and the Generalised Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale for anxiety. These scales are administered at screening, post-treatment and follow-up assessments (6 and 12 months post-randomisation). Ethics and dissemination The Medical Ethics Committee of the Vrije Universiteit Medical Centre has approved the protocol (registration number 2016.583, A2017.362andA2018.421).

Introduction Telepsychiatry is defined as the use of information and communication technology (ICT) in providing remote psychiatric services. Telepsychiatry is applied using two types of communication: synchronous (real time) and asynchronous (store and forward). Objective To determine the cost-effectiveness of a synchronous and an asynchronous telepsychiatric model in prison inmate patients with symptoms of depression. Methods A cost-effectiveness study was performed on a population consisting of 157patients from the Establecimiento Penitenciario y Carcelario de Mediana Seguridad de Manizales, Colombia. The sample was determined by applying Zung self-administered surveys for depression (1965) and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), the latter being the tool used for the comparison. Results Initial Hamilton score, arrival time, duration of system downtime, and clinical effectiveness variables had normal distributions (P>.05). There were significant differences (P<.001) between care costs for the different models, showing that the mean **cost** of the asynchronous model is less than synchronous model, and making the asynchronous model more cost-effective. Conclusions The asynchronous model is the most cost-effective model of telepsychiatry care for patients with depression admitted to a detention centre, according to the results of clinical effectiveness, **cost** measurement, and **patient** satisfaction.  2016 Asociacin Colombiana de Psiquiatra EID: 2-s2.0-84973590686
1. **Asynchronous Telepsychiatry: A Component of Stepped Integrated Care**
Objective: Integrated behavioral healthcare models typically involve a range of consultation options for mental healthcare. Asynchronous telepsychiatry (ATP) consults may be an additional potential choice, so we are conducting a 5-year clinical trial comparing ATP with synchronous telepsychiatry (STP) consultations. Methods: Patients referred by primary care providers are randomly assigned to one of the two treatment groups, ATP or STP. Clinical outcome, satisfaction, and economic data are being collected from patients for 2 years at 6-month intervals. Results: Baseline characteristics for the first 158 patients and case examples of ATP are presented. Conclusion: Implementing ATP in existing integrated behavioral healthcare models could make mental healthcare more efficient.  Copyright 2018, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. EID: 2-s2.0-85046971165
2. **PsychVACS: A system for asynchronous telepsychiatry**
Objective: To describe the technical development of an asynchronous telepsychiatry application, the Psychiatric Video Archiving and Communication System. Methods: A client-server application was developed in Visual Basic.Net with Microsoft SQL database as the backend. It includes the capability of storing video-recorded psychiatric interviews and manages the workflow of the system with automated messaging. Results: Psychiatric Video Archiving and Communication System has been used to conduct the first ever series of asynchronous telepsychiatry consultations worldwide. A review of the software application and the process as part of this project has led to a number of improvements that are being implemented in the next version, which is being written in Java. Conclusions: This is the first description of the use of **video** recorded data in an asynchronous telemedicine application. Primary care providers and consulting psychiatrists have found it easy to work with and a valuable resource to increase the availability of psychiatric consultation in remote rural locations.  2011, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

3. **Disruptive innovation: The future of healthcare?**
The traditional face-to-face doctor-patient relationship is the core of conventional medical practice. One key aspect of this changing relationship is the increasing dependency on asynchronous data collection in clinical consultations. Such electronic communications and data streams may be numeric, text-based, audio, digitized still pictures, **video** and radiologic, as well as emanating from multiple medical devices. While asynchronous medicine may be established in specialties like radiology and dermatology, there is little research regarding the use of asynchronous medicine in areas of medicine that traditionally rely on the physical doctor-patient interaction such as primary care, internal medicine, geriatrics, and psychiatry. The practice of psychiatry stands out as a discipline that is highly dependent on the quality of the physical meeting between the doctor and the patient, yet even in this specialty it is possible to utilize asynchronous medicine for some types of psychiatric consultations. Asynchronous medicine has the potential to be significantly disruptive to our current healthcare processes, as well as more clinically and economically efficient.

4. **Cost analysis of store-and-forward telepsychiatry as a consultation model for primary care**
Store-and-forward telepsychiatry, or asynchronous telepsychiatry (ATP), which allows clinical data, including **video** to be collected to be reviewed at a later time by a specialist, has been described as a feasible alternative to real-time telepsychiatry, or synchronous telepsychiatry (STP), as a consultation model for primary care. In theory, ATP should be economically more cost-effective than STP due to the increased flexibility of **patient** data collection and the substitution of the time of specialists with that of lower-cost providers. The aim of this study was to conduct a retrospective cost-analysis comparing ATP with STP and traditional in-person psychiatric consultations in the primary care setting. One hundred and twenty five ATP consultations were performed and fixed and marginal costs were calculated for each model using inputs such as equipment costs, time spent by providers and support staff, and hourly salaries. The fixed costs were $7,000 and $20,000 for ATP and STP and marginal costs were $68.18, $107.50, and $96.36, respectively, for the three groups. STP was the most expensive of the three types of consultations. ATP became the most cost-effective of the three models beyond 249 consultations. The marginal **cost** savings of ATP were due to substitution of low-cost providers for specialists. ATP represents a potential disruptive healthcare process that could allow more affordable care to be delivered to a larger population of patients. A full accounting of ATP's efficiency will require further studies, including prospective cost-benefit analyses from the perspectives of the patient, provider, and society.  2012 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

0. **Advances in cognitive-behavioral therapy for youth with anxiety disorders: A brief summary**
Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has burgeoned as the leader in psychosocial treatments for anxious children and adolescents. Despite the established efficacy of CBT for **youth** with anxiety, there is a disparity amongst individuals and families in need of services, and accessibility to qualified practitioners who can effectively deliver empirically supported treatments. Additionally, a substantial number of children either do not respond at all to CBT or do not achieve sustained improvement. As a result, recent research in the area of childhood anxiety disorders focuses on extending treatment delivery of CBT to families who may not have direct access to trained clinicians, and expanding treatment to **youth** with comorbid conditions and treatment non-responders. This paper provides a preferably brief overview of research on advancements in the delivery of cognitive-behavioral therapy for anxious youth, discusses practical considerations, and highlights the current state of intervention research in this area. Specifically, the goals of this literature review are to consider innovative adaptations of CBT for anxious **youth** in the last decade with a particular focus on: (a) computer and Internet-delivered interventions and clinician training platforms; (b) the potential of videoteleconferencing service delivery methods; (c) treatment personalization via modular interventions targeting individual strengths and addressing responsivity to treatment; and, (d) transdiagnostic approaches for **youth** with anxiety and comorbid disorders. Barriers and implications for future research and interventions are discussed.  2016 Bentham Science Publishers. EID: 2-s2.0-84960128433
1. **Translating Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Anxious Youth to Rural-Community Settings via Tele-Psychiatry**
This study aimed to determine the feasibility of translating **cognitive** behavioral therapy for anxious **youth** to rural-community settings via tele-psychiatry training. A 20-week group-supervision training program was delivered to ten different groups from different agencies within Northern Ontario. Each group consisted of four to nine clinicians with **child** therapy background not specific to CBT (n=78, 51% social workers, 49% other mental health disciplines). Clinicians were each required to treat an anxious **youth** under supervision. Changes in clinician knowledge and **youth** internalizing symptoms were measured. Northern Ontario clinicians showed significant gains on a **child** CBT-related knowledge test (t<inf>(1, 52)</inf>=4.6, p<.001). Although **youth** treated by these clinicians showed a significant decrease in anxiety symptoms, possible response bias and the lack of a comparison group mandate further studies before generalizing our findings. Nevertheless, training local therapists in anxiety-focused CBT for children via a group supervision based tele-psychiatry model appears to be a feasible and well-received approach to knowledge translation to rural settings.  2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

2. **Generic versus disorder specific cognitive behavior therapy for socialanxiety disorder in youth: A randomized controlled trial usinginternet delivery**
The study examined whether the efficacy of **cognitive** behavioral treatment for Social Anxiety Disorder for children and adolescents is increased if intervention addresses specific **cognitive** and behavioral factors linked to the development and maintenance of SAD in young people, over and above the traditional generic CBT approach. Participants were 125 youth, aged 817 years, with a primary diagnosis of SAD, who were randomly assigned to generic CBT (CBT-GEN), social anxiety specific CBT (CBT-SAD) or a wait list control (WLC). Intervention was delivered using a therapist-supported online program. After 12-weeks, participants who received treatment (CBT-SAD or CBT-GEN) showed significantly greater reduction in social anxiety and post-event processing, and greater improvement in global functioning than the WLC but there was no significant difference between CBT-SAD and CBT-GEN on any outcome variable at 12-weeks or 6-month follow-up. Despite significant reductions in anxiety, the majority in both treatment conditions continued to meet diagnostic criteria for SAD at 6-month follow-up. Decreases in social anxiety were associated with decreases in post-event processing. Future research should continue to investigate disorder-specific interventions for SAD in young people, drawing on evidence regarding causal or maintaining factors, in order to enhance treatment outcomes for this debilitating condition.  2016 Elsevier Ltd EID: 2-s2.0-85006141751
3. **The SmartCAT: An m-health platform for ecological momentary intervention in child anxiety treatment**
Introduction: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for **child** anxiety, although efficacious, typically requires 16-20 weekly sessions with a therapist. Brief CBT (BCBT; eight sessions) for **child** anxiety is promising but may have less favorable outcomes owing to reduced session time. Mobile health (m-health) has the potential to improve BCBT efficacy by delivering ecological momentary intervention to engage **youth** in learning and practicing CBT skills in their everyday lives (in vivo). Materials and Methods: We developed an m-health platform entitled SmartCAT (Smartphone-enhanced Child Anxiety Treatment). SmartCAT consists of (1) a smartphone application (app) that cues **youth** to use the CBT skills taught in sessions, (2) an online portal that allows therapists to monitor skill use, to send cues and treatment-related materials, to engage **youth** in real-time via secure messages, and to manage rewards, and (3) a communication protocol that allows real-time bidirectional exchange between the app and the portal. A pilot study with nine **youth** (9-14 years old) examined the platform's feasibility as an adjunct to BCBT. Results: SmartCAT was found to be capable of supporting BCBT for **child** anxiety and received positive feedback from both therapists and **youth** patients. Patients rated the app as highly usable (mean=1.7 on a 1-7 scale, with 1="easy"). Patients completed 5.36 skills coach entries per session (standard deviation=1.95) and took an average of 3.14 min (standard deviation=0.98 min) to complete the entries. Conclusions: A smartphone app is feasible within CBT for **child** anxiety. Users found SmartCAT both acceptable and easy to use. Integrating an m-health platform within BCBT for anxious children may facilitate involvement in treatment and dissemination of effective procedures. Copyright  2014, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

0. **Guided Internet-Based Self-Help Intervention for Social Anxiety Disorder With Videoconferenced Therapist Support**
We describe the development of a novel, Internet-based, self-help intervention for social anxiety disorder (SAD) in adults, and report data on the preliminary efficacy of the program when administered with minimal therapist support delivered via a common videoconferencing platform. Participants (n=13) completed the intervention, which consists of 8 weekly modules and a brief weekly videoconferenced check-in with a therapist. The intervention program is derived from an acceptance-based CBT program that utilizes traditional behavioral interventions (e.g., exposure) within the context of a model emphasizing mindful awareness and psychological acceptance of distressing subjective experiences. Assessments revealed that participants experienced a significant reduction in SAD symptoms and improvements in psychosocial functioning, and that treatment gains were maintained over a 3-month follow-up period. The effect sizes for the main outcome measures were large to very large (d=0.90 to 1.47), and comparable to other Internet-based treatment programs as well as in-person trials for SAD (e.g., Feske & Chambless, 1995; Tulbure, 2011). Participants also rated the treatment program as highly acceptable. This pilot study provides preliminary evidence that an Internet-based intervention grounded in basic behavioral and acceptance-based principles is effective for the treatment of SAD, and that videoconferenced therapist support may be useful in enhancing treatment compliance. Implications and future directions are discussed.  2016 EID: 2-s2.0-84944097655
1. **Treatment of Social Anxiety Disorder Using Online Virtual Environments in Second Life**
Over 80% of people with social anxiety disorder (SAD) do not receive any type of treatment, despite the existence of effective evidence-based treatments. Barriers to treatment include lack of trained therapists (particularly in nonmetropolitan areas), logistical difficulties (e.g., cost, time, transportation), concerns regarding social stigma, and fear of negative evaluation from health care providers. Interventions conducted through electronic communication media, such as the Internet, have the potential to reach individuals who otherwise would not have access to evidence-based treatments. Second Life is an online virtual world that holds great promise in the widespread delivery of evidence-based treatments. We assessed the feasibility, acceptability, and initial efficacy of an acceptance-based **behavior** therapy in Second Life to treat adults with generalized SAD. Participants (n= 14) received 12 sessions of weekly therapy and were assessed at pretreatment, midtreatment, posttreatment, and follow-up. Participants and therapists rated the treatment program as acceptable and feasible, despite frequently encountered technical difficulties. Analyses showed significant pretreatment to follow-up improvements in social anxiety symptoms, depression, disability, and quality of life, with effect sizes comparable to previously published results of studies delivering in-person cognitive **behavior** therapy for SAD. Implications and future directions are discussed.  2012. EID: 2-s2.0-84872289268
2. **Acceptance based behavior therapy for social anxiety disorder through videoconferencing**
Most individuals with social anxiety disorder (SAD) do not receive any type of treatment. Reasons include logistical barriers (e.g., geographic location, travel time), fear of stigmatization, and fear of the social interactions associated with seeking treatment. Videoconferencing technology holds great promise in the widespread delivery of evidence-based treatments to those who would otherwise not receive treatment. This pilot study assessed the feasibility, acceptability, and initial efficacy of an acceptance-based behavioral intervention using Skype videoconferencing to treat adults with generalized SAD. Twenty-four participants received 12 sessions of weekly therapy and were assessed at pre-treatment, mid-treatment, post-treatment, and 3-month follow-up. Participants and therapists rated the intervention as acceptable and feasible. Analyses revealed significant pre-treatment to follow-up improvements in social anxiety, depression, disability, quality of life, and experiential avoidance, with effect sizes comparable to or larger than previously published results of studies delivering in-person CBT for SAD. Implications and future directions are discussed.  2013 Elsevier Ltd. EID: 2-s2.0-84879799248

0. **Predicting engagement with an online psychosocial intervention for psychosis: Exploring individual- and intervention-level predictors**
Background: Individuals with psychosis demonstrate positive attitudes towards utilising digital technology in mental health treatment. Although preliminary research suggests digital interventions are feasible and acceptable in this population, little is known about how to best promote engagement with these resources. Candidate predictors include therapist support, sources of motivation and recovery style. Understanding what factors predict engagement will aid more effective **design** and implementation of digital interventions to improve clinical benefits. Objective: This study aimed to investigate demographic, psychological, and treatment variables that predict overall and type of engagement with a psychosocial, online intervention for individuals with psychosis. Methods: Ninety-eight participants with a history of psychosis were given access to a web program containing modules on self-management and recovery, which they were asked to use flexibly at their own pace. Activity was automatically logged by the system. Baseline measures of demographics, recovery style and motivation were administered, and participants were randomised to receive either website access alone, or website access plus weekly, asynchronous emails from an online coach over 12 weeks. Log and baseline assessment data were used in negative binomial regressions to examine predictors of depth and breadth of use over the intervention period. A logistic regression was used to examine the impact of predictor variables on usage profiles (active or passive). Results: Depth and breadth of engagement were positively predicted by receiving email support, low levels of externally controlled motivations for website use, older age, and having a tertiary education. There was a significant interaction between level of controlled motivation and condition (+/email) on breadth and depth of engagement: receiving asynchronous emails was associated with increased engagement for individuals with low, but not high, levels of externally controlled motivations. Receiving email support and more autonomous motivations for treatment predicted more active use of the website. Conclusions: Asynchronous email support can promote engagement with online interventions for individuals with psychosis, potentially enabling self-management of illness and improving clinical outcomes. However, those using online interventions due to external motivating factors, may have low levels of engagement with the intervention, irrespective of coaching provided. These findings may guide **design** and implementation of future online interventions in this population.  2019 The Authors EID: 2-s2.0-85070855127
1. **A self-guided relaxation module for telepsychiatric services: Development, usefulness, and feasibility**
Objective: A modified form of the standard autogenic relaxation exercise was developed as part of a telepsychiatry project, which aims to deliver mental healthcare to remote areas through the net, and through the agency of non-specialists. This study describes the development and evaluation of a brief and simpler form of a relaxation technique, the Self-Guided Relaxation (SGR). Method: SGR is a systematic technique to focus on muscle groups and feel the heaviness and relaxation through suggestions to induce relaxation in the body. The SGR was taught to 37 patients with different psychiatric disorders over two sessions a week apart. Measures of change used were scores on the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) and a visual analog scale. Its usefulness and feasibility was examined over a follow-up period of one month. Additionally a group of non-specialists was trained in SGR supplemented by audiovisual aids and printed instructions. These therapists rated the ease in learning and administering SGR in patients. Results: There was a consistent reduction in the HAM-A scores over the follow-up period among patients. Improvements were also noted in positive experiences, adherence, depth of relaxation achieved, perceived benefit, and patient satisfaction. Majority of the patients, relatives, and therapists reported that they could administer or practice SGR after having learned the technique in a single session lasting about 30 minutes. The use of audio-video aids and manual was helpful in making the process of learning easy. Conclusions: Preliminary findings of usefulness, feasibility, and acceptance of the SGR were encouraging. These findings pave way for larger, randomized controlled study and for testing applicability of the SGR as a net-based psychological intervention.  2013, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.

2. **Usability of online psychoeducation for siblings of people with psychosis**
Objectives: The E Sibling Project aims to address the needs of siblings of individuals affected by psychosis through provision of a comprehensive online intervention. The online intervention comprises four core elements, including: information on psychosis; various coping and promoting well-being strategies; siblings' blogs and discussion forum with peers; and an Ask the Experts function. After the intervention-prototype was developed, we tested its feasibility, usability and acceptability by siblings. Methods: We evaluated the usability of the intervention-prototype using a non-randomised usability study with siblings of individuals diagnosed with psychosis. The usability study adapted Poulson et al's framework to collect subjective feedback from participants on ease of use, perceived usefulness and acceptability, together with objective usage data on the intervention. Results: Twenty siblings were recruited to the usability test; 19 tried out the resource-prototype over a 4-week period and 17 completed the online evaluation after using the intervention. In total, 906 page-views were made by the participants and each spent about two hours using the resource. Participants evaluated the intervention as helpful, relevant and useful in terms of content, **design** and usability. Developments are needed to improve the navigation and intuitiveness of the resource. Conclusions: Using an internet-based information-giving and peer support intervention to promote wellbeing and coping is feasible and acceptable to siblings of people with psychosis.

3. **Process of design and usability evaluation of a telepsychology web and virtual reality system for the elderly: Butler**
Butler is a multi-application **system** based on Internet technology and virtual reality, designed to meet the needs of elderly users. Its objectives are to assist elderly populations in accessing technology and new forms of communication, replicating, as far as possible the way of lineal interaction that this population group had traditionally to interact with information in order to facilitate the first contacts with technology. Butler is equipped with e-mail, videoconferencing, blogging, access to the Internet through a well-known web search engine, image and sound gallery, new contacts searcher, and two virtual reality environments. In this paper we describe Butler's most relevant features taking into account the usability **design** process and the usability evaluation of the system, which, after pilot testing, have proven to be highly acceptable and satisfactory to users. We also present the results of evaluations pertaining to the iconography used in the program, the navigation and users' help **design** process, and the first functional prototype, all of which were designed and redesigned with the aid of web heuristics and guidelines for the web **design** for elderly users. Results suggest important features to be taken into account when designing and developing this sort of application for the elderly.  2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. EID: 2-s2.0-84871818019
4. **An e-health platform for the elderly population: The butler system**
The Butler **system** is an e-health platform designed to improve the elderly population's quality of life. The Butler **system** has three applications diagnostic, therapeutic and playful. The objective of this work is to present the influence of the use of the platform on elderly users' mood states and the degree of acceptance. These measures were assessed through visual analogical scales before and after the platform use, with the outcome measures MANOVAS analyses were performed. Seventeen users (from 58 to 79 years old) completed four sessions with the system; they could choose which technological resources they used in each session. The results showed that after using the system, the participants' insensitive emotions increased and their negative ones decreased. In addition, they obtained high levels of satisfaction, low levels of subjective difficulty and would recommend Butler to other users. Therefore, the results indicate that Butler might be an effective **system** for improving emotional states in elderly population.  2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. EID: 2-s2.0-77957994043

0. **Self-management intervention for head and neck cancer couples: Results of a randomized pilot trial**
Background: Patients with head and neck **cancer** (HNC) experience significant physical and psychological morbidity during radiotherapy (RT) that contributes to treatment interruptions and a poor quality of life. Although spouses/partners can help by encouraging patient self-management (eg, self-care) during RT, they often experience high psychological distress rates, lack basic **health** care knowledge and skills, and report increased marital conflict regarding patient self-management. The current pilot study examined the feasibility and acceptability of a 6-session telephone-based intervention called Spouses coping with the Head And neck Radiation Experience (SHARE), which teaches self-management, communication, and coping skills to patients with HNC and their spouses. The treatment effects of SHARE compared with usual medical care (UMC) in controlling patient physical symptoms and improving patient/spouse psychological and marital functioning also were examined. Methods: Thirty patients who initiated RT and their spouses (60 participants; 40% of whom were racial/ethnic minorities) were randomized to SHARE or UMC, and preintervention and postintervention assessments were completed. Results: Solid recruitment (70%) and low attrition rates (7%) demonstrated feasibility. Strong program evaluations and homework completion rates (72%) supported acceptability. Significant treatment effects (medium in magnitude) were observed for SHARE compared with UMC with regard to HNC-specific physical symptom burden (Cohens d, -0.89) and symptom interference (Cohens d, -0.86). Medium to large effects favoring SHARE also were found for patient and spouse depressive symptoms (Cohens d, -0.84) and cancer-specific distress (Cohens d, -1.05). Conclusions: The findings of the current study **support** the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of SHARE. They also suggest that programs that empower HNC couples with the necessary skills to coordinate care and manage the challenges of RT together hold great promise for controlling a patients physical symptoms and improving the psychological functioning of both partners.  2018 American Cancer Society EID: 2-s2.0-85058017264
1. **Reducing disparity in outcomes for immigrants with cancer: A qualitative assessment of the feasibility and acceptability of a culturally targeted telephone-based supportive care intervention**
Purpose: Australia has one of the most culturally diverse populations in the world. Immigrant **cancer** patients' poorer outcomes compared to English-speaking patients confirm the need for culturally sensitive supportive care interventions. The aims of this study were (1) to identify cultural sensitivities that are important to the acceptability of a telephone-based supportive care intervention and (2) to identify cultural barriers and facilitators to intervention participation. Methods: Patients and carers attending Chinese or Arabic **cancer** **support** groups were recruited. Two focus groups comprising 12 patients and 4 carers, and two telephone interviews were conducted in the participants' own language. A semi-structured interview format was utilised to determine potential cultural sensitivities that may influence the intervention delivery format as well as patients' willingness to participate in telephone-based supportive care interventions. Content analysis confirmed similar themes across groups. Results: The intervention was viewed favourably as a means of providing information and **support** in the patient's language. Cultural considerations included assurances of confidentiality, as **cancer** is not openly discussed within communities. An initial face-to-face contact was highlighted as the most important factor facilitating participation. Participants also recommended the inclusion of patient-initiated calls as part of the intervention. Conclusions: This study provides cultural insights relevant to the development of a culturally sensitive telephone-based supportive care intervention for Arabic- and Chinese-speaking **cancer** patients. Participants highlighted the need for face-to-face contact and inclusion of patient-initiated calls as important methodological considerations.  2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

2. **A new Australian online and phone mental health support service for Young People Living With Cancer**
Objective: The purpose of CanTeen's E-Mental Health Service for Young People Living With Cancer (YPLWC) is to meet the unique psychosocial needs of **young** people (12-24 years) in Australia impacted by **cancer** (either as a patient or family member of someone with cancer). Conclusions: This online platform will provide the primary site where all YPLWC can find information, connect with others going through a similar experience, express their feelings, utilise tools for **support** and access professional psychosocial **support** services that will meet their individual needs. The overall outcome of the service will be to ensure that the YPLWC visiting the site experience optimal psychological wellbeing. Ultimately, the service's value will be in improving the lives of **young** people who engage with it and the follow-on effect that this will have on their families and communities in the long-term.

3. **'SMS' for mental health - Feasibility and acceptability of using text messages for mental health promotion among young women from urban low income settings in India**
Objective: The current study assesses the acceptability and feasibility of mobile text messages for promoting positive **mental** **health** and as a helpline among **young** women in urban slums of Bangalore. Methodology: Forty girls in the age range of 16-18 years from urban slums received messages every day for a month. They could call or message back or give a 'missed call' to the same number whenever they had emotional problems or felt like talking to a counselor. The received responses in the form of return texts, missed calls and return **phone** calls were recorded. Feedback about the feasibility and acceptability of the mobile messages was collected after a month. Results: 25 out of 40 (62.5%) participants called back, asking for **mental** **health** services and to say they felt good about the messages. 23 of 40 (57.5%) messaged back regarding their feelings. 62% reported that they felt supported with the **mental** **health** messages. Male family members of nearly half of the participants called back to check the authenticity of the source. Most women did not face any problems because of the messages. Conclusion: This pilot qualitative study indicates that mobile text messages are a feasible and culturally acceptable method for **mental** **health** promotion and prevention among **young** women from urban slums in India. Issues such as consent from the woman and family, ensuring confidentiality and providing authentic and reliable **support** services, need to be taken into account before attempting to scale up such a service, particularly in vulnerable groups.  2014 Elsevier B.V.

4. **A qualitative study of young people's perspectives on receiving psychiatric services via televideo**
Objective: It is critical to consult **young** people about their experiences. This study addresses the paucity of research on the perspective of **young** people in general, and in paediatric telepsychiatry specifically. The goal is to understand the experience of **young** people receiving telepsychiatry. Method: Interpretive interactionism (Denzin, 1989) was used to interview 30 **young** people; immediately following the consultation and four to six weeks later. Analysis occurred via a series of steps in keeping with the interpretive interactionist framework. Results: Four themes arose repeatedly: the encounter with the psychiatrist and experience of having others in the room; the helpfulness of the session; a sense of personal choice during the consultation; and, the technology. Participants highlighted the importance of their relationship with the psychiatrist. Participant's narratives were replete with examples of ways that they actively took responsibility and exerted **control** within the session itself. Conclusion: Young people have a significant role to play in their own care. It is critical that telepsychiatry recommendations be explained and opportunities for **young** people to express their concerns and discuss alternatives are provided. Further efforts to include **young** people may include ensuring offering alternate treatments and/or negotiated when recommended treatments are unacceptable and/or resisted. EID: 2-s2.0-77949602145
5. **Applying mobile technologies to mental health service delivery in South Asia**
Mobile phones have increasingly assumed an important role in the treatment of **mental** disorders in high-income countries. This paper considers such possibilities in the South Asian context. First, a brief review of mobile **phone** use in **mental** disorders is provided. Next, data on the market penetration and dissemination of mobile phones in South Asia is presented. Finally, common barriers to treatment for **mental** disorders in South Asia are evaluated against solutions that could be derived from mobile technologies. Though not without their risks, mobile phones have the potential to increase engagement, treatment, and retention of South Asian patients with **mental** disorders in unprecedented ways.  2012 Elsevier B.V.

6. **The Utility of Videoconferencing to Provide Innovative Delivery of Psychological Treatment for Rural Cancer Patients: Results of a Pilot Study**
The unmet psychological needs of rural **cancer** patients are numerous. Telepsychology is a novel and feasible option that may provide cost-savings and help overcome inequalities in access to specialists. This is the first known study of psychological treatment for people with **cancer** delivered entirely via videoconferencing. We hypothesized that a telepsychology service would improve rural **cancer** patients' anxiety and depression levels and quality of life, and would be an acceptable, satisfactory, and practical mode of service delivery. Twenty-five **cancer** patients attended an average of three sessions with a clinical psychologist providing brief cognitive-behavioral therapy. Questionnaires were completed at pre-, post-, and 1-month follow-up. Patients benefited in terms of anxiety (P = 0.01) and quality of life (P = 0.04). The service was both practical and acceptable. These preliminary positive results provide a firm basis to conduct a randomized **controlled** trial of face-to-face interaction vs. videoconferencing.  2006 U.S. Cancer Pain Relief Committee.

7. **Using tailored telephone counseling to accelerate the adoption of colorectal cancer screening**
Background: Few interventions to increase colorectal **cancer** screening have used a stage of change model to promote screening adoption. None have used computer-assisted tailored telephone counseling calls. This study's purpose was to implement and evaluate stage-based computer-assisted tailored telephone counseling to promote colorectal **cancer** screening in a primary care population. Methods: This randomized **controlled** trial used a two-stepped intervention that included a mailed booklet on colorectal **cancer** screening followed by computer-assisted telephone counseling that was based on the Precaution Adoption Process Model. Chart audit was used to document completion of colonoscopy, sigmoidoscopy or fecal occult blood testing. Results: Record audits were completed on 2474 (88%) of the 2817 eligible participants. There was no significant difference in the frequency and nature of the screening tests completed in the study arms. In a sub-analysis, stages of adoption were evaluated pre- and post-telephone counseling. Over half those receiving counseling reported a change in stage towards screening adoption. Conclusion: Overall, the intervention did not increase colorectal screening compared to control. Two possible reasons for the absence of a screening effect include: (a) the focus of the protocol on education for most patients rather than motivation, and (b) the requirement that patients interested in screening seek further information and a referral on their own from their providers. While those receiving telephone counseling improved their stage of adoption, we cannot rule out selection bias. Stronger physician recommendation to speak with the counselors could improve call acceptance. Future colorectal screening should address these weaknesses.  2007. EID: 2-s2.0-34547830870
8. **A mobile phone program to track young people's experiences of mood, stress and coping**
Background: Research examining adolescent mood, stresses, and coping has tended to use retrospective questionnaires which are affected by recall biases. The aim of this study was to develop, pilot, and evaluate a youth-friendly mobile **phone** program to monitor, in real-time, **young** people's everyday experiences of mood, stress, and their coping behaviours. Method and design: A momentary sampling program was designed for mobile phones, and ran for 7 days, administering a brief questionnaire four random times each day, capturing information on current activity, mood, responses to negative mood, stresses, alcohol and cannabis use. Eleven high school students reviewed the program in focus groups, and 18 students completed 7 days of monitoring. Results: Engagement with the mobile type program was high with 76% of 504 possible entries completed and 94% (17/18) of the participants reporting that the program adequately captured their moods, thoughts, and activities. The mobiletype program captured meaningful and analyzable data on the way **young** people's moods, stresses, coping strategies, and alcohol and cannabis use, vary both between and within individuals. Conclusions: The mobile type program captured a range of detailed and interesting qualitative and quantitative data about **young** people's everyday mood, stresses, responses, and general functioning.

9. **Perspectives of Young Adults on Receiving Telepsychiatry Services in an Urban Early Intervention Program for First-Episode Psychosis: A Cross-Sectional, Descriptive Survey Study**
Background: Limited knowledge exists on telepsychiatry in specialized services for first-episode psychosis (FEP), despite its potential for improving service access and engagement. Objective: To explore access and use of technology, obstacles to attending clinic appointments, and perspectives of **young** adults with FEP on using telepsychiatry as part of outpatient services. Methods: A cross-sectional, descriptive survey study was conducted between July and October 2017 with **young** adults between the ages of 18 and 38 recruited from a specialized program for FEP in an urban Canadian setting. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and content analysis. Results: Among 51 participants (mean age = 26.1, SD = 4.2; 59% male; 20% experiencing housing instability), more than half (59%, n = 30) rarely or never used mainstream video chat (e.g., Facetime). The majority (78%, n = 40) reported obstacles to attending appointments, with several (37%, n = 19) identifying two or more. Almost half (49%, n = 25) were very favorable towards telepsychiatry and a quarter (25%, n = 13) were somewhat favorable. Participants expressed several concerns about telepsychiatry, including loss of human contact and confidentiality. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is a first study on the perspectives of individuals with FEP about telepsychiatry. Despite experiencing obstacles to attending appointments and expressing receptivity towards telepsychiatry, participants did not have access to these services. It is important to provide education to clinicians on the potential of telepsychiatry to improve service access. Also, more research is needed on when, where, and how telepsychiatry can be integrated into existing care while addressing patient and clinician concerns.

Aim: To examine heterogeneity in outcome at 12 months following 8 weeks of **treatment** for smoking cessation with bupropion sustained-release (SR) 150 or 300 mg/day combined with behavioural counselling. Design, setting, participants: Smokers were recruited from a large healthcare system and then randomized to receive either bupropion SR 150 mg/day (n = 763) or 300 mg/day (n = 761) taken for 8 weeks in combination with either proactive telephone counselling or a tailored mail approach. Measurements and findings: A comprehensive set of relevant individual pretreatment and **treatment** characteristics was included in the analysis. Smoking outcome at 12 months was defined as point-prevalence of any regular self-reported smoking within the 7 days prior to follow-up contact. Classification and **regression** tree analysis identified subgroups that varied with respect to likelihood of being nonsmokers at 12 months. Seven subgroups were identified among those receiving bupropion SR 150 mg/day (proportion of nonsmokers at 12 months ranged from 13.7% to 43.5%) and eight subgroups among those receiving bupropion SR 300 mg/day (proportion of nonsmokers at 12 months ranged from 9.6% to 51.7%). In the 150-mg/day group, those with the lowest rate reported no previous quit attempt of 1 month or more in duration while those with the highest rate all reported previous quit attempts of 1 month or longer. In the 300 mg/day group, those with the lowest rate had very **high** levels of dependence while those with the highest rate were more highly educated and smoked at a lower level. Across all subgroups, cost per 12-month quitter ranged from a low of $US302 to a **high** of $US2502. Conclusions: These results indicate the presence of a substantial amount of variation in outcome following **treatment** with both dosages of bupropion SR, with substantial cost consequences. Variation in outcome could be reduced by providing treatments tailored to subgroups of individuals who are at exceptionally **high** risk for smoking following a quit attempt.  2008 Adis Data Information BV.

1. **Psychosocial Outcomes of Telephone-Based Counseling for Adults With an Acquired Physical Disability: A Meta-Analysis**
Background: The delivery of mental health services by telephone, referred to as telecounseling, has the potential to improve the health outcomes of adults with an acquired physical disability in a cost-effective way. However, the efficacy of this form of **treatment** requires further evaluation before it is used on a larger scale. Aim: This meta-analysis provides a critical and quantitative evaluation of the impact of telephone-administered psychological interventions on the psychosocial functioning of adults with an acquired physical disability caused by spinal cord injury, limb amputation, severe burn injury, stroke, or multiple sclerosis. Method: A comprehensive search of eight electronic databases identified eight studies (N = 658 participants) that compared **treatment** efficacy to that of matched control groups. Differences in the psychosocial outcomes of **treatment** and control participants were examined using Cohen's d effect sizes. Fail-safe Ns and 95% confidence intervals were used to evaluate the significance of these results. Results: Significant improvements in coping skills and strategies (overall d = 0.57), community integration (overall d = 0.45), and depression (overall d = 0.44) were observed immediately after telecounseling, with modest improvements in quality of life maintained at 12 months post-intervention (overall d = 0.37). Conclusions: The results suggest that telecounseling is an effective **treatment** modality for adults adjusting to a physical disability; however, further trials are needed to establish the long term psychosocial benefits.  2011 American Psychological Association.

2. **Identification of the hikikomori syndrome of social withdrawal: Psychosocial features and treatment preferences in four countries**
Background: Hikikomori, a form of social withdrawal first reported in Japan, may exist globally but cross-national studies of cases of hikikomori are lacking. Aims: To identify individuals with hikikomori in multiple countries and describe features of the condition. Method: Participants were recruited from sites in India, Japan, Korea and the United States. Hikikomori was defined as a 6-month or longer period of spending almost all time at home and avoiding social situations and social relationships, associated with significant distress/impairment. Additional measures included the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Loneliness Scale, Lubben Social Network Scale (LSNS-6), Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) and modified Cornell Treatment Preferences Index. Results: A total of 36 participants with hikikomori were identified, with cases detected in all four countries. These individuals had **high** levels of loneliness (UCLA Loneliness Scale M = 55.4, SD = 10.5), limited social networks (LSNS-6 M = 9.7, SD = 5.5) and moderate functional impairment (SDS M = 16.5, SD = 7.9). Of them 28 (78%) desired **treatment** for their social withdrawal, with a significantly higher preference for psychotherapy over pharmacotherapy, in-person over telepsychiatry **treatment** and mental health specialists over primary care providers. Across countries, participants with hikikomori had similar generally **treatment** preferences and psychosocial features. Conclusion: Hikikomori exists cross-nationally and can be assessed with a standardized assessment tool. Individuals with hikikomori have substantial psychosocial impairment and disability, and some may desire treatment.  2014 The Author(s). EID: 2-s2.0-84921878511

0. **A model for digital mental healthcare: Its usefulness and potential for service delivery in low- and middle-income countries**
Background: Using digital technology to deliver mental **health** care can possibly serve as a viable adjunct or alternative to mainstream services in lessening the mental **health** gap in a large number of resource deficient and LAMI countries. Conventional models of telepsychiatric services available so far, however, have been inadequate and ineffective, as these address only a small component of care, and rely on engagement of specialists who are grossly insufficient in numbers. Aim: To describe an innovative digital model of mental **health** care, enabling and empowering the non-specialists to deliver **high** quality mental **health** care in remote areas. Methods: The model is powered by an online, fully automated clinical decision **support** system (CDSS), with interlinked modules for diagnosis, management and follow-up, usable by non-specialists after brief training and minimal supervision by psychiatrist, to deliver mental **health** care at remote sites. Results: The CDSS has been found to be highly reliable, feasible, with sufficient sensitivity and specificity. This paper describes the model and initial experience with the digital mental **health** care system deployed in three geographically difficult and remote areas in northern hill states in India. The online system was found to be reasonably comprehensive, brief, feasible, user-friendly, with **high** levels of patient satisfaction. 2594 patients assessed at the three remote sites and the nodal center represented varied diagnoses. Conclusions: The digital model described here has the potential to serve as an effective alternative or adjunct for delivering comprehensive and **high** quality mental **health** care in LAMI countries like India in the primary and secondary care settings.  2019 Indian Journal of Psychiatry.

1. **The opportunity for telehealth to support neurological health care**
Neurological conditions affect one-third of Americans and are some of the most prevalent **health** issues in the country. Many sufferers have difficulty accessing treatment, however, advances in technology may be able to **support** availability, affordability, and convenience of care through telehealth services. This review outlines the **current** state of telemedicine in neurological healthcare, highlighting evidence-based research and use cases for digital services. Details on expenses associated with managing certain well-known conditions are included to shed light on the financial burden of disease and how telehealth can contribute to cost savings for patients and providers. Finally, a discussion of **current** telehealth legislature gives additional perspective on regulatory dynamics experienced by different stakeholders in the field. Research supports telemedicine as a solution to enhance **current** care models given its many benefits, including efficient and clinically useful service delivery. This movement has the opportunity to help billions of individuals globally by acting as a mechanism to provide impactful and scalable neurological healthcare.

2. **Digitising psychiatry? Sociotechnical expectations, performative nominalism and biomedical virtue in (digital) psychiatric praxis**
Digital artefacts and infrastructures have been presented as ever more urgent and necessary for mental **health** research and practice. Telepsychiatry, mHealth, and now digital psychiatry have been promoted in this regard, among other endeavours. Smartphone apps have formed a particular focus of promissory statements regarding the improvement of epistemic and clinical work in psychiatry. This article contextualises and historicises some of these developments. In doing so, I show how purportedly novel fields have been constituted in part through practices of performative nominalism (whereby articulations of a neologism in relation to established and recent developments participate in producing the referent of the new term). Central to this has been implicit and explicit extolment of what I term biomedical virtues in public-facing and professionally orientated discourse. I document how emphases on various virtues have shifted with the attention of psychiatry to different digital modalities, culminating with knowledge-production in mental **health** as one significant focus.  2018 The Author.

Telemental health, which involves clinicians connecting remotely to patients via teleconferencing, has seen growing interest. In addition to providing in-home treatment, this technology allows specialists to provide care in remote and underserved areas. Current research suggests that both patients and clinicians are satisfied with telemental **health** services and that it is comparable in terms of quality to in-person care. Nonetheless, concerns still exist regarding its effects on the role of clinicians and the care they provide.  2016,  The Author(s) 2016. EID: 2-s2.0-84959422131
4. **From Digital Mental Health Interventions to Digital Addiction: Where the Two Fields Converge**
Scientific literature from the last two decades indicates that, when it comes to mental health, technology is presented either as panacea or anathema. This is partly because researchers, too frequently, have planted themselves either in the field of digital mental **health** interventions (variably called telepsychiatry, digital therapeutics, computerized therapy, etc.), or in that of the problems arising from technology, with little cross-fertilization between the two. Yet, a closer look at the two fields reveals unifying themes that underpin both the advantages and dangers of technology in mental health. This article discusses five such themes. First, the breakneck pace of technology evolution keeps digital mental **health** interventions updated and creates more potentially problematic activities, leaving researchers perennially behind, so new technologies become outdated by the time they are studied. Second, the freedom of creating and using technologies in a regulatory vacuum has led to proliferation and choice, but also to a Wild-West online environment. Third, technology is an open window to access information, but also to compromise privacy, with serious implications for online psychology and digital mental **health** interventions. Fourth, weak bonds characterize online interactions, including those between therapists and patients, contributing to **high** attrition from digital interventions. Finally, economic analyses of technology-enabled care may show good value for money, but often fail to capture the true costs of technology, a fact that is mirrored in other online activities. The article ends with a call for collaborations between two interrelated fields that have beentill nowmutually insular.  Copyright  2020 Aboujaoude and Gega. EID: 2-s2.0-85079160741
5. **The Digital Revolution in Behavioral Health**
BACKGROUND: Technology is disrupting every modern industry, from supermarkets to car manufacturing, and is now entering the **health** care space. Technological innovations in psychiatry include the opportunity for conducting therapy via two-way video conferencing, providing electronic consultations, and telementoring and education of community **health** care providers. Use of mobile **health** applications is also an expanding area of interest and promise. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this article is to review the evolution and pros and cons of technology-enabled **health** care since the digital movement in psychiatry began more than 50 years ago as well as describe the University of Rochesters innovative digital **behavioral** **health** care model. METHODS: A review of the literature and recent reports on innovations in digital **behavioral** **health** care was conducted, along with a review of the University of Rochesters model to describe the **current** state of digital **behavioral** **health** care. RESULTS: Given the lack of access to care and mental **health** professional shortages in many parts of the United States, particularly rural areas, digital **behavioral** **health** care will be an increasingly important strategy for managing mental **health** care needs. However, there are numerous hurdles to be overcome in adopting digital **health** care, including provider resistance and knowledge gaps, lack of reimbursement parity, restrictive credentialing and privileging, and overregulation at both the state and federal levels. CONCLUSIONS: Digital **health** innovations are transforming the delivery of mental **health** care services and psychiatric mental **health** nurses can be on the forefront of this important digital revolution.

0. **Psychosis 101: Evaluating a training programme for northern and remote youth mental health service providers**
Background: Most of the early psychosis intervention (EPI) training has focused on family physicians participants. In Northern Ontario, there is a shortage of primary care. This paper will present evaluation results of a pilot training programme for rural and remote youth **mental** **health** service providers. Method: A mixed methods **approach** was used. We evaluated a 2-day workshop about EPI for non-medical **mental** **health** workers delivered onsite and simultaneously by videoconferencing. There were 19 participants across four agencies. Seven were onsite and 12 were offsite. Participants' knowledge was measured using a validated questionnaire at pre-intervention and at 3-, 6- and 9-month follow up. A repeated measures ANOVA was used to evaluate knowledge acquisition between the two modes of training. At 6 months, focus group interviews were conducted to explore their experiences of the mode of intervention delivery and evaluation. Emerging themes were iteratively derived through a series of discussions involving independent coders. Results: Only 15 complete datasets were available of the 19 original participants. Differences in knowledge acquisition between the two groups did not reach statistical difference. Six-month focus group data indicated that participants improved their relationship with EPI services and they were part of a strengthened network with other providers in the region. Post-intervention, the accuracy of referrals from participating agencies increased dramatically, with an increase in proportion of referrals who were eligible for EPI services. The follow-up process engaged participants in learning and re-engaged them with the material taught during the training session. Conclusions: The results about developing service partnerships and relationship with specialist services are encouraging for policy and service decision-makers to address **mental** **health** service needs in northern and remote areas.  2013 Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.

1. **Videoconferencing in a mental health service in The Netherlands: A randomized controlled trial on patient satisfaction and clinical outcomes for outpatients with severe mental illness**
Introduction: The goal of the study was to determinate if there was added value in the use of videoconferencing (VCF) in outpatient care for people with severe **mental** illness (SMI). Methods: A VCF-group was compared to a control group (care as usual) over a period of 18 months. Block randomization was used to assign patients to one of the two groups. The video communication was available to the patients on a 24/7 basis, so that emergency calls could also be made via VCF. The primary outcome was **patient** satisfaction, other outcomes were: quality of life, loneliness, daily functioning (psychologically and socially), and the fulfilment of needs of care. Eventually, 93 patients signed their informed consent and participated. Results: For the primary outcome a statistically significant time by treatment interaction effect was found, where higher degree of satisfaction was associated with the patients in the VCF-group. The secondary outcomes revealed no differences between the two groups. Despite the participants not using the VCF units extensively during the project, they were reasonably satisfied with VCF; on average, they rated the service with a 7.5 grade (on a scale from 110). Discussion: Although the study showed a positive result for **patient** satisfaction, overall the VCF seemed to have limited impact. So VCF might not offer much added value to care as usual. However, statistical power in this study dropped somewhat due to dropout. Furthermore, VCF usage was lower than expected. Assuming that VCF will be most effective if it is actually used, it seems likely that the actual effect-size reached in this study has been significantly lower than the anticipated effect-size. Finally, this study shows that VCF is a tool that can be used in the care for people with severe **mental** illness.  2016,  The Author(s) 2016. EID: 2-s2.0-85020199870
2. **A standard telemental health evaluation model: The time is now**
The telehealth field has advanced historic promises to improve access, cost, and quality of care. However, the extent to which it is delivering on its promises is unclear as the scientific evidence needed to justify success is still emerging. Many have identified the need to advance the scientific knowledge base to better quantify success. One method for advancing that knowledge base is a standard telemental **health** evaluation model. Telemental **health** is defined here as the provision of **mental** **health** services using live, interactive video-teleconferencing technology. Evaluation in the telemental **health** field largely consists of descriptive and small pilot studies, is often defined by the individual goals of the specific programs, and is typically focused on only one outcome. The field should adopt new evaluation methods that consider the co-adaptive interaction between users (patients and providers), healthcare costs and savings, and the rapid evolution in communication technologies. Acceptance of a standard evaluation model will improve perceptions of telemental **health** as an established field, promote development of a sounder empirical base, promote interagency collaboration, and provide a **framework** for more multidisciplinary research that integrates measuring the impact of the technology and the overall healthcare aspect. We suggest that consideration of a standard model is timely given where telemental **health** is at in terms of its stage of scientific progress. We will broadly recommend some elements of what such a standard evaluation model might include for telemental **health** and suggest a way forward for adopting such a model.

3. **Psychological online consultation service attracts men: A new approach to close the gap between being ill and being treated**
Background: Since 1999, the University Hospital Zurich (Zurich, Switzerland) has offered an e-mail-based consultation service for individual **health** concerns where anonymous questions can be asked to an online doctor. This study aimed at the characterization of the user profile, the content of the question, and the answers given specific in the field of psychiatry. Materials and Methods: In total, 3,148 questions were asked from 2008 to 2010. Of these, 209 (6.6%) requests were selected by International Classification of Diseases-10 and International Classification of Primary Care codes relevant for psychiatry and included in the retrospective qualitative study. The content analysis of the requests was supported by means of the Mayring inductive category system using a professional text analysis program (MAXQDA). Results: Of the users, 45.9% were female, and 46.9% were male. The mean age was 37.4 years. The main topics of the request were somatoform, somatization, and hypochondriac disorders in 18.4%, behavioral syndromes in 17.9%, and mood disorders in 15.4%. The reason stated most frequently for using the service was looking for a second opinion. The doctors responded with detailed information about disease and treatment and in 70.8% recommended consultation of a physician. Conclusions: Telemedicine is suggested to empower patients by developing **health** literacy with professional advice. The gender ratio of the users is almost equal, although the prevalence of psychological diseases in the general population is higher in women than in men. Psychological online consultation may potentially reach mentally ill individuals who do not have or did not seek professional help yet, and it seems to be especially attractive for men.  2015, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

4. **Coping, productive time use, and negative mood among adults with severe mental illness: A daily diary study**
Most studies on coping among persons with severe **mental** illness have relied on retrospective self-report methods; a limitation of this methodology is susceptibility to recall bias. The purpose of the present investigation was to expand the current understanding of the impact of coping among persons with severe **mental** illness by examining coping strategies, mood, and social functioning (operationalized as productive time use) using a daily process design. Twenty-seven adults diagnosed with severe **mental** illness completed baseline clinical interviews and up to 20 days of nightly telephone interviews addressing coping and daily life. A total of 198 coping efforts were reported for 387 days. Mixed-effects regression analyses examined the association between type of daily coping strategy (problem-centered, neutral, or avoidant) and both daily proportion of time participants spent in productive activity and daily negative mood, controlling for demographic and clinical variables. The results indicated that productive time use was significantly lower on days when avoidant strategies were used, in contrast with days when problem-centered strategies and neutral strategies were used. There was no significant main effect of coping on negative mood, although there was a trend in the expected direction. Findings support the hypothesis that the types of coping strategies adults with severe **mental** illness use are related to better social functioning on a daily level.  2010 Elsevier B.V.

5. **'CHEATS': A generic information communication technology (ICT) evaluation framework**
This paper describes a generic **framework** for the evaluation of information communication technologies. This framework, CHEATS, utilises both qualitative and quantitative research methods and has proved appropriate in multiple clinical settings including telepsychiatry, teledermatology and teleeducation. The paper demonstrates how a multidisciplinary **approach** is essential when evaluating new and emerging technologies, particularly when such systems are implemented in real service as opposed to a research setting.  2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

6. **Towards a Framework for Evaluating Mobile Mental Health Apps**
Introduction: Mobile phones are ubiquitous in society and owned by a majority of psychiatric patients, including those with severe **mental** illness. Their versatility as a platform can extend **mental** **health** services in the areas of communication, self-monitoring, self-management, diagnosis, and treatment. However, the efficacy and reliability of publicly available applications (apps) have yet to be demonstrated. Numerous articles have noted the need for rigorous evaluation of the efficacy and clinical utility of smartphone apps, which are largely unregulated. Professional clinical organizations do not provide guidelines for evaluating mobile apps. Materials and Methods: Guidelines and frameworks are needed to evaluate medical apps. Numerous frameworks and evaluation criteria exist from the engineering and informatics literature, as well as interdisciplinary organizations in similar fields such as telemedicine and healthcare informatics. Results: We propose criteria for both patients and providers to use in assessing not just smartphone apps, but also wearable devices and smartwatch apps for **mental** health. Apps can be evaluated by their usefulness, usability, and integration and infrastructure. Apps can be categorized by their usability in one or more stages of a **mental** **health** provider's workflow. Conclusions: Ultimately, leadership is needed to develop a **framework** for describing apps, and guidelines are needed for both patients and **mental** **health** providers.

7. **Feasibility of popular m-health technologies for activity tracking among individuals with serious mental Illness**
Obesity prevalence is nearly double among individuals with serious **mental** illness (SMI), including schizophrenia spectrum disorders, bipolar disorder, or major depressive disorder, compared with the general population. Emerging mobile **health** (m-health) technologies are increasingly available and offer the potential to support lifestyle interventions targeting weight loss, yet the practical feasibility of using these technologies in this high-risk group has not been established. We evaluated the feasibility and acceptability of popular m-health technologies for activity tracking among overweight and obese individuals with SMI. We provided wearable activity monitoring devices (FitBit [San Francisco, CA] Zip or Nike Inc. [Beaverton, OR] FuelBand) and smartphones (Apple [Cupertino, CA] iPhone 4S) for accessing the smartphone application for each device to participants with SMI enrolled in a weight loss program. Feasibility of these devices was measured by the frequency of use over time. Acceptability was measured through qualitative follow-up interviews with participants. Ten participants with SMI wore the devices for a mean of 89% (standard deviation=13%) of the days in the study. Five participants wore the devices 100% of the time. Participants reported high satisfaction, stating the devices were easy to use, helpful for setting goals, motivational, and useful for self-monitoring. Several participants liked the social connectivity feature of the devices where they could see each other's progress on the smartphone application, noting that "friendly" competition increased motivation to be more physically active. This study supports using popular m-health technologies for activity tracking among individuals with SMI. These findings can inform the design of weight loss interventions targeting this vulnerable **patient** population.  Copyright 2015, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2015. EID: 2-s2.0-84924815083

0. **Telepsychiatry services for Korean immigrants**
Asian Americans often face **cultural** and language barriers when obtaining mental health treatment. With the small number of Asian mental health providers, it is difficult to ensure the linguistic and ethnic matching of providers and patients. Telepsychiatry holds great promise to address the unique needs of Asian Americans. We developed a project to establish telepsychiatry services that connect Korean mental health patients in Georgia with a linguistically and culturally competent psychiatrist in California and assessed the **level** of acceptability of psychiatric treatment via real-time teleconferencing among these patients. Upon the completion of the program, 16 patients (5 men, 11 women) completed a questionnaire that measured their acceptability of the telepsychiatry service. The findings indicate a high **level** of acceptance of the program among Korean patients. The quantitative and qualitative data show that they especially appreciated the **cultural** sensitivity of the consultation and the comfortable interaction with the provider. However, challenges such as technical issues of teleconferencing may negatively affect the quality of the clinical interaction. Our study expands the knowledge base regarding the acceptability of such services to a population that experiences disparities in mental health care. Future research should extend telepsychiatry services to other Asian population groups that experience lower access to mental health services.  2012, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. EID: 2-s2.0-84871264338
1. **Acceptability of telepsychiatry in American Indians**
Telepsychiatry differs from in-person treatment in terms of its delivery mechanism, and this dissimilarity may increase **cultural** differences between the provider and the patient. Because **cultural** competence and identification can impact **patient** satisfaction ratings, we wanted to explore whether **cultural** differences in our study population influenced telepsychiatric and in-person interviews. Here, we compared the acceptability of conducting psychiatric assessments with rural American Indian veterans by real-time videoconferencing versus inperson administration. The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IIIR (SCID) was given to participants both in person and by telehealth. A process measure was created to assess participants' responses to the interview type concerning the usability of the technology, the perceptions of the interviewee/interviewer interaction, the **cultural** competence of the interview, and satisfaction with the interview and the interview process. The process measure was administered to 53 American Indian Vietnam veterans both in-person and by real-time interactive videoconferencing. Mean responses were compared for each participant. Interviewers were also asked several of the same questions as the participants; answers were compared to the corresponding participant responses. Overall, telepsychiatry was well received and comparable in **level** of **patient** comfort, satisfaction, and **cultural** acceptance to in-person interviews. We also found evidence to suggest that interviewers sometimes interpreted participant satisfaction as significantly less favorable than the participants actually responded. Despite the potential of videoconferencing to increase **cultural** differences, we found that it is an acceptable means for psychiatric assessment of American Indian veterans and presents an opportunity to provide mental health services to a population that might otherwise not have access.

2. **Telepsychiatry and cultural barrier in Korea**
This research was performed in order to empirically prove that telepsychiatry can result in overcoming of the Confucian **cultural** barrier which discouraged Korean patients from seeking psychiatric care. The Confucian culture of Korea forces its members to observe absolute conformity to the social norm. In this kind of culture it is very hard to admit one's mental illness and to seek medical help. Thus telepsychiatry might be a good alternative to face-to-face meeting-based psychiatry especially in culturally inhibitive places such as Korea. We conducted a telepsychiatry experiment using Instant Messenger with 93 volunteers who had an experience of seeing a psychiatrist in person. The result shows that people tend to think that telepsychiatry allowed them to break out of the Confucian **cultural** protocol which put heavy emphasis on avoiding any irregular thought.

0. **Telepsychiatry Consultation for Medical and Surgical Inpatient Units**
Background Telepsychiatry is becoming more commonplace in the provision of psychiatric care. Most commonly used in the outpatient setting, there is little information available in the literature as to the use of telepsychiatry for inpatient medical/surgical consultation. Objective We review the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center's telepsychiatry **consultation** program that provides **consultation** to an outlying community-based **rural** hospital. Methods This article examines the 69 telepsychiatry consultations that were performed from November 2014 through February 2016, looking at the patients served, common **consultation** questions, and patterns of diagnoses and recommendations. Results The median age of individuals undergoing telepsychiatry evaluations was 67 years, and the most common reason for **consultation** was for delirium. Over half of the patients consulted had a primary diagnosis of delirium, dementia, or a cognitive disorder not otherwise specified, using Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition, Text Revision) diagnoses. In most patients, additional laboratory studies or imaging or both were requested and medication changes recommended (initiation, dose changes, and discontinuation). Conclusion This report provides one of the first detailed views of the use of telepsychiatry in a remote inpatient medical setting. Findings will guide education to primary teams and will shape the development of future telepsychiatry interventions.  2018 The Academy of Psychosomatic Medicine. EID: 2-s2.0-85029228744
1. **Telepsychiatry for Inpatient Consultations at a Separate Campus of an Academic Medical Center**
Background: Many hospitals do not have regular access to psychiatry **consult** services. This is well understood as a common shortage at nonacademic community hospitals (especially in **rural** environments, and may also be a problem at noncontiguously located smaller hospitals that are affiliated with academic medical centers in urban settings. The authors sought to deliver timely inpatient psychiatric consultation-liaison services via telemedicine to a local but physically separated **hospital** affiliated with an academic medical center. Materials and Methods: The authors collaborated with an office dedicated to the advancement of telemedicine technology at their academic medical center. They developed a telemedicine-based care model to deliver inpatient consultation-liaison psychiatry consultations to an affiliated (but physically separate) small academic **hospital** that did not have its own on-site consultation-liaison psychiatry team. Results: The authors were able to successfully complete 30 consultations, each within 24 h. Only 1 patient was ultimately unwilling to participate in the telemedicine interview. As consultations were accomplished on same day as request, patient length of stay was unaffected. Conclusions: This pilot study suggests that telemedicine is a viable model for inpatient consultation-liaison psychiatry services to hospitals without on-site psychiatry resources and represents a viable alternative model of service delivery.  2016, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2016.

2. **Expansion of the consultation-liaison psychiatry paradigm at a university medical center: Integration of diversified clinical and funding models**
The perspective of the contemporary Consultation-Liason Service (CLS) psychiatrist is increasingly one of consultant to medical and surgical colleagues in models other than inpatient medical and surgical units. Simultaneously, the need for a clinically and educationally robust inpatient CLS persists despite funding pressures. The University of California, Davis Medical Center Department of Psychiatry has made use of creative organizational and financial models to accomplish the inpatient CLS clinical and educational missions in a fiscally responsible manner. In addition, the department has in recent years expanded the delivery of psychiatry consultation-liaison clinical and educational services to other models of care delivery, broadening the role and influence of the CLS. Several of the initiatives described in this paper parallel an overall evolution of the practice of consultation-liaison psychiatry in response to managed care influences and other systems pressures. This consultation-liaison paradigm expansion with diversified sources of funding support facilitates the development of consultation-liaison psychiatry along additional clinical, administrative, research, and educational dimensions. Other **university** medical centers may consider adaptation of some of the initiatives described here to their institutions.  2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. EID: 2-s2.0-0038013578
3. **Telepsychiatry "coverage" to a rural inpatient psychiatric unit**
Objective: Rural psychiatrists responsible for inpatient psychiatry units in general hospitals often have trouble getting coverage for training, vacations, and periods of illness. This article describes telepsychiatry "coverage" to a **rural** general **hospital** psychiatric unit for 1 week. Materials and Methods: All adult patients meeting criteria for inpatient mental health treatment in the emergency room were offered admission to the general **hospital** after obtaining informed consent regarding the use of inpatient telepsychiatry. The number of patients on the inpatient psychiatric unit ranged from three to nine, with an average daily census of seven. All psychiatric care was provided via video teleconferencing (VTC) at a bandwidth of 512 kilobits per second using Internet Protocol. Results: Patients with psychosis reported more difficulty hearing the doctor than patients without psychosis and incorporated VTC into delusions in a congruent manner. Patients rated development of rapport and effectiveness of treatment higher than **staff** ratings. Two **staff** thought telepsychiatry was either not effective for acutely psychotic patients or more effective with higher functioning patients. Conclusions: Short-term coverage of **rural** inpatient psychiatric units for purposes of vacation, training, and illness is possible using telepsychiatry. Psychiatrist's efficiency and consistency are enhanced with instantaneous connections possible from hospital, office, or home. Significant increases in **staff** workload will occur without remote access to electronic medical records, electronic physician ordering, and an adequate physical layout of the inpatient psychiatric unit. Adequate educational preparation of unit **staff** regarding telepsychiatry and a **staff** process group during implementation is recommended.  Copyright 2011, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2011.

4. **Telepsychiatry by a Public, Academic Medical Center for Inpatient Consults at an Unaffiliated, Community Hospital**
Background: Telepsychiatry has the potential to help address the uneven distribution of psychiatrists between urban and **rural** areas. While telepsychiatry has been used for several decades, employing video conferencing technologies to conduct psychiatry consults to the medical wards of **rural** hospitals is a more recent application. Objective: To **develop** the first US program wherein psychiatrists covering the **consult** service at a public, academic medical **center** also delivered same-day consults to patients on the medical wards of unaffiliated, **rural** hospitals. Methods: We describe the rationale, workflow, technology, case distribution, benefits, and lessons learned from the first 24 months of the service. Results: The program resulted in 156 initial and follow-up consults wherein patient interviews were conducted via live videoconference. An additional 19 curbside consults were done via hospitalist-to-psychiatrist phone calls. Though the initial impetus for the development of the program was to manage involuntarily-detained patients awaiting the availability of a psychiatric bed, the availability of the psychiatrists resulted in the service being used for a wide range of situations and diagnoses. Conclusion: Given the benefits noted by consultants, patients, and community **hospital** medical staff, the program could be replicated by other institutions.  2018 Academy of Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry EID: 2-s2.0-85059526970

Background: Evaluation of telepsychiatry (via videoconference) for older adults is mostly focussed on nursing homes or inpatients. We evaluated the role of a community based program for older adults in **rural** and remote regions of South Australia. Method: The utilization pattern was studied using retrospective chart review of telepsychiatry assessments over 24 months (2010-2011). Satisfaction was evaluated through prospective post-consultation feedback (using a 5-point Likert scale), from patients, community based clinicians and psychiatrist participating in consecutive assessments from April-November 2012. Descriptive analysis was used for the utilization. Mean scores and proportions were calculated for the feedback. Mann Whitney U test was used to compare **patient** subgroups based on age, gender, prior exposure to telepsychiatry services and inpatient/ outpatient status. Feedback comments were analysed for emerging themes. Results: On retrospective review of 134 consults, mean age was 75.89 years (SD 7.55), 60.4% (81) were females, and 71.6% (96) lived independently. Patients had a broad range of psychiatric disorders, from **mood** disorders to delirium and dementia, with co-morbid medical illness in 83.5% (112). On feedback evaluation (N = 98), mean scores ranged from 3.88-4.41 for patients, 4.36-4.73 for clinicians and 3.67-4.45 for psychiatrists. Feedback from inpatients (14 out of 37) was significantly lower compared to outpatients (37 out of 61) (chi sq. = 0.808, p < 0.05), and they were significantly less satisfied with the wait time (U = 163.0, p < 0.05) and visual clarity (U = 160.5, p < 0.05). Audio clarity was the most common aspect of dissatisfaction (mean score less than 3) among patients (6, 11%). Psychiatrists reported a preference for telepsychiatry over **face** to **face** in 55.4% (46) assessments. However, they expressed discomfort in situations of cognitive or sensory disabilities in patients. Conclusions: In **rural** and remote areas, community-based telepsychiatry program can be a useful adjunct for psychiatrist input in the care of older adults. Innovations to overcome sensory deficits and collaboration with community services should be explored to improve its acceptance among the most vulnerable population.  2018 The Author(s).

1. **Evaluation of a rural telepsychiatry service**
Objective: To evaluate a telepsychiatry clinical service to Wagga Wagga in **rural** New South Wales, comprising a face-to-face interview with a psychiatrist followed by a telepsychiatry interview with a Sydney-based psychiatrist. Methods: Thirty-one patients were referred to a specialist **mood** disorder clinic in a **rural** setting for consultation and assessment. A retrospective evaluation was made to determine the acceptance of the teleconferenced psychiatry and face-to-face psychiatry, as well as the overall **patient** response. Results: Twenty participants completed all evaluation components. Their results indicated a satisfaction level of 95% with the consultation process as a whole, with 80% happy to use telepsychiatry again and 60% preferring telepsychiatry over travelling to a larger centre for face-to-face consultation. The face-to-face component was satisfactory for 85% of patients while the telepsychiatry component was satisfactory for 72%. Conclusions: Although face-to-face psychiatry was preferred by this sample, the telepsychiatry component was highly rated and preferred over travel to larger centres for face-to-face consultation, by residents of **rural** and remote locations. Certain issues are of more concern in telepsychiatry than face-to-face psychiatry, including confidentiality, rapport, explanation and education. EID: 2-s2.0-4744354629
2. **Telepsychiatry in the Heartland: If we build it, will they come**
The quality of care provided by telemedicine and its acceptability to persons who live in **rural** areas is largely undetermined. In this study, service satisfaction and functional status in persons using telemedicine was compared to those receiving face-to-face services at two **rural** sites over a 2-year study period. Similar ratings of satisfaction and clinical status were observed in twelve patients who received services under both modalities. Although there are many obstacles to successful program implementation, telepsychiatry appears to offer an acceptable and adequate alternative mode of service delivery to persons who live in **rural** areas.

In corrections, where staffing limitations tax an overburdened **mental** **health** system, telemental **health** is an increasingly common mode of **mental** **health** service delivery. Although telemental **health** presents an efficient treatment modality for a spectrum of **mental** **health** services, it is imperative to study how this modality influences key elements of the treatment experience. In this study, the authors compared inmates' perceptions of the working alliance, postsession mood, and satisfaction with psychiatric and psychological **mental** **health** services delivered through 2 different modalities: telemental **health** and face-to-face. Participants consisted of 186 inmates who received **mental** **health** services (36 via telepsychology, 50 via face-to-face psychology, 50 via telepsychiatry, and 50 via face-to-face psychiatry). Results indicate no significant differences in inmates' perceptions of the work alliance with the **mental** **health** professional, postsession mood, or overall satisfaction with services when telemental **health** and face-to-face modalities were compared within each type of **mental** **health** service. Implications of these findings are presented.  2008 American Psychological Association. EID: 2-s2.0-38949111763

0. **An economic cost analysis of an expanding, multi-state behavioural telehealth intervention**
Introduction: In this paper the economic costs associated with a growing, multi-state telepsychiatry intervention serving rural American Indian/Alaska Native populations were compared to costs of travelling to provide/receive in-person treatment. Methods: Telepsychiatry costs were calculated using administrative, information-technology, equipment and technology components, and were compared to **travel** **cost** models. Both a patient **travel** and a psychiatrist **travel** model were estimated utilising ArcGIS software and unit costs gathered from literature and government sources. Cost structure and sensitivity analysis was also calculated by varying modeling parameters and assumptions. Results and Discussion: It is estimated that per-session costs were $93.90, $183.34, and $268.23 for telemedicine, provider-travel, and patient-travel, respectively. Restricting the analysis to satellite locations with a larger number of visits reduced telemedicine per-patient encounter costs (50 or more visits: $83.52; 100 or more visits: $80.41; and 150 or more visits: $76.25). The estimated **cost** efficiencies of telemedicine were more evident for highly rural communities. Finally, we found that a multi-state centre was cheaper than each state operating independently. Conclusions: Consistent with previous research, this study provides additional evidence of the economic efficiency associated with telemedicine interventions for rural American Indian/Alaska Native populations. Our results suggest that there are economies of scale in providing behavioural telemedicine and that bigger, multi-state telemedicine centres have lower overall costs compared to smaller, state-level centres. Additionally, results suggest that telemedicine structures with a higher number of per-satellite patient encounters have lower costs, and telemedicine centres delivering care to highly rural populations produce greater economic benefits.

1. **The effectiveness of telemental health: A 2013 review**
Introduction: The effectiveness of any new technology is typically measured in order to determine whether it successfully achieves equal or superior objectives over what is currently offered. Research in telemental **health** - in this article mainly referring to telepsychiatry and psychological services - has advanced rapidly since 2003, and a new effectiveness review is needed. Materials and Methods: The authors reviewed the published literature to synthesize information on what is and what is not effective related to telemental health. Terms for the search included, but were not limited to, telepsychiatry, effectiveness, **mental** health, e-health, videoconferencing, telemedicine, cost, access, and international. Results: Telemental **health** is effective for diagnosis and assessment across many populations (adult, child, geriatric, and ethnic) and for disorders in many settings (emergency, home health) and appears to be comparable to in-person care. In addition, this review has identified new models of care (i.e., collaborative care, asynchronous, mobile) with equally positive outcomes. Conclusions: Telemental **health** is effective and increases access to care. Future directions suggest the need for more research on service models, specific disorders, the issues relevant to culture and language, and cost.  2013, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

0. **AiRCare: A Naturalistic Evaluation of the Effectiveness of a Protracted Telephone-Based Recovery Assistance Program on Continuing Care Outcomes**
Background & Objective Substance use disorder treatments are increasingly being contextualized within a disease management framework. Within this context, there is an identified need to maintain patients in treatment for longer periods of time in order to help them learn how to manage their disease. One way to meet this need is through telephone-based interventions that engage patients, and include more active outreach attempts and involvement of the patient's family. This study sought to evaluate the effectiveness of three formats of an intensive 12-month post-discharge telephone-based case management approach (AiRCare) on adherence to continuing care plans and substance use outcomes. Methods Data were abstracted from electronic medical records for 379 patients (59.9% male) discharged from a residential treatment program located in the southwestern U.S. from 2013 to 2015. Patients were categorized into one of three groups and received telephone contacts based on their self-selection upon admission to residential treatment (i.e., patient only, family only, and both patient and family). Outcome variables included re-engagement and re-admission rates, quality of life, abstinence rates at 6 and 12 months, and compliance with continuing care plans. Results & Conclusions Favorable short- and long-term outcomes were found for the majority of patients, irrespective of case management group. There appeared to be some value in the addition of family contacts to patient contacts with respect to reducing risk for 12-month re-admission to residential care. These positive but preliminary indications of the effectiveness of AiRCare require replication in a well-powered, randomized controlled trial.  2016 Elsevier Inc. EID: 2-s2.0-84993969530
1. **Telemedicine-delivered treatment interventions for substance use disorders: A systematic review**
With increased negative impacts from opioid and other substance use disorders in the US, it is important for treatments to not only be effective, but also accessible to patients. Treatment delivery via telemedicine, specifically, the use of videoconferencing, which allows real time communication between a patient and a clinician at a distant site, has been shown to be an effective approach for increasing reach and access to treatments for mental health disorders and other chronic illnesses. This systematic review identified and summarized studies examining the effectiveness of telemedicine interventions to deliver treatment for patients with substance use disorders. Out of 841 manuscripts that met our **search** criteria, 13 studies met the inclusion criteria. Studies covered interventions for nicotine, **alcohol** and opioid use disorders. They varied widely in size, quality, and in the comparison groups examined. Studies examined both delivery of psychotherapy and medication treatments. Most studies suggested telemedicine interventions were associated with high patient satisfaction and are an effective alternative, especially when access to treatment is otherwise limited. However, there were substantial methodological limitations to the research conducted to date. Further studies are needed, including larger scale randomized studies that examine different models of telemedicine that can be integrated into existing healthcare delivery settings, to increase the use of effective treatments for patients with substance use disorders.  2019 EID: 2-s2.0-85063614225
2. **Telepsychological services with criminal justice and substance abuse clients: A systematic review and meta-analysis**
Recent years have seen the incorporation of telepsychology into poorly accessed, rural, and underserved settings, including criminal justice and substance abuse treatment. A systematic **search** of the literature on telepsychological and related services with justice-involved and substance abuse clients revealed numerous descriptive reports, but few empirical studies. The results of 3 studies of criminal justice participants and 2 studies of substance-abuse participants were subjected to a series of 5 outcome-specific meta-analyses (mental health symptoms, therapeutic processes, program engagement, program performance, and service satisfaction). These 5 studies, all of which utilized a comparison group, contributed a total of 342 participants and 14 total **effect** sizes. Summary data on 3 additional uncontrolled studies are also presented. Results indicated that telepsychological outcomes were at least comparable with in-person outcomes. This review serves as an initial reference for clinicians and policymakers working with criminal justice and substance abuse clients, but also highlights the need for more rigorous scientific investigation into the nuances of telepsychological practice.

3. **Treatment outcome comparison between telepsychiatry and face-to-face buprenorphine medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorder: A 2-year retrospective data analysis**
Objectives: To retrospectively review **clinic** records to assess the difference between face-to-face and telepsychiatry buprenorphine medication-assisted treatment (MAT) programs for the treatment of opioid use disorder on 3 outcomes: additional substance use, average time to achieve 30 and 90 consecutive days of abstinence, and treatment retention rates at 90 and 365 days. Methods: Medical records of patients (N=100) who were participating in telepsychiatry and in face-to-face group-based outpatient buprenorphine MAT programs were reviewed and assessed using descriptive statistical analysis. Results: In comparison with the telepsychiatry MAT group, the face-to-face MAT group showed no significant difference in terms of additional substance use, time to 30 days (P=0.09) and 90 days of abstinence (P=0.22), or retention rates at 90 and 365 days (P=0.99). Conclusions: We did not find any significant statistical difference between telepsychiatry buprenorphine MAT intervention through videoconference and face-to-face MAT treatment in our Comprehensive Opioid Addiction Treatment model for individuals diagnosed with opioid use disorder in terms of additional substance use, average time to 30 and 90 days of abstinence, and treatment retention rates.

4. **Effectiveness and feasibility of telepsychiatry in resource constrained environments? A systematic review of the evidence**
Objective: A review of systematic reviews of the effectiveness and feasibility of videoconference-based telepsychiatry services for resource constrained environments was conducted. Specifically with the aim of producing an evidence-based review of the effectiveness and feasibility of videoconference-based telepsychiatry services in resource constrained countries like South Africa. Methods: Eight key questions on telepsychiatry effectiveness and feasibility were identified and inclusion and exclusion criteria were developed. Review of citations from 2000-2011 from CINAHL, Medline, Pubmed, PsycInfo, EBSCOhost, SABINET, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CCTR), Cochrane Controlled Trial Registry (CCTR), Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE), unpublished abstracts through NEXUS and internet **search** engines (Google/Google scholar) was conducted. Results: Ten systematic reviews were included for review. Despite the methodological limitations and heterogeneity of the systematic reviews, there appears to be good evidence of effectiveness (reliability and improved outcomes) and feasibility (use, satisfaction, acceptability and cost) for videoconference-based telepsychiatry internationally. The application of this evidence in lower middle income countries is dependent on the integration of telepsychiatry into local health **system** contexts. Conclusion: Based on the evidence, resource constrained countries such as South Africa should be encouraged to develop telepsychiatry programs along with rigorous evaluation methods.

5. **Use of Tele-Mental Health in Conjunction With In-Person Care: A Qualitative Exploration of Implementation Models**
OBJECTIVE: Although use of tele-mental health services is growing, there is limited research on how tele-mental health is deployed. This project aimed to describe how health centers use tele-mental health in conjunction with in-person care. METHODS: The 2018 Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration Behavioral Health Treatment Services Locator database was used to identify community mental health centers and federally qualified health centers with telehealth capabilities. Maximum diversity sampling was applied to recruit health center leaders to participate in semistructured interviews. Inductive and deductive approaches were used to develop site summaries, and a matrix analysis was conducted to identify and refine themes. RESULTS: Twenty health centers in 14 states participated. All health centers used telepsychiatry for diagnostic assessment and medication prescribing, and 10 also offered therapy via telehealth. Some health centers used their own staff to provide tele-mental health services, whereas others contracted with external providers. In most health centers, tele-mental health was used as an adjunct to in-person care. In choosing between tele-mental health and in-person care, health centers often considered patient preference, patient acuity, and insurance status or payer. Although most health centers planned to continue offering tele-mental health, participants noted drawbacks, including less patient engagement, challenges sharing information within the care team, and greater inefficiency. CONCLUSIONS: Tele-mental health is generally used as an adjunct to in-person care. The results of this study can inform policy makers and clinicians regarding the various delivery models that incorporate tele-mental health. EID: 2-s2.0-85084961417

0. **Counseling center-based tele-mental health for students at a rural university**
Students attending **rural** academic institutions often have no immediate access to psychiatrists to supplement on-site Counseling Center (CC) services. Because the Medical College of Georgia (MCG) could not cost-effectively provide on-site psychiatry services to Georgia Southern University (GSU) students, the two institutions explored telehealth services delivered by supervised Psychiatry residents using Web-based videoconferencing on MCG's virtual private network. GSU counselors completed **client** severity rating forms. CC clients in ongoing therapy who were judged to be in **need** of psychiatric services were referred to the Tele-clinic (TC). CC counselors referred the most challenged students to TC according to total distress score on intake, clinician intake assessment of **client** difficulty, and **client** **need** for medications. After seeing the clients in TC, MCG residents also completed GSU CC **client** severity rating forms. Post-intake and satisfaction surveys already in use at the GSU CC were completed both by CC clients not in TC and by CC clients jointly enrolled in TC. TC and CC populations were compared by gender, race, past mental health treatment, past psychiatric hospitalization, and past and **current** use of psychotropic drugs. Telepsychiatry conducted using low bandwidth videoconferencing successfully supplemented GSU CC mental healthcare, especially for clients with the most serious problems, and did so without travel from campus and within the milieu of daily student life. Cost-effective telepsychiatry services can successfully supplement management of students with mental health issues who attend rural, smaller, and/or resource-challenged academic institutions.

1. **Telemedicine and advances in urban and rural healthcare delivery in Africa**
Telecardiology holds great promise for Africa, from tele-echocardiography and tele-ECG s, to home monitoring and text messaging for medication adherence monitoring. The burden of disease is great and there is an extreme shortage of health professionals. Telemedicine can provide access to scarce specialist care, improve the quality of care in **rural** areas and reduce the **need** for **rural** patients to travel to seek medical attention. International cross border service can alleviate the shortage of doctors. But telecardiology, and telemedicine uptake in general, has been poor in Africa. Legal and ethical issues around local and cross border telemedicine have not been resolved. The literature was reviewed and obstacles to telemedicine in Africa and **current** telemedicine activities in Africa, are described. There are few sustained telemedicine services in Africa with the exception of tele-education. There is an expectation that mobile phones will facilitate a range of telemedicine activities in Africa. Africa needs telemedicine.  2013 Elsevier Inc. EID: 2-s2.0-84887948228

0. **Thinking Outside the Box: Are We Ready for Teleprecepting to Expand Training and Practice Venues?**
A significant challenge related to nurse practitioner (NP) training is the shortage of clinical sites with qualified faculty to precept NP interns. The problem is compounded in **rural** communities with provider shortages, restricting their opportunities to train (and potentially recruit) new APRNs. Consequently, these underserved communities have difficulty accessing specialty providers, such as Psychiatric Mental Health Nurse Practitioners (PMHNPs). Combined with geographic distance from urban communities and generally lower pay, many **rural** and/or remote communities struggle with the disparity in contrast to more populated regions. A **needs** assessment of an underserved county with poor **access** to psychiatric **services** suggests that contracted telepsychiatry was costly and failed to address the long-term dearth of local psychiatric providers. Stakeholders reported that local RNs (and possibly FNPs) were employed by the local hospital and that a subgroup may have aptitude and interest in psychiatry if a university program and preceptors were available. Collaborating with an urban PMHNP program, televideo technology for clinical training and preceptor development offers a solution to the dearth of preceptors. A pilot intervention will use teleprecepting aimed at establishing best practice guidelines for implementation of this novel approach to expanding the clinical training and capacity in **rural** and under-served communities.  2019,  2019 University of California San Francisco.

1. **Training psychiatrists for rural practice: A 20-year follow-up**
Objective: This report describes the Rural Psychiatry Residency Program at the University of New Mexico (UNM RPRP) and presents findings from a survey of program graduates. Methods: Current practice location of residency graduates was identified to learn whether graduates of the UNM RPRP continued to practice in **rural** communities compared to the graduates of the traditional residency program. Additionally, a web-based survey was completed by 37 of the 60 graduates who participated in the UNM RPRP since its inception in 1991 through 2010. Questions addressed current practice, perceived barriers, and perceptions of experiences. Results: Thirty-seven percent of the graduates from the UNM RPRP currently practice in **rural** communities compared to 10 % of the graduates from the traditional residency track. Of the survey respondents, 95 % continue to work with underserved individuals. Reported barriers to practice in **rural** areas include professional isolation, lack of referral resources, and travel distances. Respondents reported valuing education about systems based practice and telepsychiatry. Conclusion: Purposeful and well-coordinated educational opportunities situated in **rural** community **health** clinics can address some of the barriers for recruiting and retaining practicing psychiatrists in **rural** areas. Practical skill building at the individual, agency, and system level is integral in training psychiatrists for work in these communities. In particular, the use of telepsychiatry emerged as an important practical application for the provision of **rural** **mental** **health** care.  2014 Academic Psychiatry. EID: 2-s2.0-84907187036

3. **A Review of Mental Health Approaches for Rural Communities: Complexities and Opportunities in the Canadian Context**
Three **mental** **health** approaches with potential relevance to **rural** Canada were reviewed: telepsychiatry, integrated **mental** **health** models, and community-based approaches. These approaches have been evaluated in relation to their cost-effectiveness, comprehensiveness, client-centredness, cultural appropriateness, acceptability, feasibility and fidelity; criteria that may vary amidst **rural** contexts. Collaborative approaches to care, technologies fully integrated into local **health** systems, multi-sectoral capacity-building, and further engagement with informal social support networks may be particularly promising strategies in **rural** communities. More research is required to determine **rural** **mental** **health** pathways among diverse social groups, and further, to establish the acceptability of novel approaches in **mental** health.

4. **Continuing professional development for Australian rural psychiatrists by videoconference**
Objective: The Rural Special Interest Group (RSIG) of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists provided a program of educational meetings for psychiatrists and trainees in **rural** locations to decrease professional isolation and facilitate opportunities to obtain credit for continuing professional development (CPD) purposes in ongoing professional registration. A pilot peer review group by videoconference was also implemented in Western Australia, to provide peer review for psychiatrists working in isolation. Method: Six national interactive videoconferenced education seminars were provided. The membership was polled prior to the program for topic preferences and requested speakers, who were subsequently approached to present the seminars. A West Australian peer review group was formed, involving psychiatrists from five different **rural** locations and one psychiatrist from the metropolitan area. Results: National seminars were attended by 106 individuals (67% consultant psychiatrists, 17% trainees and 16% allied **health** professionals). Evaluation demonstrates favourable views of the content and quality of the presentations and impact on practice patterns. Conclusions: Attendance at seminars via videoconferencing provided **rural** psychiatrists with opportunities to obtain CPD credit without the **need** to travel, providing a cost-effective alternative for accessing education. Involvement enabled interaction among peers throughout Australia, alleviating professional isolation and generating networking opportunities. The West Australian peer review group demonstrated sustainability with a commitment to continuation and positive impact on practice. EID: 2-s2.0-48749111372

6. **Telepsychiatry for neurocognitive testing in older rural latino adults**
As the population of older Latinos in the U.S. increases, availability of culturally adapted geriatric psychiatry **services** is becoming a growing concern. This issue is exacerbated for **rural** Latino populations. In this study, we assessed whether neuro-cognitive assessment via telepsychiatry (TP) using a Spanish-language battery would be comparable to in-person (IP) testing using the same battery in a sample of Spanish-speaking older adults in a **rural** setting. Patients (N = 22) received IP and TP testing 2 weeks apart. The order of IP and TP test administrations in individual subjects was determined randomly. Comparison of scores indicated that there were no significant differences between IP and TP test performance though both groups scored non-significantly higher at the second visit. This study demonstrates feasibility and utility of neurocognitive testing in Spanish using TP among older **rural** Latinos.  2015 American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry.

7. **Rural mental health: Implications for telepsychiatry in clinical service, workforce development, and organizational capacity**
In Hawai'i, **rural** residents suffer disproportionately from poor **health** and **mental** **health** outcomes. Hawai'i's island geography makes **rural** **health** **service** disparities especially compelling. Physician workforce shortages are projected to increase, despite 30 years of programs aimed at recruiting physicians to **rural** areas. Telepsychiatry has been shown to be a feasible way to provide a variety of **health** **services** to individuals living in **rural** areas with limited **access** to healthcare. The University of Hawai'i Rural Health Collaboration (UHRHC) was established by the Department of Psychiatry to address the **need** for workforce development and **rural** **access** to **mental** **health** **services** across the State of Hawai'i by using telepsychiatry. Partnerships with community **health** clinics have been formed to provide patient care and consultation-liaison **services** through telepsychiatry technology. In addition, UHRHC focuses on workforce development in its residency training curriculum by utilizing a service-learning approach to **rural** **mental** health. Evaluation of these efforts is currently underway, with preliminary evidence suggesting that UHRHC is a promising strategy to increase **access** to critical **mental** **health** **services** and reduce **health** disparities in **rural** Hawai'i.

8. **Attitudes toward medical and mental health care delivered via telehealth applications among rural and urban primary care patients**
Adequate **health** care **services** are often not available in **rural** and remote areas, and this problem is expected to grow worse in the near future. "Telehealth" interventions represent a strategy for addressing **access** to care problems. We examined and compared attitudes toward medical and **mental** **health** care delivered via telehealth applications among adult **rural** (n = 112) and urban (n = 78) primary care patients. We also examined attitudes toward telehealth applications among a subset of patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-a group likely in **need** of specialized services. Both urban and **rural** patients were receptive to receiving medical and psychiatric **services** via telehealth. There were few meaningful differences across variables between urban and **rural** patients, and there were no meaningful differences by PTSD status. These findings support the feasibility of telehealth applications, particularly for **rural** patients who may not otherwise receive needed services.  2008 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

0. **Practical issues in delivery of clinician-to-patient telemental health in an academic medical center**
Background: In the age of online communication, psychiatric care can now be provided via videoconferencing technologies. While virtual visits as a part of telepsychiatry and telemental **health** provide a highly efficient and beneficial modality of care, the implementation of virtual visits requires attention to quality and safety issues. As practitioners continue to utilize this technology, issues of clinician licensing, treatment outcomes of virtual visits versus in-person visits, and **cost** offset require ongoing study. Methods: This review provides an overview of the topics of technology, legal and regulatory issues, clinical issues, and **cost** savings as they relate to practicing psychiatry and psychology via virtual visits in an academic medical center. We review the telepsychiatry/telemental **health** effectiveness literature from 2013 to the present. Our literature searches used the following terms: telemental **health** effective, telepsychiatry effective, telepsychiatry efficacy, and telemental **health** efficacy. These searches produced 58 articles, reduced to 16 when including only articles that address effectiveness of clinician-to-patient services. Results: The technological, legal, and regulatory issues vary from state to state and over time. The emerging research addressing diverse populations and disorders provides strong evidence for the effectiveness of telepsychiatry. Cost savings are difficult to precisely determine and depend on the scope of the **cost** and **benefit** measured. Conclusion: Establishing a telepsychiatry program requires a comprehensive approach with up-to-date legal and technological considerations.  2017 President and Fellows of Harvard College.

2. **A study on collaborative telepsychiatric consultations to outpatients of district hospitals of Karnataka, India**
Introduction: The Indian National Mental Health Survey (NMHS) of 20152016 has estimated 13.7% lifetime and 10.6% point prevalence for **mental** illnesses. It has identified that the treatment gap for **mental** illnesses ranges between 70% and 92%. Tele-Psychiatric consultations could be an alternative and innovative approach to bridge this gap in low resource settings. Aims: To study the sociodemographic and clinical profiles of patients who have received collaborative Tele-Psychiatric consultations across district hospitals in Karnataka, India. Methodology: We performed a retrospective review of case files of patients who have received collaborative Tele-Psychiatric consultations from January 2013 to June 2017 through video-conferencing. A total of 139 consultations were provided to patients in the state of Karnataka. Results: The mean age of the sample is 31 (15.5) years. 61.8% were male and 79.8% were aged more than 18 years. In total, 25.9% of them had schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, 14.4% had **mental** retardation, 13.7% had a mood disorder and 14.4% had a substance use disorder. 67.6% of patients had been advised pharmacotherapy, 7.9% had been advised rehabilitation along with pharmacotherapy and 24.4% were advised further evaluation of illness and inpatient care at a higher centre. Conclusion: Collaborative tele-psychiatric consultations to district hospitals from an academic tertiary care hospital can be feasible and are likely to **benefit** patients from rural areas. There is a need for more studies to elucidate their acceptability by patients, caregivers and professionals.  2018 Elsevier B.V. EID: 2-s2.0-85054061928
3. **The use of telepsychiatry within forensic practice: a literature review on the use of videolinka ten-year follow-up**
In the last decade, telepsychiatrythe use of telecommunications technologies to deliver psychiatric services from a distancehas been increasingly utilised in many areas of **mental** **health** care. Since the review by Khalifa and colleagues in 2007 the body of literature relevant to the forensic applications of telepsychiatry has grown substantially, albeit not by much in the United Kingdom. In the **current** review, we aim to provide an update summary of the literature published since 2007 to determine the effectiveness and feasibility of increasing telepsychiatry utilisation in forensic practice. The literature reviewed provides some encouraging evidence that telepsychiatry is a reliable, effective and highly acceptable method for delivering **mental** **health** care in forensic settings. There are also a number of papers that indicate the use of telepsychiatry may be **cost** effective for **health** providers in the longer term. Further research is required to consider the potential legal and ethical implications of using telepsychiatry in forensic settings.  2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

4. **Locum Tenens and Telepsychiatry: Trends in Psychiatric Care**
Abstract Background: There is a national shortage of psychiatrists, and according to nationally available data, it is projected to get worse. Locum tenens psychiatry and telepsychiatry are two ways to fill the shortages of psychiatric providers that exist in many areas in the United States. Employment and salary data in these areas can be used to illuminate **current** trends and anticipate future solutions to the problem of increasing demand for, and decreasing supply of, psychiatrists in the United States. Materials and Methods: A search was conducted of the literature and relevant Web sites, including PubMed, Google Scholar, and www.google.com, as well as information obtained from locum tenens and telepsychiatry organizations. Results: There is a dearth of data on the use of locum tenens in the field of psychiatry, with little available prior to 2000 and few published studies since then. The majority of the data available are survey data from commercial entities. These data show trends toward increasing demand for psychiatry along with increasing salaries and indicate the utilization of telepsychiatry and locum tenens telepsychiatry is increasing. The published academic data that are available show that although locum tenens psychiatry is slightly inferior to routine psychiatric care, telepsychiatry is generally equivalent to face-to-face care. Conclusions: One can anticipate that as the national shortage of psychiatrists is expected to accelerate, use of both locum tenens and telepsychiatry may also continue to increase. Telepsychiatry offers several possible advantages, including lower cost, longer-term services, quality of care, and models that can extend psychiatric services. If **current** trends continue, systems that demand face-to-face psychiatry may find themselves paying higher fees for locum tenens psychiatrists, whereas others may employ psychiatrists more efficiently with telepsychiatry.

5. **Designing and implementing an innovative digitally driven primary care psychiatry program in India**
Background: Primary Care Doctors (PCDs) are the first contact for majority of patients with psychiatric disorders across the world including India. They often provide symptomatic treatment which is naturally inadequate. Absence or inadequate exposure to psychiatric training during undergraduate medical education is one of the prime reasons. Classroom training (CRT), a standard practice to train PCDs is driven by specialist based psychiatric curriculum and inherently lacks clinical translational value. Aim and Context: The 'Department of Psychiatry' of 'National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences', Bengaluru, India has recently come up with an innovative digitally driven modules of 'Primary Care Psychiatry Program' (PCPP) for practicing PCDs. Goal of this paper is to provide an overview of all these (five) modules with its various stages of implementation. Methods: Authors briefly discuss the **current** status of primary care psychiatry in India and also narrate the newly designed five modules of PCPP in this paper. Results and Discussion: An adopted psychiatric curriculum is designed in 'Clinical Schedules for Primary Care Psychiatry' (CSP) which is an integral part of PCPP. This is brief clinical schedules contains culturally appropriate screening questionnaire, transdiagnostic classification of 8 core psychiatric disorders, diagnostic, referral and management guidelines. PCPP contains 5 modules named as orientation module, basic module, advanced module [Tele-psychiatric 'On-Consultation Training' (Tele-OCT)], videoconference based continuing skill development module, and collaborative video consultation modules which covers all essential areas of primary care psychiatry for practicing PCDs. Last three modules are fully designed digital modules in hub and spoke model of Tele Medicine. In this designed program, the CSP and Tele-OCT are two path braking innovations having inbuilt higher clinical translation value. The challenges and opportunities that could be faced during its implementation across India are also discussed. Conclusion and Future Directions: Innovative PCPP is pragmatic in nature and has potential for higher clinical translational value. Once validated thoroughly, PCPP has potential for pan-India expansion. There is a need for artificial intelligence-based modules for next phase of PCPP in India considering her population and lesser number of available psychiatrists.  2018 Indian Journal of Psychiatry | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.

0. **Prospective acceptance of distinct mobile mental health features in psychiatric patients and mental health professionals**
Background: Despite numerous mobile **health** (mHealth) applications available, current impact on **mental** healthcare is low. Users face overwhelming variety of applications and sensors. Evidence for **distinct** features' effectiveness is largely lacking. Along with technical feasibility and data security issues, readiness and preferences of patients predetermine engagement and impact of mHealth in psychiatry. Objective: We aimed to assess the prospective attitudes of psychiatric patients and **mental** **health** professionals (MHP) towards mHealth applications in general and with regard to **distinct** features. Methods: We conducted a survey entailing 486 subjects (297 MHP and 189 patients). Results: Professionals and patients indicate both, considerable acceptance and rejection for most features. Marked concerns across groups relate to data security in general. Actimetry and geotracking were considered particularly skeptical. Importantly, most patients prefer to be prompted timely about **health** status changes. Conclusion: Altogether, evidence indicates substantial support for mHealth features in **mental** healthcare despite considerable rejection of **distinct** features. We conclude that tighter collaboration between researchers, developers and clinicians must **address** matching mHealth-apps to patients' needs. Improved information on potential risks and possibilities associated with mHealth features is strongly indicated in MHP and psychiatric patients in **order** to reach an appropriately informed decision on individual involvement.  2018 Elsevier Ltd EID: 2-s2.0-85059267634
1. **Implementation and Utilisation of Telepsychiatry in Ontario: A Population-Based Study**
Objective: Rural areas in Ontario have fewer psychiatrists, making access to specialist **mental** **health** care challenging. Our objective was to characterise psychiatrists delivering and patients receiving telepsychiatry in Ontario and to determine the number of patients who accessed a psychiatrist via telepsychiatry following discharge from psychiatric hospitalisation. Method: We conducted a serial panel study to evaluate the characteristics of psychiatrists providing telepsychiatry from April 2007 to March 2013. In addition, we conducted a cross-sectional study for fiscal **year** 2012-2013 to examine telepsychiatry patient characteristics and create an in-need patient cohort of individuals with a **recent** psychiatric hospitalisation that assessed if they had follow-up with a psychiatrist in person or through telepsychiatry within 1 **year** of discharge. Results: In fiscal **year** 2012-2013, a total of 3801 people had 5635 telepsychiatry visits, and 7% (n = 138) of Ontario psychiatrists provided telepsychiatry. Of the 48,381 people identified as in need of psychiatric care, 60% saw a local psychiatrist, 39% saw no psychiatrist, and less than 1% saw a psychiatrist through telepsychiatry only or telepsychiatry in addition to local psychiatry within a year. Three northern regions had more than 50% of in-need patients fail to access psychiatry within 1 year. Conclusions: Currently, relatively few patients and psychiatrists use telepsychiatry. In addition, patients scarcely access telepsychiatry for posthospitalisation follow-up. This study, which serves as a preliminary baseline for telepsychiatry in Ontario, demonstrates that telepsychiatry has not evolved systematically to **address** need and highlights the importance of system-level planning when implementing telepsychiatry to optimise access to care.

0. **Enchantment in psychiatric medicine**
Max Weber's 1918 essay Science as a Vocation posits that increasing scientific knowledge has contributed to a disenchantment of the natural world. His argument has implications for medicine, an applied science aimed at the improvement of health, including psychiatric medicine. Using Weber's argument, this **paper** discusses the ambivalent relationship psychiatry has with technology. On one hand, based on the historical roots of the specialty and the influence of psychodynamic psychotherapy, psychiatrists believe themselves to be masters of the invisible space between physicians and their patients. They claim to have the skills and insight that enable them to establish a unique kind of relationship in which communication not only allows them to diagnose, but also to heal through a variety of psychotherapeutic techniques. As a result, many psychiatrists are wary of the introduction of technology into therapeutic setting and the potential for this type of communication to be disrupted or diminished in value, often basing their concern on the ways in which technology has been witnessed to be disenchanting in other medical specialties. On the other hand, others see the future practice of psychiatry best guided through whole-hearted embrace of brain-based medical technology, which has been stunted by the complexity of the brain and relative lack of research funding compared to other medical specialties. This discussion within the field is timely, as on the horizon lies the holy grail of technological advancement for psychiatric practice: definitive biomarkers to diagnose mental illness and provide individualized treatments.  2019 Elsevier B.V.

1. **Usefulness of videoconferencing in psychiatric emergencies -- a qualitative study**
High quality health services for psychiatric emergencies are difficult to maintain 24h a day in sparsely populated areas, where the availability of specialists are limited. To overcome this challenge, the University Hospital of North Norway implemented an on-call system in psychiatric emergencies, by which psychiatrists are accessible 24/7 for telephone and videoconferencing consultations with patients and nurses at three regional psychiatric centers. The purpose of this study was to explore the usefulness of videoconferencing consultations in psychiatric emergencies. The on-call psychiatrists and nurses at the regional psychiatric centers who participated in at least one videoconferencing consultation were recruited for semi-structured interviews: 5 psychiatrists and 19 nurses for a total of 24 participants. The interviews were performed from July of 2012 to June of 2013. The interviews were transcribed and analyzed using a stepwise-deductive-inductive approach supported by the HyperRESEARCH analysis software. After the introduction of the videoconferencing system, telephone consultations were still used for straightforward situations when further treatment or admission decisions were obvious. Videoconferencing consultations, during which patients were present, were useful for challenging situations when there was 1) uncertainty regarding the degree of illness or the level of treatment, 2) a need to clarify the severity of the patient condition, 3) a need to build an alliance with the patient, and 4) disagreement either between health personnel or between the patient and health personnel. Videoconferencing is useful for challenging and complex psychiatric emergencies and is a suitable tool for building **high** quality, decentralized psychiatric services.  2017, The Author(s).

2. **The use of telemedicine in psychiatry**
This **paper** examines the potential effects of using video-conferencing within the field of mental health in the UK. In order to assess the usefulness of telepsychiatric services, an electronic search was conducted for articles published between August 1998 and July 2006 using the MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychINFO and Telemedicine and Information Exchange (TIE) databases. The search was carried out using the following terms: telepsychiatry, videoconferencing and telepsychology. A total of 178 articles were identified and based on review of the abstracts 72 were identified as being specific to efficacy, cost-effectiveness and satisfaction with psychiatric services delivered via videoconferencing. This **paper** concludes that the use of **video** conferencing can enhance psychiatric services within the UK especially for those patients who live in rural areas. Current advances in technology make this an increasingly more reliable and cost-effective method for assessing patients. The limitations of telemedicine are discussed and it is clear that this type of care is not suitable for all patients. Further research is required to assess the types of patients that telepsychiatry is most suitable for.  2006 The Author. EID: 2-s2.0-33750682657
3. **Challenges and perspectives in the private practice of psychiatry: The development of tele-psychiatry [Enjeux et perspectives de la psychiatrie librale: le dveloppement de la tl-psychiatrie]**
Fall 2018 a comprehensive legislation has been launched in France on the practice of telemedicine, hence tele-psychiatry, historically one of its oldest application. This **paper** resulted from a presentation that has been made at the French Medico-Psychological Society President's Day, and aims at pointing out certain regulatory, ethical, and practical challenges in the development of tele-psychiatry, in a truly progressive manner, given its importance to the accelerating processes of digitalisation within our societies. French users of telemedicine services are 4 % only, which has to be compared to 31 % of Saudis: usage has evolved since 2010, year in which the first telemedicine legislation has been implemented in France. In just a few years, mobile health (m-health) has become increasingly important, while the legislation, and the funding models, were unchanged. Psychiatrists practicing telemedicine may simply use **video** consultation, but those who wish to, can also digitalise their practice from case history to analysis and prescription, with dedicated assistance software. In any case, practising telemedicine requires the use of approved software, prior training, and professionalism. Key features of Good Video Consultation Practices are described therein, along with broad recommendations on practicing trans-border **video** consultation sessions.  2018 Elsevier Masson SAS EID: 2-s2.0-85059465160
4. **A randomized clinical trial of home-based telepsychiatric outpatient care via videoconferencing: Design, methodology, and implementation**
Background: Healthcare providers are continuously challenged to find innovative, cost-effective alternatives and to scale up existent services to meet the growing demand upon mental health care delivery. Due to continuous advances in technologies, telepsychiatry has become an effective tool for psychiatric care. In 2012, the Institute of Psychiatry of the University of So Paulo Medical School started a randomized clinical trial of home-based telepsychiatric outpatient care via videoconferencing. Objective: The objective of this article is to describe the design, methodology and implementation of a pilot project, which aimed to verify the applicability and efficiency of psychiatric attendance via Internet-based videoconferencing in a resource-constrained environment. Methods: The project consisted of a 12 months follow-up study with a randomized clinical trial, which compared various quality indicators between home-based telepsychiatric aftercare via videoconferencing and face-to-face aftercare. Results: The final sample comprised 107 outpatients (53 in the telepsychiatry group and 54 in the control group). Among 1,227 realized consultations, 489 were held by videoconferencing. Satisfaction with the aftercare by videoconferencing and the medication delivery was **high** among patients. Attending psychiatrists were satisfied with the assistance by videoconferencing. Discussion: The experiences during this pilot project have overall been very positive and psychiatric outpatient care by videoconferencing seems viable to treat patients even in a resource-constrained environment.  2015, Lemos Editorial e Graficos Ltda.

1. **Tower of Babel Problem in Telehealth: Addressing the Health Information Exchange Needs of the North Carolina Statewide Telepsychiatry Program (NC-STeP)**
Telepsychiatry is a viable option for providing psychiatric care to those who are currently underserved or who lack access to services. While the current technology is adequate for most uses, and continues to advance, there remain barriers to its widespread utilization. One such barrier when working with different healthcare systems is that they utilize different electronic medical record systems (EMRs). This **paper** describes the experience of the North Carolina Statewide Telepsychiatry Program (NC-STeP) with this problem and how the program successfully resolved it by establishing a web portal that connects participating hospital emergency departments and remote psychiatric providers to share secure electronic **health** information regarding patient encounters across different EMRs. The Portal also facilitates scheduling, status tracking, and reporting on each patient encounter, as well as delivers the necessary data for the billing to process charges for each consult and to administrators for the operation of the program. The portal effectively bridges the needs of the multiple actors in the telepsychiatry virtual encounter. It provides an efficient experience for the patient and the point-of-care provider, a reliable document exchange for the psychiatric provider, and effective record keeping for the billing and government entities.  2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

3. **Post-disaster gulf coast recovery using telehealth**
Objective: The Gulf Coast continues to struggle with service need far outpacing available resources. Since 2005, the Regional Coordinating Center for Hurricane Response (RCC) at Morehouse School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, has supported telehealth solutions designed to meet high service needs (e.g., psychiatry) within **primary** care and other healthcare organizations. The overall RCC vision is to support autonomous, useful, and sustainable telehealth programs towards mitigating unmet disaster-related needs. Subjects and Methods: To assess Gulf Coast telehealth experiences, we conducted semistructured interviews with both regional key informants and national organizations with Gulf Coast recovery interests. Using qualitative-descriptive analysis, interview transcripts were analyzed to identify shared development themes. Results: Thirty-eight key informants were interviewed, representing a 77.6% participation rate among organizations engaged by the RCC. Seven elements critical to telehealth success were identified: Funding, Regulatory, Workflow, Attitudes, Personnel, Technology, and Evaluation. These key informant accounts reveal shared insights with telehealth regarding successes, challenges, and recommendations. Conclusions: The seven elements critical to telehealth success both confirm and organize development principles from a diverse collective of healthcare stakeholders. The structured nature of these insights suggests a generalizable framework upon which other organizations might **develop** telehealth strategies toward addressing high service needs with limited resources.

The Regional Coordinating Center for Hurricane Response (RCC) collaborated with the EXPORT Centers (Centers of Excellence in Partnerships for Community Outreach, Research on Health Disparities and Training) to rebuild, revitalize, and improve the **health** care infrastructure in the Gulf Coast states damaged by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. This initiative aims to enhance the provision of **health** care by installing Electronic Health Records and Telepsychiatry systems throughout the Gulf Coast. Through the EXPORT Centers, the RCC plans to perform screening and surveillance projects within the communities and **develop** research projects focused on eliminating **health** disparities affecting underserved populations in the region. Another goal is to establish partnerships with EXPORT Centers, Community Health Centers, and other essential **primary** care practices in hurricane-ravaged communities. Through these partnerships, the overarching goal is to create a balanced **health** care system model that academic institutions can integrate into preventive care for emergency planning and research.

5. **An Update on Telepsychiatry and How It Can Leverage Collaborative, Stepped, and Integrated Services to Primary Care**
Introduction: In this era of patient-centered care, telepsychiatry (TP; video or synchronous) provides quality care with outcomes as good as in-person care, facilitates access to care, and leverages a wide range of treatments at a distance. Method: This conceptual review article explores TP as applied to newer models of care (e.g., collaborative, stepped, and integrated care). Results: The field of psychosomatic medicine (PSM) has developed clinical care models, educates interdisciplinary team members, and provides leadership to clinical teams. PSM is uniquely positioned to steer TP and implement other telebehavioral **health** care options (e.g., e-mail/telephone, psych/mental **health** apps) in the future in **primary** care. Together, PSM and TP provide versatility to **health** systems by enabling more patient points-of-entry, matching patient needs with provider skills, and helping providers work at the top of their licenses. TP and other technologies make collaborative, stepped, and integrated care less costly and more accessible. Conclusion: Effective **health** care delivery matches the intensity of the services to the needs of a patient population or clinic, standardizes interventions, and evaluates both process and clinical outcomes. More research is indicated on the application of TP and other technologies to these service delivery models.  2018 Academy of Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry. EID: 2-s2.0-85043382170

0. **Telepsychology in Australia: 2020 vision**
The current roll-out of broadband across Australia provides new opportunities for psychologists to reach out to residents in remote and **rural** areas. With the advent of **internet** protocol (IP)-based videoconferencing, telepsychology is becoming more accessible and affordable, and a potential solution to those in remote areas who require access to specialist assessment and psychotherapy services. Telepsychology represents a high-quality/low-cost model of service delivery. Findings to date suggest that outcome might be equivalent to in-person therapy across a range of client groups both using standardised assessments and evidence-based therapies. Studies have consistently shown that clients rate **high** levels of satisfaction and therapeutic rapport. However, uptake among psychologists has been slow. This article provides a synthesis of the gradual growth of telepsychology in Australia. It identifies factors that hinder the development of telepsychology and outlines the main arguments for developing this as a model for the provision of psychology across remote and **rural** Australia. The authors draw on their own recent experiences in developing collaborative telepsychology services to make recommendations for the future of telepsychology in Australia.  2014 National Rural Health Alliance Inc.

1. **Therapeutic alliance in videoconferencing psychotherapy: A review**
Psychotherapy services are limited in remote and **rural** areas in Australia and across the globe. Videoconferencing has become well established as a feasible and acceptable mode of psychological treatment delivery. Therapeutic alliance (TA) is an essential factor underlying successful therapy across therapeutic models. In order to determine the state of knowledge regarding TA in psychotherapy via videoconferencing, a literature review was conducted on research studies that formally measured TA as primary, secondary or tertiary outcome measures over the past 23 years. The databases searched were Medline, PsycArticles, PsycINFO, PsycEXTRA and EMBASE. Searching identified 9915 articles that measured satisfaction, acceptability or therapeutic rapport, of which 23 met criteria for the review. Three studies were carried out in Australia, 11 in USA, 4 in Canada, 3 in Scotland and 2 in England. Studies overwhelmingly supported the notion that TA can be developed in psychotherapy by videoconference, with clients rating bond and presence at least equally as strongly as in-person settings across a range of diagnostic groups. Therapists also rated **high** levels of TA, but often not quite as **high** as that of their clients early in treatment. The evidence was examined in the context of important aspects of TA, including bond, presence, therapist attitudes and abilities, and client attitudes and beliefs. Barriers and facilitators of alliance were identified. Future studies should include observational measures of bond and presence to supplement self-report.  2014 National Rural Health Alliance Inc.

2. **The Use of Telehealth by Medical and Other Health Professional Students at a College Counseling Center**
Most college counseling centers do not utilize telehealth despite evidence of positive outcomes. The aim of this study was to examine the telehealth experience of students in a college counseling center. Participants were health professional students who utilized at least one telehealth visit between November 2015 and April 2017 (N=67). Methods: In June 2017, the authors administered a telehealth survey that assessed access, experience, effectiveness, and impact on therapeutic alliance. Of 67 students, 36 (53.7%) responded. The majority reported telehealth was convenient (34, 94.4%), time-saving (34, 94.4%), and helped them to feel better (30, 83.3%). Over half used telehealth because of distance (20, 55.5%). Eighty-one percent reported telehealth as being as good, nearly as good, or no different than meeting in person. Conclusion: Telehealth is a viable option for college counseling centers and is experienced as convenient, time-saving, and effective with little negative impact on therapeutic alliance.  2018,  2018 Taylor & Francis.

3. **Telepsychiatry in Asperger's syndrome**
Background Internet technology offers psychiatrists new opportunities for remote interaction with patients. It also raises issues regarding therapeutic effectiveness, safety, technical problems and possibilities for overcoming them, and matters related to specific mental health problems such as autism. The case presented concerns an adolescent male with severe social impairment and isolation as manifestations of Aspergers syndrome.Methods The patient was accepted contact with psychiatric services through telepsychiatry, which enabled initial assessment and the development of a therapeutic relationship.Results In due course the patient was able to attend the clinic in person. He became somewhat reconciled to his family. With appropriate adaptations he was able to resume his education and career.Conclusions Telepsychiatry shows promise in engaging with patients with autism spectrum disorders. As experience accrues, there is some evidence that it is safe and effective. Adaptations to traditional clinical psychotherapy may be required.  College of Psychiatrists of Ireland 2017.

Insulin autoimmune syndrome (IAS)is an uncommon cause of spontaneous **hypoglycemia** from hyperinsulinemia due to autoantibodies against endogenous **insulin** (Jian-Ping Chu, 2016). These individuals have no prior exposure to exogenous insulin. We **report** a **case** of a 35-year-old African American male, who presented to Vaughn Regional Medical Center in Selma, AL, after he was found to have seizures from hypoglycemia, with a blood sugar of 63 on presentation. He was never diagnosed with diabetes in the past, nor did he have a history of seizure disorder. He continued to be hypoglycemic during the initial period of his hospital stay. His fasting **insulin** level was 27 mIU/l (normal is less than 25, with presence of **insulin** autoantibodies (IAA), and a negative workup otherwise.

Objective: A growing number of **health** information technologies (HIT) are being developed and tested to address **mental** **health** conditions. HIT includes Internet and smartphone programs or apps, text messaging protocols and telepsychiatry. We reviewed the promise and evidence that HIT can expand **access** to **mental** **health** **care** and reduce disparities in use of **services** across groups in need. Conclusions: Limited reach of **mental** **health** **services** is a pervasive problem in the United States, and solving it will require innovations that enable us to extend our clinical reach into underserved populations without significantly expanding our workforce. In theory, HIT can extend **access** to **mental** **health** **care** in several ways: by enhancing the reach to priority populations, addressing system capacity issues, supporting training, improving clinical decision making, lowering the "consumer's threshold" for treatment, delivering preventive **mental** **health** services, speeding innovation and adoption and reducing cost barriers to treatment. At present, evidence is limited, and research is needed, focusing on consumer engagement strategies, the benefits and harms of HIT for the therapeutic relationship and the comparative effectiveness of various HIT alternatives.  2013 Elsevier Inc.

Background: Mental capacity based mental health legislation has been proposed, but its potential impact on practice has not been described. Aims: To describe the extent to which mental capacity based law might change prescriptions of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in England and Wales. Method: A qualitative study using focus groups and semi-structured interviews of psychiatrists, was followed by a cross sectional study of 186 consultant psychiatrists. Results: Psychiatrists were divided in their management of detained but apparently competent patients refusing ECT. From the cross sectional survey, 15.9% reported having prescribed ECT in such patients, but some expressed views that the treatment was not acceptable under these circumstances. Conclusions: Mental capacity based legislation could limit the use of compulsory treatment to some individuals refusing treatment. However, it might equally lead to psychiatrists redefining their operational definitions of mental capacity. Declaration of **interest:** This study was funded by the Department of Health.

1. **Resident Evaluation of a Required Telepsychiatry Clinical Experience**
Objective: The authors explored resident experiences of telepsychiatry clinical training. This paper describes an analysis of evaluation forms completed by psychiatry residents following a required training experience in telepsychiatry. Methods: Retrospective numeric and narrative data were collected from 2005 to 2012. Using a five-point Likert-type scale (1 = strongly disagree and 5 = strongly agree), residents ranked the session based on the following characteristics: the overall experience, **interest** in participating in telepsychiatry in the future, understanding service provision to underserved areas, telepsychiatry as mode of service delivery, and the unique aspects of telepsychiatry work. The authors also conducted a content analysis of narrative comments in response to open-ended questions about the positive and negative aspects of the training experience. Results: In all, 88 % of residents completed (n = 335) an anonymous evaluation following their participation in telepsychiatry consultation sessions. Numeric results were mostly positive and indicated that the experience was interesting and enjoyable, enhanced **interest** in participating in telepsychiatry in the future, and increased understanding of providing psychiatric services to underserved communities. Narrative data demonstrated that the most valuable aspects of training included the knowledge acquired in terms of establishing rapport and engaging with patients, using the technology, working collaboratively, identifying different approaches used, and awareness of the complexity of cases. Resident desire for more training of this nature was prevalent, specifically a wish for more detail, additional time for discussion and debriefing, and further explanation of the unique aspects of telepsychiatry as mode of delivery. Conclusions: More evaluation of telepsychiatry training, elective or required, is needed. The context of this training offered potential side benefits of learning about interprofessional and collaborative care for the underserved.  2015 Academic Psychiatry. EID: 2-s2.0-84959335862
2. **Telemedicine interest for routine follow-up care among neurology patients in Arkansas**
Background: Teleneurology in Arkansas has been used primarily for management of acute stroke with a state-funded hub-and-spoke model allowing physicians at rural hospitals to access vascular neurologists in time to facilitate tissue plasminogen activator administration. Routine neurologic care has been provided only in small pilot studies. We wished to determine patient **interest** in participating in teleneurology for routine follow-up visits as well as demographic and **medical** factors associated with interest. Materials and Methods: New and established patients of the Neurology Outpatient Clinic at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) were surveyed between March 2011 and December 2012 to assess their **interest** in participating in teleneurology as well as potential factors associated with their interest. Results: Of 1,441 respondents, 52.4% were interested in telemedicine. Of those interested versus uninterested in telemedicine, respectively, 68.9% versus 36.32% traveled more than 1 h to the clinic, 64.7% versus 35.3% had difficulty secondary to neurological conditions, 22.6% versus 6.8% had missed **medical** appointments due to travel problems, and 43.1% versus 9.4% had travel-imposed financial hardship. Conclusions: Telemedicine **interest** for routine follow-up visits was strong among patients at the UAMS Neurology Outpatient Clinic. Factors positively associated with **interest** included long travel distances, travel expenses, and transportation difficulties. These results suggest that implementing a telemedicine program for follow-up visits would be acceptable to neurology patients for routine ongoing care.  Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2016.

3. **Connecting to the future: Telepsychiatry in postgraduate medical education**
Objective: This study characterized and examined factors influencing psychiatry residents' and fellows' interest, exposure, and future plans to use telepsychiatry. Subjects and Methods: A 17-item electronic survey was distributed to 485 psychiatry residency and fellowship programs in the United States. Each program director or administrator was asked to voluntarily distribute the survey to his or her trainees. Chi-squared tests were performed to test differences in proportions. Stepwise multivariate logistic regression was used to model outcomes of interest. Results: In total, 283 respondents completed the survey. A majority of respondents were interested in telepsychiatry and felt that it was an important part of training. Of the 50 respondents who had clinical exposure to telepsychiatry and completed the survey, most reported that their experience increased their **interest** level, and two-thirds reported having either a one-time encounter or less than 6 h of multiple patient experiences via telepsychiatry. Clinical exposure to telepsychiatry was significantly related to level of training (p=0.001) and program location (p=0.005). Residents in their postgraduate year (PGY) 4 or fellowship were 2.6 times more likely to be exposed to clinical telepsychiatry than PGY 1-3 residents (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.41-4.95). Residents and fellows in rural programs were 4.3 times more likely to be exposed than those in urban or suburban settings (95% CI 1.07-17.28). Factors affecting trainees' plans to use telepsychiatry in their future practice include program location (p=0.013) and **interest** level (p<0.001). Residents and fellows in rural locations were 9.3 times more likely to report future plans to use telepsychiatry (95% CI 1.88-45.71). Conclusions: There is a practice gap between resident **interest** and resident exposure to telepsychiatry. Training programs should consider incorporating a brief telepsychiatry experience to fulfill both resident **interest** and the growing demand for psychiatrists.  2013, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

4. **Choosing psychiatry as a career: Motivators and deterrents at a critical decision-making juncture**
Objective: To examine factors influencing the choice of psychiatry as a career between residency program application and ranking decision making. Methods: Using an online questionnaire, applicants to the largest Canadian psychiatry residency program were surveyed about the impact of various factors on their ultimate decision to enter psychiatry residency training. Results: Applicants reported that patient-related stigma was a motivator in considering psychiatry as a career, but that negative comments from colleagues, friends, and family about choosing psychiatry was a deterrent. Training program length, limited treatments, and insufficient clerkship exposure were noted as deterrents to choosing psychiatry, though future job prospects, the growing role of neuroscience, and diagnostic complexity positively influenced choosing psychiatry as a specialty. Research and elective time away opportunities were deemed relatively unimportant to ranking decisions, compared with more highly weighted factors, such as program flexibility, emphasis on psychotherapy, service-training balance, and training program location. Most applicants also reported continuing to fine tune ranking decisions between the application and ranking submission deadline. Conclusions: Stigma, exposure to psychiatry, diagnostic complexity, and an encouraging job market were highlighted as positive influences on the choice to enter psychiatry residency. Interview and information days represent opportunities for continued targeted recruitment activity for psychiatry residency programs. EID: 2-s2.0-84905994899

We used an in-depth needs assessment to identify specific skills required for the practice of effective telepsychiatry, and provide an evidence base to guide the development of telepsychiatry curricula in postgraduate psychiatry training. Many of these skills set telepsychiatry apart from practice in traditional face-to-face clinical settings, or result from adaptations to clinical practice to meet the needs of a telepsychiatry interface in patient care. Methods: We used a qualitative, modified grounded theory approach to gain insight into areas of importance for telepsychiatry training in postgraduate psychiatry residency. 16 interviews of faculty and residents (9 and 7 interviews, respectively), allowed participants to reflect on their experiences in telepsychiatry. Data were then thematically analyzed. Results: Interview respondents identified important aspects of the context for telepsychiatry training; the skills required to competently practice telepsychiatry; and the desired teaching and learning methods for acquiring these skills. Specific domains of competency were identified: Technical skills; assessment skills; relational skills and communication; collaborative and interprofessional skills; administrative skills; medico-legal skills; community psychiatry and community-specific knowledge; cultural psychiatry skills, including knowledge of Indigenous cultures; and, knowledge of health systems. The skills identified in this study map well to competency- based **medical** education frameworks. Conclusions: Telepsychiatry is increasingly being adopted as a solution to health systems problems such as regional disparities in access to care, and it requires explicit competency development. Ensuring adequate and quality exposure to telepsychiatry during residency training could positively impact our health systems and health equity.  2016 Crawford et al. EID: 2-s2.0-84956888493
6. **Addiction and technology: Plus a change plus c'est la mme (The more things change, the more they remain the same)**
Excessive use of the internet for gambling, gaming and behavioural addiction, are a focus of contemporary interest. The authors delve into the archives to explore the connections between the growth of various forms of technology, commerce, addictive behaviours and responses of the State, in colonial India. The interplay between the growth of the telegraph network in 19th century India, and its influence on various forms of gambling, including speculation on opium prices, and the rain, as a theme of wager make interesting stories, as do the governmental responses to these. Clinical and social responses to information technology raised much the same concerns as they do now.  2017 Indian Journal of Psychiatry | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.

0. **Telepsychology: A Primer for Counseling Psychologists **
Telepsychology is having a profound influence on professional practice. Currently, however, many psychologists lack the requisite knowledge and skill to provide ethical and competent telepractice services. Moreover, the **field** has lagged in developing the educational and supervised experiences required to achieve competency. Yet, there is great opportunity as well. The purpose of this article is to identify the natural integration of the pillars of counseling psychology with the **major** domains of telepractice and to link telepractice to the values and **mission** of counseling psychologists. We present aspects of telepsychology including ethical and legal factors, asynchronous and synchronous practice, and group-focused practice along with technologies and the rules that govern them. We also describe interjurisdictional practice, and introduce a proposed curriculum based upon the benchmark competencies for infusion of telepsychology into training across the professional lifespan.

1. **Online counseling: An exploratory survey of Italian psychologists attitudes towards new ways of interaction**
Objective: Online counseling may be defined as an interaction between users and mental health professionals that takes place through computer mediated communication technology. This study aimed to investigate the attitudes of Italian psychologists towards different aspects of online counseling provided via email, chat, forums, and videoconference. Method: An online questionnaire was administered to a sample of 289 licensed psychologists in the Veneto Region (Italy) in order to collect opinions, preferences, and intentions to use online modalities, along with prior knowledge and practice experiences. Results: Only 18.3% of the respondents had previous experience with online counseling. Overall, the majority of psychologists (62.6%) were favorable towards online counseling, but they also had several reservations about the provision of online diagnosis and therapeutic interventions. Results showed a consistent lack of clarity regarding ethical and penal issues concerning online modalities. Conclusions: More efforts must be directed to deepening the application of new technologies in the **field** of psychology in order to enable an ethical and professional practice of online counseling in Italy.  2017,  2017 Society for Psychotherapy Research.

2. **Twenty-First Century Ethical Challenges for Psychology**
Foreseeable social and technological changes will force us to reevaluate our thinking about ethically appropriate ways to fulfill our **mission** of using psychology to advance human health and welfare in the twenty-first century. Three categories of challenge related to societal and technological changes have become particularly evident. First, increasing patterns of delivering services over substantial distances by electronic means (i.e., telepsychology) demand consideration. Second, we must parse our ethical obligations to individuals, to groups, and to society at large as our influence working behind the scenes as "invisible" psychologists grows. Finally, as we witness the accelerating demise of psychiatry, we must take care not to follow a similar path. As we face new ethical challenges, we must continually ask ourselves where our responsibilities lie as individuals and as a profession. We must learn not to repeat the mistakes of the past and focus instead on optimizing the future for a science and practice of psychology focused on human health and welfare.  2007 American Psychological Association.

0. **Reactions of psychiatric patients to telepsychiatry**
Telepsychiatry could offer a viable medical service to remote or isolated social communities if it does not generate adverse reactions such as delusional ideation, particularly in patients in settlements without adequate exposure to mainstream culture and internet. We examined subjective reactions to telepsychiatry of randomly selected 84 psychiatric patients from remote locations in Ontario, Canada. They rated the quality of their teleconferencing sessions via 10 item questionnaire and were asked about advantages and disadvantages of telepsychiatry. The majority of patients indicated that they were able to communicate as if physically **present** (92.9%) and were comfortable with telepsychiatric service (95.2%). They found the sessions as beneficial as direct meetings with their psychiatrist (84.5%) and would use this service again (98.8%). There were no instances of telepsychiatry being associated with adverse reactions in patients from remote communities with inadequate exposure to modern mainstream culture and internet.  R.

Forensic assessment videoconferencing (VC) is gradually gaining popularity among forensic mental health practitioners. Given the profound impacts of the characteristics of VC on forensic assessment destined for courts, knowledge of and familiarity with the salient features of the technology and its application in forensic assessment is relevant so as to obviate any potential negative impact. The **present** study examines some issues as well as practice considerations that may **help** forensic psychologists enhance the results of forensic assessments conducted with VC technology. Discussions and suggestions on how to advance forensic assessment via VC are offered. Copyright  Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. EID: 2-s2.0-84930885227
2. **Attitudes Toward Psychological Telehealth: Current and Future Clinical Psychologists' Opinions of Internet-Based Interventions**
Objectives: The current study explored differences in acceptance of telehealth interventions amongst currently licensed and future clinicians with a focus on web camera-based intervention. The influence of theoretical orientation was also assessed. Method: An online survey assessed 717 participants comprising 409 licensed psychologists (40.8% female, mean age = 56.57, standard deviation [SD] = 11.01) and 308 doctoral-level students (78.9% female, mean age = 27.66, SD = 5.9) across domains of endorsement and rejection. Results: Binary logistic regression indicated no significant difference between currently licensed and future psychologists in their endorsement of telehealth modalities. Cognitive-behavioral, cognitive, behavioral, and systems psychologists were significantly more accepting of telehealth interventions than were dynamic/analytic or existential therapists. Conclusions: Increasing exposure to telehealth through education as well as continued research on efficacy for specific diagnoses may **help** psychologists to more effectively determine whether telehealth is the "best fit" for both clinician and client.  2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

0. **A Promising New Strategy to Improve Treatment Outcomes for Patients with Depression**
Each year, ineffective medical management of patients with mental illness compromises the health and well-being of individuals, and also impacts communities and our society. A variety of interrelated factors have impeded the health system's ability to treat patients with behavior health conditions adequately. A key contributing factor is a lack of objective markers to help predict patient response to specific drugs that has led to patterns of "trial and error" prescribing. For many years, clinicians have sought objective data (eg, a laboratory or imaging test) to assist them in selecting appropriate treatments for individual patients. Electroencephalogram (EEG) findings coupled with medication outcomes data may provide a solution. "Crowdsourced" physician registries that reference clinical outcomes to individual patient physiology have been used successfully for cancers. These techniques are now being explored in the context of behavioral health care. The Psychiatric EEG Evaluation Registry (PEER) is one such approach. PEER is a clinical phenotypic database comprising more than 11,000 baseline EEGs and more than 39,000 outcomes of medication treatment for a variety of mental health diagnoses. Collective findings from 45 studies (3130 patients) provide compelling evidence for PEER as a relatively simple, inexpensive predictor of likely patient response to specific antidepressants and likely treatment-related side effects (including suicidal ideation).

1. **Using telepsychiatry to enrich existing integrated primary care**
Background: Integrated care is characterized by evolving heterogeneity in models. Using telepsychiatry to enhance these models can increase access, quality, and efficiencies in care. Introduction: The purpose of this report is to describe the process and outcomes of adapting telepsychiatry into an existing integrated care service. Materials and Methods: Telepsychiatry was implemented into an existing integrated care model in a high-volume, urban, primary care clinic in Colorado serving patients with complex physical and behavioral needs. Consultative, direct care, educational/training encounters, provider-to-provider communication, process changes, and patient-level descriptive measures were tracked as part of ongoing quality improvement. Results: Telepsychiatry was adapted into the existing behavioral health services using an iterative team meeting process within a stepped care model. Over 35% of the requests for psychiatry services were medication related-and medication changes (type/dose) were the most frequent referral outcome of psychiatric consultation. Forty percent of patients in the service had multiple behavioral health diagnoses, in addition to physical health diagnoses. Discussion: Telehealth will become an increasingly necessary component in building hybrid/blended integrated care teams. Examples of flexible model implementation will **support** clinics in tailoring effective applications for their unique patient panels. Conclusions: An adapted integrated care model leveraging telepsychiatry is successfully serving the complex deep end of a primary care patient population in Colorado. Lessons learned in implementing this model include the importance of team attitudes.  2019, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. EID: 2-s2.0-85071183030
2. **Using virtual week to assess prospective memory in younger and older adults**
Prospective memory (PM) is the ability to perform future intention. Older adults often present dysfunctions in PM tasks and investigating the nature of their difficulties have critical implication for their indipendent living. Virtual Week is a computer based program that simulate real week activities. Participants also performed executive functions tasks to investigate which abilities are involved in PM. Virtual Week has shown to be suitable instrument to evaluate PM performance with important implications on assessment and rehabilitation of PM dysfunctions.  2012 Interactive Media Institute.

3. **Informed collaboration in health care: An embedded-cases study in geriatric telepsychiatry**
Telemedicine, the delivery of medical consultation and services, is enabled by information and communications technologies. Participants in telemedicine consultation services (ie, clinicians, patients, and other parties) use video conferencing, special-purpose software and/or hardware, and data and notes from electronic medical records and other systems to formulate effective treatment plans. Telemedicine is a particular mode of informed collaborationinformation and communications technologysupported collaborative activity in which collaborators rely (wholly or in part) on digitally stored information retrieved from various sources to pursue their collective objectives. We report on an embedded-cases study of a long-running geriatric telepsychiatry clinic in the north-eastern United States. Our analysis draws on the theory of distributed cognition (DCog) to explicate the ways in which information and cognitive effort are distributed across individuals and artefacts to **support** psychiatric consultation from a distance and how these processes play out over time in routines. On the basis of this case study, we offer a refinement of DCog theory, focusing on four interrelated dynamic processes that, we propose, act as critical enablers of informed collaboration: cognitive offloading, visibility of action, intersubjective understanding, and knowledge redundancy. We discuss practical implications for designing telemedicine services and tools, and we offer suggestions for further research on informed collaboration.  2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd EID: 2-s2.0-85052650861
4. **School-Based Telepsychiatry in an Urban Setting: Efficiency and Satisfaction with Care**
Background and Introduction: Given the shortage of child psychiatrists in most areas, telepsychiatry may increase accessibility of psychiatric care in schools, in part by improving psychiatrists' efficiency and reach. The current study assessed consumer and provider satisfaction with school-based telepsychiatry versus in-person sessions in 25 urban public schools and compared the efficiency of these service delivery models. Materials and Methods: In total, 714 satisfaction surveys were completed by parents, students, school clinicians, and child psychiatrists following initial (26.3%) and follow-up (67.2%) visits (6.4% did not indicate type of visit). Most of these surveyed visits were for medication management (69.9%) or initiation of medication (22%). Efficiency analyses compared time saved via telepsychiatry versus in-person care. Researchers also conducted focus groups with providers to clarify preferences and concerns about telepsychiatry versus in-person visits. Results: Consumers were highly satisfied with both in-person and telepsychiatry-provided school psychiatry services and showed no significant differences in preference. Providers reported both in-person and telepsychiatry were equally effective and showed a slight preference for in-person sessions, citing concerns about ease of video equipment use. Telepsychiatry services were more efficient than in-person services, as commute/setup occupied about 28 psychiatrist hours total per month. Discussion and Conclusions: Findings suggest that students, parents, and school clinicians perceive school-based telepsychiatry positively and equal to on-site care. Child psychiatrists have apprehension about using equipment, so equipment training/preparation and provision of technical **support** are needed. Implications of study findings for telepsychiatry training and implementation in schools are discussed.  2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2020. EID: 2-s2.0-85077861024
5. **A Two-Tiered Strategy for Preventing Complications of Bereavement in the First Thirteen Months Post-Loss: A Pilot Study Using Peer Supports with Professional Therapist Back-up**
This feasibility and acceptance pilot study for preventing complications of bereavement within the first year post loss recruited 20 adult grievers within 9 months of becoming bereft and assigned consenting subjects to peer supporters trained by a non-profit bereavement **support** organization for weekly or bi-weekly telephone-based peer **support** until month 13 post-loss. Subjects who met DSM-5 criteria for major depressive disorder or showed an Inventory of Complicated Grief (ICG) score exceeding 19, 6 months or more post loss, were assigned to 12 to 16 weeks of interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) with an experienced therapist. Eight and six subjects completed the protocol assigned to peer **support** and IPT, respectively, with pre/post Patient Health Questionnaire-9 scores of 5.38 (2.45) versus 3.25 (4.13) (p = 0.266) and 16.67 (7.17) versus 8.40 (5.73) (p =0.063); and pre/post ICG scores of 12.50 (4.72) versus 5.00 (2.51) (p = 0.016) and 35.17 (5.12) versus 8.4 (5.73) (p = 0.063).

7. **Telepsychiatry clinical decision support system used by non-psychiatrists in remote areas: Validity & reliability of diagnostic module**
Background & objectives: A knowledge-based, logically-linked online telepsychiatric decision **support** system for diagnosis and treatment of mental disorders was developed and validated. We evaluated diagnostic accuracy and reliability of the application at remote sites when used by non-psychiatrists who underwent a brief training in its use through video-conferencing. Methods: The study was conducted at a nodal telepsychiatry centre, and three geographically remote peripheral centres. The diagnostic tool of application had a screening followed by detailed criteria-wise diagnostic modules for 18 psychiatric disorders. A total of 100 consecutive consenting adult outpatients attending remote telepsychiatry centres were included. To assess inter-rater reliability, patients were interviewed face to face by non-specialists at remote sites using the application (active interviewer) and simultaneously on online application via video-conferencing by a passive assessor at nodal centre. Another interviewer at the nodal centre rated the patient using Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) for diagnostic validation. Results: Screening sub-module had high sensitivity (80-100%), low positive predictive values (PPV) (0.10-0.71) but high negative predictive value (NPV) (0.97-1) for most disorders. For the diagnostic sub-modules, Cohens kappa was >0.4 for all disorders, with kappa of 0.7-1.0 for most disorders. PPV and NPV were high for most disorders. Inter-rater agreement analysis revealed kappa >0.6 for all disorders. Interpretation & conclusions: Diagnostic tool showed acceptable to good validity and reliability when used by non-specialists at remote sites. Our findings show that diagnostic tool of the telepsychiatry application has potential to empower non-psychiatrist doctors and paramedics to diagnose psychiatric disorders accurately and reliably in remote sites.  2017, Indian Council of Medical Research.

8. **Reaching rural Ohio with intellectual disability psychiatry**
Individuals with intellectual disability experience higher rates of mental illness when compared with the general population, and there is a lack of medical and mental health professionals in **rural** and under-served areas. With the increase in discharge of individuals from institutional settings **back** to their home communities into the least restrictive environments, there are more patients with complex needs being added to the schedules of physicians in the outpatient delivery care system. Patients with disabilities may not travel well or tolerate changes in routine so may not have access to psychiatry. Utilization of telepsychiatry is well suited to this specialized patient population because it allows a highly traumatized group to meet with a psychiatrist and other mental health professionals from a location of their choice. Ohios Telepsychiatry Project for Intellectual Disability was initiated in 2012 to serve outlying communities with a lack of infrastructure and resources, to provide specialized mental health services to individuals with co-occurring mental illness and intellectual disability. After five years, over 900 patients with intellectual disability from 64 of Ohios 88 counties receive specialized mental health treatment through this statewide grant-funded project.  2017, The Author(s) 2017.

This article discusses the **background** and history of the Association of State and Provincial Psychology Board's (ASPPB) Principles and Standards for Telepsychology. The Principles/Standards are described with comments on each one as they apply to the practice of telepsychology, and with a guide on how they coordinate with the American Psychological Association's Guidelines for the Practice of Telepsychology. Further, barriers to the interjurisdictional practice of telepsychology are reviewed and a proposed solution to them is presented. The ASPPB psychology interjurisdictional compact, known as the PSYPACT is in process of being introduced as an effective vehicle for addressing these barriers.  2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

10. **Women's use of online resources and acceptance of e-mental health tools during the perinatal period**
Objectives The women's professional help-seeking rate for perinatal depression is low, despite the prevalent and disabling nature of this condition. Therefore, new approaches should be implemented to increase women's access and utilization of treatment resources, namely e-mental health tools. This study aimed to characterize women's current pattern of use of online resources for mental heal issues and women's acceptance of e-mental health tools during the perinatal period, and to investigate its main determinants. Methods This study used an online cross-sectional survey that was completed by 546 women during the perinatal period. Results 31.3% had prior knowledge of websites targeting mental health illness. Women presenting an actual need for help (i.e., a positive screen for depression) reported greater use of online resources and greater engagement in e-health behaviors related to mental health (d=0.460.61), and being more accepting of e-mental health tools, particularly of informative websites. Women's perceptions concerning the e-mental tools were found to predict their intentions to use them. Conclusions The results seem to globally **support** Portuguese women's acceptance of e-mental health tools. To improve the level of acceptance, women should be involved as stakeholders in the development of new e-mental health tools and provided with specific information before their utilization.  2016 EID: 2-s2.0-84982824306
11. **Decision support in addiction: The development of an e-health tool to assess and prevent risk of fatal overdose. The ORION Project**
Background and objective: The application of e-health technology to the field of substance use disorders is at a relatively early stage, and methodological quality is still variable. Few have explored the extent of utilization of communication technology in exploring risk perception by patients enrolled in substance abuse services.The Overdose RIsk InfOrmatioN (ORION) project is a European Commission funded programme, aimed to **develop** and pilot an e-health psycho-educational tool to provide information to drug using individuals about the risks of suffering a drug overdose. Methods: In this article, we report on phase 1 (risk estimation), phase 2 (design), and phase 3 (feasibility) of the ORION project. Results: The development of ORION e-health tool underlined the importance of an evidence-based intervention aimed in obtaining reliable evaluation of risk. The ORION tool supported a decision making process aimed at influencing the substance users' self-efficacy and the degree to which the substance users' understand risk factors. Therefore, its innovative power consisted in translating risks combination into a clear estimation for the user who will then appear more likely to be interested in his/her risk perception. Conclusion: Exploratory field testing and validation confirmed the next stage of evaluation, namely, collection of routine patient samples in study clinics. The associations between risk perception of overdose, engagement with the ORION tool and willingness to alter overdose risk factors, in a clinical setting across various EU member states will further confirm the ORION tool's generalisability and effectiveness.  2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

12. **Towards learning organisations with telemedicine**
For the post-industrial society, the knowledge and information society, learning is an important activity. We speak about learning organisations and even a learning society. In healthcare dissemination of knowledge may be a tool for improving patient care. Working with telemedicine has been proposed to result in learning, but research on this is limited. To investigate learning in telemedicine a study was performed with qualitative interviews of 30 persons working with telepsychiatry, teledermatology, a telepathology frozen-section service, and teleotolaryngology. The results clearly show that working with telemedicine provides learning. More than 80% of the respondents revealed that they had learnt something new by using telemedicine and had improved their knowledge of their specialty as well as other areas. All GPs said they had learnt something new, as well as nurses, psychologists, other categories of personnel, and even medical specialists. When all within psychiatry report that they have learnt something new the future learning potential of telemedicine looks promising for psychiatry. Two-thirds of the respondents could not tell that the learning made them perform tasks for which they previously needed assistance, but the answers may have been dependent on the type of telemedical work and the educational **background** of the respondents. Two-thirds of the respondents thought that something more could be done in telemedical work to promote their own learning, which shows the clear potential for learning by telemedicine. To start working with telemedicine initial instruction seems to be sufficient; a more extensive training programme appears unnecessary. In future with many applications of telemedicine implemented, healthcare organisations may become important arenas for learning and leaders will have to focus on learning.

13. **Telepsychiatry in a Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Service**
Objectives: To carry out a survey on the use of video conferencing equipment by a **rural** child psychiatric multidisciplinary team and to determine what impact the introduction of this equipment had on service provision. Method: Several aspects were studied including user satisfaction and estimations of cost saving, on the basis of avoidance of travel to and from the regional base in Galway. A questionnaire was also developed to determine whether alternative contact would have been made if if this new technology were not in place. Results: The results of the initial six months following commencement were investigated. Use of the equipment was attempted 17 times during this period. Most members of the child psychiatry team participated in its use. Visual problems accounted for 66.7% of reported technical difficulty and 88.9% of users rated their level of satisfaction with the equipment as 'Satisfied' or 'Very Satisfied'. Conclusions: Apart from the start-up cost implications of installing this equipment, it satisfied its aim of increasing contact between the **rural** service and St Anne's Children Centre in Galway. The equipment was easy to use and for the most part reliable. EID: 2-s2.0-33750492301

15. **Developing telepsychiatry services in kwazulu-Natal - an action research study**
Objective: In 2009, the Departments of Psychiatry and Telehealth of the University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN) initiated a three year project to **develop** telepsychiatry services in KwaZulu-Natal. This paper describes the challenges and opportunities of this project. Method: This was a collaborative, in situ health service project and an action research framework was adopted. Over the three years, following a needs assessment and an e-health Readiness Assessment, two action research cycles were completed. Cycle 1: The preparation, implementation and evaluation of educational material, technical requirements and clinical guidelines and clinical **support** materials. Cycle 2: Preparation and evaluation of educational and clinical outreach sessions. Results: Videoconference education sessions were beneficial to health staff without post-qualification psychiatry training. A flexible format for education improved knowledge outcomes. Clinical sessions are feasible, but require administration and technical **support** for facilitation. With facilitator training, 128Kbps is a suitable bandwidth for education but 384Kbps is preferred for clinical consultation. Conclusion: Telepsychiatry offers tremendous potential to facilitate the three strategies suggested by the World Psychiatric Association to address the treatment gap, save time and costs and improve access to the small pool of specialist psychiatrists in resource constrained environments.

16. **The case of telepsychiatry adoption and diffusion in a healthcare organization in New Zealand**
This research investigated telemedicine adoption and usage in psychiatry in one hospital in New Zealand (NZ). This research utilized the technological innovations theories as a guiding theoretical framework to **develop** a set of determinants of telemedicine adoption in healthcare organizations. The research looked at two stages in the case study concerning the adoption process of telemedicine, utilizing the video conferencing technology (TMVC). Prior to TMVC adoption, the findings suggested that TMVC was adopted according to its relative advantage and cost effectiveness, along with other facilitating factors such as image enhancement. None of the deterringfactors seemed to impede the adoption decision of TMVC. Results from the post-adoption stage suggested that TMVC was used minimally in the case study. The superficial assessment of important factors such as complexity and compatibility, prior to TMVC adoption, further suggested this weakness. In comparison with the literature, the incompatibility of TMVC in psychiatry stood as a unique cultural identifier pertaining to TMVC adoption in the NZ case study. Copyright  2006, Idea Group Inc.

17. **Tailored online cognitive behavioural therapy with or without therapist support calls to target psychological distress in adults receiving haemodialysis: A feasibility randomised controlled trial**
Background Psychological distress is prevalent in haemodialysis (HD) patients yet access to psychotherapy remains limited. This study assessed the feasibility and acceptability of online cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) tailored for HD patients, with or without therapist support, for managing psychological distress. Methods This feasibility randomised **controlled** trial recruited patients from a UK HD centre. Following psychological distress screens, patients with mild-moderate psychological distress (Patient Health Questionnaire PHQ-9; score: 519 and/or Generalised Anxiety Disorder; GAD-7 score: 514) who met remaining inclusion criteria were approached for consent. Consenters were individually randomised (1:1) to online-CBT or online-CBT plus three therapist **support** calls. Outcomes included recruitment, retention, and adherence rates. Exploratory change analyses were performed for: psychological distress, quality of life (QoL), illness perceptions, and costs. The statistician was blinded to allocation. Results 182 (44%) out of 410 patients approached completed psychological distress screens. 26% found screening unacceptable; a further 30% found it unfeasible. Psychological distress was detected in 101 (55%) patients, 60 of these met remaining inclusion criteria. The primary reason for ineligibility was poor computer literacy (N = 17, 53%). Twenty-five patients were randomised to the supported (N = 18) or unsupported arm (N = 7); 92% were retained at follow-up. No differences in psychological distress or cost-effectiveness were observed. No trial adverse events occurred. Conclusion Online CBT appears feasible but only for computer literate patients who identify with the label psychological distress. A definitive trial using the current methods for psychological distress screening and online care delivery is unfeasible. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02352870  2017 Elsevier Inc.

18. **A meta-analysis of the effectiveness of individually oriented Cognitive Behavioral Treatment (CBT) for severe aggressive behavior in adolescents**
This meta-analysis, including six studies (13 effect sizes) and 164 adolescents, examined the effectiveness of individually oriented treatment (which means that the intervention contained at least an individual component, possibly in combination with group and/or family therapy) with CBT-elements for adolescents with severe aggression problems. A large and homogeneous overall effect size was found (d=1.139) indicating consistency across studies. The included studies examined the effect of three interventions, namely, mode deactivation therapy (MDT; four studies), stress-inoculation therapy (1), and the cell-phone program (1). This multilevel analysis demonstrated that only few individually oriented interventions have been developed and evaluated, while four of the included studies used a weak research design. Effective individually tailored interventions for youths with severe aggression problems (who are unsuitable for group treatment) are scant. There may be added value if group interventions are supplemented with more individually tailored evidence-based interventions.  2014,  2014 Taylor & Francis. EID: 2-s2.0-84914147813
19. **A telepsychiatry model to support psychiatric outreach in the public sector in South Africa**
The access of **rural** Mental Health Care Users in South Africa to specialist psychiatrists and quality mental health care is currently sub-optimal. Health professionals and planners working in psychiatry lack a well-defined and feasible outreach model to facilitate the delivery of services to remote and **rural** areas. In response to this challenge, a three-year action research telepsychiatry study was undertaken by the Departments of Psychiatry and TeleHealth at the University of KwaZulu-Natal, to **develop** a telepsychiatry outreach model based on local research and international evidence. The Model draws on needs and infrastructure assessments of the designated psychiatric hospitals in the province, a review of the published international evidence on telepsychiatry and videoconference-based education, and an evaluation of local clinical and educational telepsychiatry implementations in KwaZulu-Natal. The Model proposed is "virtual", i.e. not bound to provincial or district referral patterns, aims not to add to the burden on the current workforce and is intended to be integrated into psychiatry outreach services and policy. The Model should be subjected to in situ testing for validation and implementation. It is hoped that an implementation of this Model will improve the access of Mental Health Care Users to specialist psychiatry care. EID: 2-s2.0-84870978861
20. **Satisfaction with long-distance motivational interviewing for problem drinking**
OBJECTIVES: To examine the relationship between participant preference and satisfaction with live interactive video, telephone, or face-to-face motivational interviewing sessions with problem drinkers. METHODS: Participants completed a satisfaction questionnaire after each motivational interviewing counseling session utilizing an abbreviated Likert scale. The participants were asked what mode they would have preferred, their satisfaction with their counselor, and their satisfaction with overall counseling. RESULTS: When asked to choose a long-distance mode of communication, televideo was preferred more than 2:1 over telephone. Also those with televideo experience were significantly more likely to choose televideo as a preferred long-distance mode of choice. CONCLUSIONS: Findings **support** the acceptability of 2 forms of long-distance communication, telephone and televideo, which might reasonably be studied in the future in **rural** areas (with some preference for televideo) to reduce heavy drinking and alcohol-related problems.  2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

21. **Agreement on web-based diagnoses and severity of mental health problems in norwegian child and adolescent mental health services**
Objective: This study examined the agreement between diagnoses and severity ratings assigned by clinicians using a structured web-based **interview** within a child and adolescent mental health outpatient setting. Method: Information on 100 youths was obtained from multiple informants through a web-based Development and Well-Being Assessment (DAWBA). Based on this information, four experienced clinicians independently diagnosed (according to the International Classification of Diseases Revision 10) and rated the severity of mental health problems according to the Health of the Nation Outcome Scales for Children and Adolescents (HoNOSCA) and the Children's Global Assessment Scale (C-GAS). Results: Agreement for diagnosis was K=0.69-0.82. Intra-class correlation for single measures was 0.78 for HoNOSCA and 0.74 for C-GAS, and 0.93 and 0.92, respectively for average measures. Conclusions: Agreement was good to excellent for all diagnostic categories. Agreement for severity was moderate, but improved to substantial when the average of the ratings given by all clinicians was considered. Therefore, we conclude that experienced clinicians can assign reliable diagnoses and assess severity based on DAWBA data collected online.  Brndbo et al; Licensee Bentham Open.

22. **A comparison of mental health diagnoses treated via interactive video and face to face in the veterans healthcare administration**
Objective: This study compares the mental health diagnoses of encounters delivered face to face and via interactive video in the Veterans Healthcare Administration (VHA). Materials and Methods: We compiled 1 year of national-level VHA administrative data for Fiscal Year 2012 (FY12). Mental health encounters were those with both a VHA Mental Health Stop Code and a Mental Health Diagnosis (n=11,906,114). Interactive video encounters were identified as those with a Mental Health Stop Code, paired with a VHA Telehealth Secondary Stop Code. Primary diagnoses were grouped into posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, psychosis, drug use, alcohol use, and other. Results: In FY12, 1.5% of all mental health encounters were delivered via interactive video. Compared with face-to-face encounters, a larger percentage of interactive video encounters was for PTSD, depression, and anxiety, whereas a smaller percentage was for alcohol use, drug use, or psychosis. Conclusions: Providers and patients may feel more comfortable treating depression and anxiety disorders than substance use or psychosis via interactive video.  2015, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

23. **Feasibility and promise of a remote-delivered preconception motivational interviewing intervention to reduce risk for alcohol-exposed pregnancy**
Background: Alcohol-exposed pregnancy (AEP) is a leading cause of birth defects. Effective face-to-face preconception interventions based on motivational interviewing (MI) exist and should be translated into remote formats for maximum public health impact. This study investigated the feasibility and promise of a one-session, remote-delivered, preconception, MI-based AEP intervention (EARLY Remote) for non-treatment-seeking community women. Subjects and Methods: This was a single-arm, prospective pilot intervention study. All participants received the intervention via telephone and mail. Feasibility of remote-delivery methods, treatment engagement, treatment credibility, MI treatment integrity, and therapeutic alliance were examined. Outcomes were 3- and 6-month drinks per drinking day (DDD), rate of unreliable contraception, and proportion of women at risk for AEP due to continued risk drinking and no or unreliable contraception use. Results: Feasibility of remote delivery was established; participants were engaged by the intervention and rated it as credible. Integrity to MI and therapeutic alliance were good. Both DDD and rate of unreliable contraception decreased significantly over time. Proportions of women who drank at risk levels, used unreliable or no contraception, and/or were at risk for AEP in the past 90 days decreased significantly from baseline to 6 months. Conclusions: Remote delivery was feasible, and the translated remote intervention may reduce AEP risk. Refinement of EARLY Remote may facilitate its placement within a spectrum of effective MI-based preconception AEP interventions as part of a stepped-care approach. EARLY Remote may have an important role within a stepped-care model for dissemination to geographically disperse women at risk for AEP. This could result in substantial public health impact through reduction of AEP on a larger scale.  Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. EID: 2-s2.0-84899780736
24. **Development of a novel diagnostic system for a telepsychiatric application: A pilot validation study**
Background: A net-based, decision **support** system for diagnostic assessment and management of psychiatric disorders, developed as part of a telepsychiatry service, which aims to deliver mental health care to underserved population of remote areas in India is described. This paper presents the development and preliminary results of diagnostic validation of the application, intended for use among adult patients. The bilingual (English and Hindi) diagnostic tool consists of a core diagnostic section comprising a screening sub-module and criteria-based diagnostic sub-modules for 18 adult psychiatric disorders, and additional sections covering **background** information. The diagnostic tool of the application was examined among 100 consecutive consenting adult outpatients, by comparing it with detailed semi-structured clinical assessments led by a consultant psychiatrist, on accuracy of diagnoses generated, and examining the feasibility of its use. Results: The screening sub-module had high sensitivity and high specificity, low positive predictive values, but high negative predictive values for most disorders. For the diagnostic sub-modules, there was moderate (kappa = 0.4-0.6), to substantial agreement (kappa > 0.6) between diagnoses generated by the tool and consultants' diagnoses, for all the disorders except dysthymia. Sensitivity was high barring a few disorders. Specificity was high for all the disorders, positive predictive values were acceptable to high for most disorders, and negative predictive values were consistently high. Completion rate was 100%; average time taken was five minutes for screening alone, and 30 minutes for complete assessment with screening and criteria-based evaluation. A majority of the patients, their relatives, and interviewers were satisfied with the interview. Conclusions: The preliminary results indicated that despite some limitations, the new diagnostic system was reasonably comprehensive, time-efficient and feasible, with an acceptable level of diagnostic accuracy. Hence, it appeared to be suitable for use as a telepsychiatric application.  2014 Malhotra et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd. EID: 2-s2.0-84906923585
25. **Teleconsultation and Training of VHA Providers on Transgender Care: Implementation of a Multisite Hub System**
Background: The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is piloting a national program providing teleconsultation and training to clinicians to increase knowledge and comfort with treating transgender veterans and to expand clinical capacity. This program is based on Project ECHO and uses specialist expertise to train and educate front-line clinicians. Over time, the front-line clinicians increase knowledge and skills, enabling them to provide care locally and obviate need for patient travel. This program is innovative in its national scope, interdisciplinary team model, and multihub structure. This article describes development of the program and initial results for the first cohort of learners. Materials and Methods: Five interdisciplinary clinical teams participated in the 14-session, 7-month program. Most teams had some experience treating transgender veterans prior to participation. Results: The teams completed at least 12 of 14 sessions. Thirteen of 33 participants completed an evaluation. In general, respondents found the teleconsultation program very helpful and credited the experience with improving their team functioning. Furthermore, respondents reported a significant increase in confidence to treat transgender veterans by the end of the program (59% versus 83%). We explored whether it is possible to recruit VHA clinical teams to participate in lengthy training on a low prevalence but complex condition. Conclusions: Early results **support** the feasibility and effectiveness of this national VHA teleconsultation and training program for transgender care. Lessons learned from the first group of learners have been applied to two concurrent groups with positive results.  Copyright 2015, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2015. EID: 2-s2.0-84948766201
26. **Cost savings of telemedicine utilization for child psychiatry in a rural Kansas community**
The costs of pediatric telemedicine services remain underreported and understudied; however, there is evidence that telepediatric services can be cost competitive with traditional ones. For 15 years, the University of Kansas Center for Telemedicine and Telehealth has been providing telemental health outreach from the University of Kansas Medical Center (KUMC). One service site is located in Crawford County, Kansas, which provides telepsychiatry services to children and adolescents. The purpose of this study was to examine the costs of operating the Crawford County site relative to accessing services at KUMC, the likely alternative service location. The cost of travel time to parents who accompanied a dependent to either location also was estimated. Patients and parents were examined over a 6-month period in 2006. One hundred thirty-two patients received 257 telemedicine psychiatric consultations during this period. Cost estimates for using the pediatric telemedicine service were assessed for all patients; however, travel and related costs were collected from a sample of 26 patient-parent dyads. The estimated costs of services were obtained using standard cost-accounting procedures. An average cost per consultation in Crawford County was $168.61. The cost savings in travel time and other expenses to parents and patients were substantial between use of the county site and KUMC. Subtracting average savings in travel costs to patients and parents produced an average cost of a telepsychiatry consult in Crawford County of only $30.99. This study was conducted over 6 months with a small number of observations; it should be replicated over a longer study period, with more patients, and with more data that might capture marginal costs of services.

27. **A videophone psychosocial intervention for dementia caregivers**
Background/Objectives: Available services and intervention programs for dementia caregivers are often underutilized because of issues such as cost, logistics, lack of knowledge about available services, or insufficient **support** from others. Information technologies offer the potential of removing these barriers and facilitating the ability of caregivers to access needed support. This project evaluated the feasibility and efficacy of technologybased psychosocial intervention among minority family caregivers of dementia patients. Design: A feasibility and efficacy trial. Setting: Participants' homes in the Greater Miami Community. Participants: One hundred ten (56 Hispanic American and 54 African American) caregivers of patients with dementia. Intervention: A technologybased multi-component psychosocial intervention was delivered in-home and via videophone technology over 5 months. The intervention wasmodeled after the REACH II intervention and targeted known areas of caregiver risk. Measurement: Standardized measures of depression, caregiver burden, social support, and the caregivers' perception of the caregiver's experience were administered at baseline and 5 months postrandomization. Results: Overall, caregivers who received the intervention reported a decrease in burden, an increase in perceived social **support** and positive perceptions of the caregiving experience. No effect was observed for depression. Most participants indicated that the intervention improved their caregiving skills and found the technology to be easy to use. Conclusions: A technology-based format was feasible for delivering a multi-component intervention to minority family dementia caregivers. The intervention improved caregiver outcomes for both Hispanic and African American caregivers. The results suggest that technology may help eliminate disparities in access to caregiver intervention programs.  2013 American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry. EID: 2-s2.0-84888644123
28. **Delivery of evidence-based psychotherapy via video telehealth**
There has been increasing interest in using video telehealth to deliver evidence-based psychotherapies (EBPs). Telehealth may have numerous advantages over standard in-person care, including decreasing patients' and providers' costs and increasing system coverage area. However, little is known regarding the effectiveness of EBPs via video telehealth. This review had two goals, including a review of the existing literature and ongoing research on using video telehealth technologies to deliver EBPs as well as an informal survey of telehealth experts to discuss the special considerations and challenges present in adapting practices to video telehealth. Together, findings suggest that telehealth practices could represent an important component of the future of psychotherapy and clinical practice, especially in dissemination and implementation of EBPs in traditionally underserved areas and populations.  2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York (outside the USA).

29. **Resisting and promoting new technologies in clinical practice: The case of telepsychiatry**
New telecommunications technologies promise to profoundly change the spatial and temporal relationship between health professional and patient. This paper reports results from an ethnographic study of the introduction of a videophone or telemedicine system intended to facilitate faster and more convenient referral of patients with anxiety and depression in primary care, to a community mental health team. We explore the reasons for contest over the telemedicine system in practice, contrasting professionals critique of the technology in play with a more fundamental problem: the extent to which the telecommunications system threatened deeply embedded professional constructs about the nature and practice of therapeutic relationships.

30. **Bipolar disorder and PTSD screening and telepsychiatry diagnoses in primary care**
Objective: To describe clinical diagnoses from telepsychiatrist consultation in safety net primary care settings for adult patients screening positive for bipolar disorder, PTSD, or both. Methods: Patients were administered the PTSD Checklist (PCL-6) and the Composite International Diagnostic Interview 3.0 (CIDI) for bipolar disorder. Positive screening result definitions were PCL-6 score of 14 and CIDI positive stem question responses and score of 8. Patient characteristics were assessed by survey. Psychiatrists consulted in primary care via telehealth and recorded clinical diagnoses. Results: Among 767 patients attending consultation with a telepsychiatrist, 495 (65%) screened PCL-6 positive only, 249 (32%) screened both PCL-6 and CIDI positive, and 23 (3%) screened CIDI positive. Approximately two-thirds screening PCL-6 positive were diagnosed with PTSD, and most had comorbid mood disorder diagnoses, with bipolar disorder diagnosis occurring more often in those screening CIDI positive compared to negative (42% vs. 15%). Positive predictive values were 64.9% for PCL-6 and 43.8% for CIDI. Conclusion: Most individuals screening positive for PTSD and/or bipolar disorder had two or more psychiatric diagnoses; misclassification exists for both instruments but was greater for CIDI. Psychiatrist consultation early in treatment for individuals screening positive on the PCL-6 and/or CIDI could help clarify diagnoses and improve treatment planning.  2020 The Authors EID: 2-s2.0-85084993436
31. **Disagreement in satisfaction between patients and providers in the use of videoconferences by depressed adults**
Aim: To evaluate whether there was a difference in satisfaction scores between providers and patients in the use of videoconferences (VCs) by depressed adults. Method: This study was a subanalysis of the joint European project, MasterMind, and participants were recruited from 15 pilot studies in 11 different countries. The Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ)-3 was used as assessment tool, and scores were summed to give total scores. The questionnaire consists of three items evaluating general satisfaction, fulfillment of needs in treatment, and usability. Results: A total of 362 respondents, 201 patients and 161 providers, completed the questionnaire. Providers had a mean total CSQ-3 score of 9.17 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 8.90-9.45), whereas patients had a mean of 9.70 (95% CI = 9.44-9.98). Mean scores for item 1 (the extent to which VCs had met the needs of the participants): Patients 3.19, providers 2.93 (p = 0.00048); for item 2 (general satisfaction): Patients 3.22, providers 3.08 (p = 0.083); and item 3 (whether participants wanted to use VCs again): Patients 3.28 providers 3.16 (p = 0.045). Conclusion: The results showed that total satisfaction scores were higher in patients than in providers. The differences between patients and providers were significant for items 1 and 3 (p < 0.05), but we did not find a significant difference regarding item 2.  2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

32. **Evaluating Telehealth Websites for Information Consistent with APA Guidelines for Telepsychology**
The authors evaluated websites offering therapeutic telehealth services (N = 55) using a 38-item checklist based on the American Psychological Associations Guidelines for the Practice of Telepsychology (APA Guidelines) to determine the extent that online service providers included such information on their websites. On average, the websites reviewed addressed only 39% of the checklist criteria. These findings are disconcerting and suggest most providers websites do not include information that would help potential clients make informed decisions about online treatment. The authors urge more providers to consider offering telehealth services to increase the supply of qualified providers in response to growing consumer demand.  2019,  2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

33. **The importance of external clinical facilitation for a perinatal and infant telemental health service**
Introduction: Clinical facilitation is an established strategy for introducing innovation into clinical practice. The Queensland Centre for Perinatal and Infant Mental Health has used clinical facilitation to establish a telehealth service to **support** perinatal and infant mental health in regional, **rural** and remote areas of the Australian state of Queensland. The aim of this study is to explore the role of clinical facilitation in implementing and sustaining the telehealth service. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 14 remote-site users of the telehealth service. Interviews were analysed using thematic analysis. Results: Two dominant themes emerged: unmet need and service visibility. The study confirms the usefulness of telehealth as a way to address unmet need for specialist mental health services in regional, **rural** and remote areas. The study also provides evidence that a telehealth service with intermittent demand requires a consistent clinical facilitator, to keep the service visible to remote-site clinicians and maintain awareness of the service as a referral option. Conclusion: Previous research has identified the importance of clinical facilitation in initial service implementation. This study demonstrates the necessity of clinical facilitation for ongoing service provision. Facilitation is likely to be more important where the telehealth service responds to intermittent or infrequent clinical need, compared with high-volume services where clinics are conducted routinely.

34. **Telepsychiatry and patient-provider concordance**
Context: Telepsychiatry has become a common modality for the provision of psychiatric consultations to patients in **rural** regions. Aims: The aims of this study were to assess and compare patient and provider satisfaction and perceptions of access to care with telepsychiatry. Methods: Telepsychiatric consultations were given by providers based on an urban tertiary academic health centre to patients located in **rural** primary care clinics. Results: Patients (n = 110) and providers (n = 10) were both highly satisfied with telepsychiatry and both believed that telepsychiatry provided patients with better access to care. Paired patient and provider survey results demonstrated a high level of concordance between patients and provider responses. Conclusions: Concordance between patient and provider satisfaction may contribute to adherence and positive treatment outcomes. These results provide **support** for the use of telepsychiatry consultations to improve patient access to psychiatric care in **rural** regions.Contexte: La tlpsychiatrie est maintenant une modalit courante de prestation de services psychiatriques aux patients vivant en rgions rurales. Objectifs: Cette tude avait pour objectif d'valuer et de comparer la satisfaction et la perception des patients et des fournisseurs de soins quant  l'accs aux soins par l'entremise de la tlpsychiatrie.

35. **Evaluating the diagnostic agreement between telepsychiatry assessment and face-to-face visit: A preliminary study**
Objective: Despite accumulated evidence that demonstrates clinical outcome of telepsychiatry is comparable with conventional method; little research has been done on telepsychiatry in developing countries. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic agreement between telepsychiatry assessment and face-to-face assessment. Moreover, patient and doctor satisfaction was assessed by self-report questionnaire. Method: This study was conducted in an inpatient department of a university-affiliated hospital in Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Iran. The study sample consisted of 40 inpatients aged over 18 years who were selected from October 2016 to February 2017. All patients were visited once by face-to-face conventional method and once by interactive video teleconsultation by 2 psychiatric consultants. Results: Results of this study revealed that the diagnostic agreement between the 2 interviewers was 75%. Moreover, about 85% of the patients preferred telepsychiatry for follow-up visits. Also, more than 82% of the patients would recommend telepsychiatry to others although 95% of them perceived contact via telepsychiatry as uncomfortable to some extent. Conclusion: Telepsychiatry service can be used for psychiatric evaluation in Iran, and it has a desirable effect on patient and doctor satisfaction. The results of this study showed the capacity of moving towards using telepsychiatry.  2020 Korean Cancer Association. All rights reserved. EID: 2-s2.0-85083399092
36. **The small-world of cybertherapy**
Is cybertherapy a scientific paradigm? Is it made up of heterogeneous individuals or an organized scientific community? How has it evolved since 2006? To answer these questions, we took an interest in the keywords used in the scientific literature dealing with cybertherapy. A network approach has been put forward in order to (1) highlight the most central concepts, (2) to make some themes emerge, (3) to determine whether this structure could testify to a small-world organization, revealing paradigmatic aspects of a scientific discipline. 1510 articles have been extracted from the Pubmed and Elsevier databases from the query:  cybertherapy  OR "computer based therapy" OR "online therapy" OR "tele-psychology" OR "telepsychotherapy" OR  tele-mental health ". Over the period considered, (i) the conceptual network appears coherent and organized (S = 3.28), (ii) 18 themes emerge, (iii) the anxious disorders seem particularly central. The analysis of the temporal evolution shows an increase in the number of keywords which, combined with a reduction in the number of themes, makes possible to circumscribe the cybertherapy more than to promote its scattering. Although still above 3, the S-smallworld index decreases from year to year. All the results **support** an exemplary cybertherapeutic paradigm. However, the decline in the small world index over time invites us to ensure that this scientific coherence remains at the risk of a scattering of cybertherapy that could lead to an impoverishment of its identity. Ethical, methodological and educational implications are considered.  2017, Interactive Media Institute. All rights reserved. EID: 2-s2.0-85043790267
37. **Cybertherapy: A scientific model? A text mining analysis of published abstracts**
In the field of cybertherapies, meta-analysis reveal the scientific advancement in different fields, such as virtual reality exposure therapy for anxiety disorders [1] or the effect of immersive technology on user presence [2]. Certainly, knowledge about a phenomenon depends on results. But, following a socioconstructivist approach [3], it seems obvious that these results also depend on the researchers intentionality, which fluctuates with social, cultural, economic, political or theoretical circumstances. Researchers implicit models [4] also impact the design of the studies, the results and consequently, the scientific representation of the investigated phenomenon. One way to assess scientific models is to study publications abstracts. In order to observe the scientific models in cybertherapies and their evolution, we analyzed 857 abstracts from indexed Pubmed publications, obtained in January 2016 with the following requests: cybertherapy OR computer based therapy OR online therapy OR web based therapy OR telepsychology OR telepsychotherapy OR tele-mental health ". Following data-mining methods [5], we combined (a) classical approaches in lexicometry [6], [5], (b) the  Meaning Extraction Method  [7] and (c) network analyses [8]. We also crossed data with publications dates to observe the evolution of the concepts. Results will help us to observe the evolution of scientific models in cybertherapies as well as the evolution of concepts such as emotions or intersubjectivity.  2016 by Interactive Media Institute.

38. **Acute laryngeal dystonia: A persisting psychiatric emergency**
Objective: Acute laryngeal dystonia is one of the most life-threatening medication side effects in psychiatry. It is rare and predominately caused by the use of antipsychotics in at-risk individuals. Within days of a patient's initial presentation, several antipsychotics can be administered for the purposes of acute sedation and ongoing pharmacotherapy. In this case report, we describe a 27-year-old at-risk male, who developed acute laryngeal dystonia in the context of antipsychotic polypharmacy. Conclusion: Clinicians should take into account recent sedation and ongoing antipsychotic use in patients at risk of developing acute laryngeal dystonia. Awareness of this condition and prompt treatment with parenteral anticholinergic medication can be lifesaving.  The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists 2016.
