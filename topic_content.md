0. **Remote consultations in the era of COVID-19 pandemic: Preliminary experience in a regional Australian public acute mental health care setting**
In the wake of the recent **pandem**ic of Corona Virus **Diseas**e 2019 (**COVID-19**), with confirmed cases having crossed 750,000, health systems across the **world** are getting overwhelmed; making it strenuous to maintain essential health services. Several changes were implemented in our acute **mental health car**e service using a collaborative approach to maintain a balance between preventive measures to flatten the curve and to provide care to those who were in need. Mode of service delivery was changed predominantly to tele-medicine, amongst others. It was found to be a workable model, albeit further follow up will be required to better understand its viability and feasibility to withstand **the COVI**D-19 cataclysm.  2020 eid: 2-s2.0-85083013026

0. **Emergency Department Telepsychiatry Service Model for a Rural Regional Health System: The First Steps**
Background: **Emerg**ency **depart**ments (EDs) have recognized an increasing number of patients presenting with mental health (MH) concerns. This trend imposes greater demands upon EDs already operating at capacity. Many ED providers do not feel they are optimally prepared to provide the necessary MH care. One consideration in response to this dilemma is to **use** advanced telemedicine technology for psychiatric consultation. Introduction: We examined a **rural**-and community-based health system operating 21 EDs, none of which has direct access to psychiatric consultation. Dedicated beds to MH range from zero (in EDs with only 3 beds) to 6 (in an ED with 38 beds). Materials and Methods: We conducted a needs assessment of this health system. This included a survey** of e**mergency room providers with a 67% response rate and site visits to directly observe patient flow and communication with ED staff. A visioning workshop provided input from ED staff. Data were also obtained, which reflected ED admissions for the year 2015. Results: The data provide a summary of provider concerns, a summary of MH presentations and diagnosis, and age groupings. The data also provide a time when most MH concerns present to the ED. Discussion: Based upon these results, a proposed model for delivering comprehensive r**egion**al emergency telepsychiatry and behavioral health services is proposed. C**onclu**sions: Emergency telepsychiatry services may be a tenable solution for addressing the shortage of psychiatric consultation to EDs in light of increasing demand for MH treatment in the ED.  2019, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-85059896853

0. **Use of Reimbursed Psychology Videoconference Services in Australia After Their Introduction: An Investigation Using Administrative Data**
Background: In November 2017, the Australian government approved reimbursement for psychology consultations conducted by **videoconfer**ence under the Better Access initiative to address inequitable access of mental health services across regions in Australia. Objective: This project **use**s publically available activity data from the Medicare Benefits Scheme to quantify the uptake** of videoco**nference for psychology resulting from the initiative change. Methods: Data were extracted from the Medicare Benefits Schedule item reports using the item codes for standard consultations and the new item co**des for vid**eoconference consultations. Activity data from 2 years before and the **first** year of the change to the Better Access initiative were compared to examine th**e uptake of** videoconference for psychology. Data were stratified by allied health profession, sex, age and state jurisdiction. Results: In the 1-year period after the introductio**n of reimbu**rsed videoconference consultations, approximately 5.7 million in-person con**sultations **and 4141 videoconference consultations were funded by** Medicare i**n Australia. Videoconference consultations comprised 0.07% of the total consultations performed in that 1-year period and showed an increased trajectory. The results can guide future research into evaluating the clinical outcomes of pati**ents via bo**th in-person and videoconferen**ce delivery** modes. Conclusions: Videoconference mental health services w**ere** used in **the f**irst year that they were available, although they only accounted for a small percentage of all mental health consultations provided by allied health professionals. This finding lays the foundation for future work which could examine the effectiveness of the scheme in reducing inequity and investigating the economic benefits of the expanded initiative to the government and society.  2019 ISPORThe professional society for health economics and outcomes research eid: 2-s2.0-85073756466

Objective: This project **use**s publically available activity data from the Medicare Benefits Scheme to quantify the uptake** of videoco**nference for psychology resulting from the initiative change. Methods: Data were extracted from the Medicare Benefits Schedule item reports using the item codes for standard consultations and the new item co**des for vid**eoconference consultations. Activity data from 2 years before and the **first** year of the change to the Better Access initiative were compared to examine th**e uptake of** videoconference for psychology. Data were stratified by allied health profession, sex, age and state jurisdiction. Results: In the 1-year period after the introductio**n of reimbu**rsed videoconference consultations, approximately 5.7 million in-person con**sultations **and 4141 videoconference consultations were funded by** Medicare i**n Australia. Videoconference consultations comprised 0.07% of the total consultations performed in that 1-year period and showed an increased trajectory. The results can guide future research into evaluating the clinical outcomes of pati**ents via bo**th in-person and videoconferen**ce delivery** modes. Conclusions: Videoconference mental health services w**ere** used in **the f**irst year that they were available, although they only accounted for a small percentage of all mental health consultations provided by allied health professionals. This finding lays the foundation for future work which could examine the effectiveness of the scheme in reducing inequity and investigating the economic benefits of the expanded initiative to the government and society.  2019 ISPORThe professional society for health economics and outcomes research eid: 2-s2.0-84878954346

Objective: We aimed to determine characteristics of patients receiving **Medicar**e-funded face-to-face consultations by psychiatrists in a **rural** service with an established telemedicine service. Methods: For this study, 55 case-managed patients from f**our r**ural community mental health teams in South Australia provided information through questionnaires regarding psychological symptoms, quality of life, body mass index (BMI) and gave access to th**eir Med**icare data. Results: In a logistic regression, it was found that being younger was more likely associated** with a** Medicare psychiatric consultation (p<0.05). Participants with at least one recorded** visit **to a Medicare psychiatrist consultation also tended to have lower levels of psychological distress at the end of the 4-year period, have a higher BMI, and more general practitioner consultations.

0. **Effectiveness of an online CBT-i intervention and a face-to-face treatment for shift work sleep disorder: A comparison of sleep diary data**
In western societies, about one in six employees works in shifts. Shiftwork is associated with a number of poor somatic and psychological health outcomes, especially **sleep** issues. Higher rates of absenteeism and accidents in the workplace are possible consequences. Still, prevention programs and treatment options that are specifically tailored to shift-workers needs are rare. We devised a 4-week online **cognit**ive **behavior**al therapy for **insomnia** (CBT-I) intervention (n = 21) and compa**red s**leep outcomes to a face-to-face outpatient treatment for shift-workers (n = 12) **using** a sleep diary and **the E**pworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). In the online sample, measures also included the World Health Organization wellbeing questionnaire (WHO-5) and **the Inso**mnia Severity **Index** (ISI). In the outpatient sample, the Beck **Depress**ion Inventory (BDI-II), the Montgomerysb**erg Dep**ression Rating Scale (MADRS), and** the **Pittsburgh Sleep Qual**ity I**ndex (PSQI) were administered. Results showed signific**ant i**mprovements in sleep efficiency by 7.2% in the online sample and 7.7% in the outpatient sample. However, no significant difference was found in the** rate** of improvement in sleep efficiency across four weeks of treatment between the samples. In the online sample, the wellbeing (WHO**-5) and **insomnia symptoms (ISI) scores were significantly improved following the CBT-I intervention (p < 0.004 and p < 0.002 respectively). In the outpatient sample, symp**toms of** depression (BDI-II and MADRS **scores) **and insomnia symptoms (PSQI scores) improved significantly following the CBT-I intervention. In summary, C**BT-I **significantly improved sleep efficiency in both the online and outpatient samples, in addition to wellbei**ng, symp**toms of in**somnia,** and depression.

0. **Telephone-adapted Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction (tMBSR) for patients awaiting kidney transplantation**
Background Patients with progressive kidney disease experience increasing physiologic and psychosocial **stress**ors and declining health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Methods We conducted a randomized, active-controlled, open-label trial to test whether a **Mind**fulness-ba**sed St**ress ****Reduc**t**ion (MBSR) program delivered in a novel workshop-teleconference format wo**uld r**educe symptoms and improve HRQOL in patients awaiting kidney transplantation. Sixty-three transplant candidates were randomized to one of two arms: i) **telephon**e-adapted MBSR (tMBSR, an 8-week program of **medit**ation and yoga); or ii**) a tele**phone-based support group (tSupport). Participants completed self-report questionnaires at baseline, post-intervention, and after 6-months. Anxiety, measured by the **State**-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) post-intervention served as the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included: depression, sleep quality, pain, fatigue, and HRQOL assessed by SF-12 **Physic**al and Mental Component Summaries (PCS, MCS). Results 55 patients (age 54  12 yrs) attended their assigned program (tMBSR, n = 27; tSupport, n = 28). 49% of patients had elevated anxiety at baseline. Changes in anxiety were small and did not differ by treatment group post-intervention or at follow-up. However, tMBSR significantly improved mental HRQOL at follow-up: + 6.2 points on the MCS - twice the minimum clinically important difference (95% CI: 1.66 to 10.8, P = 0.01). A large percentage of tMBSR participants ( 90%) practi**ced **mindfulness and reported it help**ful fo**r stress management. Conclusions **Neit**her mindfulness training nor a support group resulted in clinically meaning**ful re**ductions in anxiety. In contrast, finding that tMBSR was more effective than tSupport for bolstering mental HRQOL during the wait for a kidney transplant is encouraging and warrants further investigation.

0. **The SAGES telephone neuropsychological battery: correlation with in-person measures**
Objective: **Neuropsycholog**ical **test** **batteri**es are administered **in person** to assess **cognit**ive function in both clinical and research settings. However, in-person administration holds a number of logistical challenges that makes it difficult to **use** in large or remote populations or for multiple serial assessments over time. The purpose of this descriptive study was to determine whether a telephone-administe**red neuropsych**ologi**cal **test battery correlated well with in**-per**son testing. Methods: Fifty English-speaking patients without dementia, over 70 years old, and part of a cohort of patients in a prospective cohort study examin**ing co**gnitive outcomes following elective surgery were enrolled in this study. Five well-va**lidated neurop**s**ycho**logical tests were administered by telephone to each participant by a trained interviewer within 24 weeks of the most recent in-pe**rson** interview. Tests included the Hopk**ins **Verbal Learning Test-Revised, Digit Span, Category Fluency, Phonemic Flu**ency**, and Boston Naming Test. A **Genera**l Cognitive Performance composite score was ca**lcul**ated from individual subtest scores as a Z-score. Results: Mean age was 74.9 years (SD = 4.1), 66% female, and 4% non-White. Mean and interquartile distributions of telephone scores were similar to in-person **scor**es. Correlation **analysi**s of test scores revealed significant correlations between telephone and in-pe**rson** results for each individual subtest, as well as for the overall composite score. A BlandAltman plot revealed **no b**ias or trends in scoring for either test administration type. Conclusions: In this descriptive study, the te**leph**one v**ersion of a ne**uropsychological test battery correlated well with the in-person version and may provide a feasible supplement in clinical and research applications.

0. **Treatment of Behavior Disturbances with Ketamine in a Patient Diagnosed with Major Neurocognitive Disorder**
A 77-year-old woman who had been previously diagnosed with a major neuro**cognit**ive disorder became highly agitated and aggressive in a long-term care facility. She did not respond to intramuscular (IM) haloperidol plus lorazepam and had to be transported to the local emergency department (ED). In the ambulance, she remained highly agitated and was given 200 mg IM ketamine. Within minutes of receiving this, she de-escalated dramatically with no apparent adverse effects and remained stable for several days. Although ketamine has been used recently in pre-hospital settings and EDs to reduce agitated behavior, there has been little if any investigation of its potential for reducing behavior disturbances in patients who suffer from major n**euroco**gnitive disorders. Ketamine could potentially be a promising treatment option for this population, but more research is needed.  2018 eid: 2-s2.0-85044665275

The **Child**rens Attention-deficit **Hyperact**ivity Disorder (ADHD) Telemental Health Treatment Study (CATTS) tested the hypotheses t**hat c**hildren and caregivers who received guideline-based treatment delivered through a hybrid telehealth service delivery model would experience greater improvements in outcom**es th**an children and caregivers receiving treatment via a comparison delivery model. Here, we present caregiver outcomes. 88 primary care providers (PCPs) in seven geographically underserved communities r**eferr**ed 223 children (ages 5.5  12.9years) to the randomized controlled trial**. Ove**r 22weeks, children randomized to the CATTS service delivery model received six sessions of telepsychiatry and six sessions of caregiver **behavior** management training provided in person by community therapists who were trained and s**uperv**ised remotely. Children randomized to the comparison Augmented Primary Care (APC) service model received management in primary care augmented by a single telepsychiatry consultation. Caregiver outcomes included changes in distress, as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), **Parent**ing Stress Index (PSI), Caregiver Strain Questionnaire (CSQ) and Family Empowerment Scale (FES). Caregivers completed five assessments. Multilevel mixed effects regression modeling tested for differences between the two service delivery models in caregiver outcomes from baseline to 25weeks. Co**mpare**d to caregivers of children in t**he AP**C model, caregivers of children in the CATTS service model showed statistically significantly greater improvements on the PHQ-9 ( = -1.41, 95% CI = [2.74, 0.08], p <.05), PSI ( = 4.59, 95% CI = [7.87,  1.31], p <.001), CSQ ( = 5.41, 95% CI = [ 8.58, 2.24], p <.001) and FES ( = 6.69, 95% CI = [2.32, **11.06**], p <.01).

Ove**r 22weeks, children randomized to the CATTS service delivery model received six sessions of telepsychiatry and six sessions of caregiver **behavior** management training provided in person by community therapists who were trained and s**uperv**ised remotely. Children randomized to the comparison Augmented Primary Care (APC) service model received management in primary care augmented by a single telepsychiatry consultation. Caregiver outcomes included changes in distress, as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), **Parent**ing Stress Index (PSI), Caregiver Strain Questionnaire (CSQ) and Family Empowerment Scale (FES). Caregivers completed five assessments. Multilevel mixed effects regression modeling tested for differences between the two service delivery models in caregiver outcomes from baseline to 25weeks. Co**mpare**d to caregivers of children in t**he AP**C model, caregivers of children in the CATTS service model showed statistically significantly greater improvements on the PHQ-9 ( = -1.41, 95% CI = [2.74, 0.08], p <.05), PSI ( = 4.59, 95% CI = [7.87,  1.31], p <.001), CSQ ( = 5.41, 95% CI = [ 8.58, 2.24], p <.001) and FES ( = 6.69, 95% CI = [2.32, **11.06**], p <.01). Improvement in child ADHD symptoms mediated improved caregiver scores** on t**he PSI and CSQ. Improvement in child **ODD beha**viors mediated caregiver CSQ scores. The CATTS trial supports the effectiveness of a hybrid telehealth service delivery model** for **reducing distress in caregivers of children with ADHD and suggests a mechanism through whichthe service model affected caregiver distress.  2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York. eid: 2-s2.0-82455179552

OBJECTIVE: There are few well-evaluated uncomplicated community-based interventions for **child**hood **aggress**ion. The authors assess the impact of a community-based **anger** management group on ch**ild agg**ressive **behavior**s, using a randomized, **control**led trial (RCT). METHOD: **Famili**es w**ith c**hildren 7 to 11 years old were recruited through advertisements and randomized (N = 123). Inclusion required parent concern abou****t a**nger**/aggress**ive beha**vior, RCT agreement, and a te**lephone **behavior screen. Intervention participants were offered three parent education/skill-building group sessions, 10** week**ly child group sessions, and three in-home family practice sessions. Nine groups ran from August 2002 to August 2004. Interviewers nave to randomization collected data on all participants pre- and postgroup. Outcom**es in**cluded chil**d-rat**ed anger and parent-**rated c**hild** aggress**ive behavior**, extern**alizing behavior and ho**stili**ty, parent-child relationship, and parenting stress. Intent-to-treat analyses were done. RESULTS: Pre/postoutcome comparisons indicated no significant differences between intervention ver**sus con**trol, with small effect sizes for most outcomes (0.27-0.29). Although not significant, the magnitude of improvement favored intervent**ion fa**milies on all parent-rated measures.

0. **Exploring the Telepsychiatry Experience: Primary Care Provider Perception of the Michigan Child Collaborative Care (MC3) Program**
Background: **Pediatr**ic mental healthcare is a growing component of primary care practice. However, there is a lack of access to mental health services, particularly those provided by **Child** and **Adolesc**ent Psychiatrists. The Michi**gan C**hild Collaborative Care (MC3) Program is a telepsychiatry service that offers embedded behavioral health consultants within primary care practices, telephonic consultation, video consultation and embedded care. Primary care provider (**PCP**) **util**ization of telepsychiatry services is predicated on perceiving the consultation service as user-friendly, **help**ful, and feasible in their practice. Objective: A survey** of** PCPs was conducted over a 5-year period to** as**sess PCP attitudes and perceptions regarding MC3 consultation, including measures of efficiency, user-friendliness, and confidence in providing mental healthcare. The survey contained 4 items, (2 quantitative and 2 qualitative), and took less than 2 minutes to complete. Results: 649 responses were received out of 1475 possible responses (44% response rate). Common themes elicited from the qualitative items included perception of improved patient care for **youth** with mental illness (45.3%), improved comfort and confidence in caring **for y**outh with mental illness (30.9%), greater comfort with the prescribing and monitoring of psychotropics (25.9%) and improved access to mental healthcare for you**th **(23.1%). PCPs strongly agreed that MC3 was user-friendly, efficient, and enhanced their confidence in manag**ing ped**iatric mental health concerns. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that the MC3 Telepsychiatry Program is w**ell** accepted by PCPs with self-reported improvements in providing mental healthcare to patients. Future research** sh**ould explore how** PC**P perception impacts PCP practice, knowledge, as well as outcomes for patients and families longitudinally.  2018 Academy of Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry eid: 2-s2.0-85051084783

0. **Mental health services for Nunavut children and youth: Evaluating a telepsychiatry pilot project**
Introduction: This study examines the delivery of psychiatric consultation services using videoconferencing technology to health and mental health workers in the Nunavut territory of Canada. The research provides insights into the TeleLink Mental Health Program and the delivery of professional-to-professional program consultations and continuing education seminars. Methods: Participant observation of 12 program consultations and four continuing education sessions was conducted. Individual interviews were conducted with the consulting psychiatrist and the lead program coordinator in Nunavut. As well, a focus group was held with Nunavut workers who participated in the televideo sessions. Results: The study found a number of factors that facilitated or hindered the process and content of a consultation-based telepsychiatry program and its effect on building capacity among frontline staff. Four main themes emerged related to the delivery of psychiatric services via televideo: gaining access, ensuring culturally appropriate services, providing relevant continuing education, and offering stable and confidential technology. Conclusions: Live interactive videoconferencing technology is an innovative and effective way of delivering specialized **mental health servic**es to professionals working in remote areas of Nunavut. Study results provide important strategies for expanding this approach to other jurisdictions in Nunavut and other Inuit regions.  T Volpe, KM Boydell, A Pignatiello, 2014. eid: 2-s2.0-84904618501

Methods: Study participants included 457 low-income clie**nts r**esiding in the medically underserved, geographically diverse Brazos Valley region of Texas. Clients completed the patient health questionnaire during their initial counseling appointment, which assessed **depress**ion s**everit**y and suic**ide i**deation in the 2 weeks prior to asses**sment.** Results: **Suici**de ideation was common among telemental health clients, with approximately 40% of clients in all demographic groups reporting some** recen**t though**ts of **suicide.

0. **Developing Telemental Health Partnerships Between State Medical Schools and Federally Qualified Health Centers: Navigating the Regulatory Landscape and Policy Recommendations**
Background: Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) deliver care to 26 million Americans living in underserved areas, but few offer tele**mental** health (**TMH**) services. The social missions of FQHCs and publicly funded state medical schools create a compelling argument for the development** of** TMH partnerships. In this paper, we share our **experi**ence and recommendations from la**unc**hing TMH partnerships between 12 **rural** FQHCs and 3 state medical schoo**ls. Ex**perience: There was consensus that med**ica**l school TMH providers should practice as part of the FQHC team to promote **integr**ation, enhance quality and safety, and ensure financial sust**ain**ability. For TMH providers to practice and bill as FQHC providers, the following issues must be addressed: (1) credentialing **and** privileging the TMH providers at the FQHC, (2) expanding FQHC Scope of **Project** to include telepsychiatry, (3) remote access to medical records, (4) insurance credentialing/paneling, billing, and su**ppleme**ntal payments, (5) contracting with the medical school, and (6)** in**demnity coverage for TMH. Recommendations: We make recommendations to both state medical schools and FQHCs about how to ov**erc**ome existing barriers to TMH partnerships. We also make recommendations about changes to policy that would mitigate the impact of these barriers. Specifically, we make recommendations to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid about insurance credentialing**, f**acility fees, eligibility of TMH encounters fo**r supp**lemental payments,** an**d Medicare eligibility rules for TMH billing by FQHCs. We also make recommendations to the Health Resources and Services Administration about restrictions on adding telepsychiatry to the FQHCs **Sco**pe** of Pro**ject and the eligibility of TMH providers for indemnity coverage under the Federal Tort Claims Act.  2018 The Authors.

0. **Alcohol abuse management in primary care: An e-learning course**
Background: The mental health knowledge gap challenges public health. The Alcohol Ab**use** Management in Primary Care (AAMPC) is an e-learning **cours**e designed to cover alcohol-related problems from the primary care perspective. The goal of this study was to verify if the AAMPC was able to enhance healthcare professionals' alcohol-related problems knowledge. Materials and Methods: One hundred subscriptions for the AAMPC were offered through the federal telehealth program. **The c**ourse was instructor-led and had nine weekly classes, delivered synchronously or asynchronously, at the students' convenience, using a varied array of learning tools. At the beginning, students took a test that provided a positive score, related to **critic**al knowledge for clinical management, and a **neg**ative score, related to misconceptions about alcohol-related problems. The test was repeated 2 month**s aft**er course completion. Results: Thirty-three students co**mplet**ed the course. The positive score improved significantly (p<0.001), but not **the** negative score. Students with previous ex**perie**nce with e-courses presented greater improvement on the positive score (p<0.036). Eighty-percent of the s**tuden**ts thought the course excelled in meeting its objectives. Web conferences and video and audio recordings were the most appr**eciat**ed learning tools. Course satisfact**ion** was negatively related to frequency of **Internet** access (Spearman's rho=-0.455, p=0.022). Conclusions: E-learning was highly appreciated as a learning tool, especially by students with the least frequency of Inter**net** use. Nonetheless, it worked better for those** prev**iously famil**iar w**ith e-courses. The AAMPC e-course provided effective knowledge transmission and retention. Complementary strategies to reduce misconceptions about alcohol-related problems must be **develop**ed for the training of primary care staff.

Students with previous ex**perie**nce with e-courses presented greater improvement on the positive score (p<0.036). Eighty-percent of the s**tuden**ts thought the course excelled in meeting its objectives. Web conferences and video and audio recordings were the most appr**eciat**ed learning tools. Course satisfact**ion** was negatively related to frequency of **Internet** access (Spearman's rho=-0.455, p=0.022). Conclusions: E-learning was highly appreciated as a learning tool, especially by students with the least frequency of Inter**net** use. Nonetheless, it worked better for those** prev**iously famil**iar w**ith e-courses. The AAMPC e-course provided effective knowledge transmission and retention. Complementary strategies to reduce misconceptions about alcohol-related problems must be **develop**ed for the training of primary care staff.

This study investigates the feasibility and effectiveness of providing telepsychiatry services to **Chines**e immigrants in a **nurs**ing **home**. The psychiatrist interviewed patients face-to-face for the initial consultation, and encouraged them to participate in this study to receive telepsychiatry-based follow-up visits. The feasibility and outcomes of telepsychiatry visits and satisfaction of the subjects, their families, and **the **nurs**ing **home **staff** were assessed. Nine monoling**ual Ch**inese immigrants, 8 women and 1 man, ranging from 54 to 88 years of age, were enrolled. The main reasons for psychiatric consultation were mood and behavioral problems. Eight of the 9 (88.9%) subjects participated in **videoconfer**ence follow-up visits, and 1 subject (11.1%) declined. Among the 8 subjects, 6 were referred for psychiatric intervention, 1 for differential diagnosis, and 1 for suicide assessment. At the end of the study, all 6 subjects referred for intervention had greatly improved; the subjects, their families, **and **the nurs**ing s**taff were highly satisfied with the telepsychiatry service. It is feasible to provide psychiatry consultations to ethnic immigr**ants** in a **nurs**ing home despite the fact that many of them are unfamiliar with the technology and suffer from dementia and psychotic symptoms.

0. **Telepsychotherapy for trichotillomania: A randomized controlled trial of ACT enhanced behavior therapy**
Despite its prevalence, quality treatment for trichotillomania is often difficult to find. The use of telepsychology has been an effective method for disseminating treatment services for a variety of mental health conditions. However, no research has examined the use of telepsychology to treat trichotillomania. This randomized controlled trial used Acceptance and **Commit**ment Therapy Enhanced Behavior Therapy delivered by way of telepsychology to treat trichotillomania in adults. The study compared an **act**ive treatment condition (n = 12) to a delayed treatment waitlist control condition (n = 10). Results showed significant reductions in hair pulling severity from pre- to post-treatment compared to the waitlist condition. The 22 participants all received treatment and were combined to examine overall treatment effects from pre-treatment to a 12-week follow-up. The effect of treatment on hair pulling severity remained significant at follow-up. Measures of psychological flexibility and perceived shame also saw significant improvement. Quality of **life**, however, did not improve over the course of treatment. The findings demonstrate that telepsychology is a viable option to disseminate treatment for trichotillomania.  2018 Elsevier Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-85046370384

0. **Study to promote innovation in rural integrated telepsychiatry (SPIRIT): Rationale and design of a randomized comparative effectiveness trial of managing complex psychiatric disorders in rural primary care clinics**
Objective: Managing complex psychiatric disorders like PTSD and **bipolar** disorder is challenging in Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) delivering care to U.S residents living in underserved rural areas. This protocol paper describes SPIRIT, a pragmatic comparative effectiveness trial designed to compare two approaches to managing PTSD **and bip**olar disorder in FQHCs. Interventions: Treatment comparators are: 1) Telepsychiatry Collaborative Care, which integrates consulting telepsychiatrists into primary care teams, and 2) Telepsychiatry Enhanced Referral, where telepsychiatrists and telepsychologists treat patients directly. Methods: Because Telepsychiatry Enhanced Referral is an adaptive intervention, a Sequential, Multiple Assignment, Randomized Trial design is used. Twenty-four FQHC clinics without on-site psychiatrists or psychologists are participating in the trial. The sample is patients screening positive for PTSD** and/or** **bipolar disord**er who are not already engaged in pharmacotherapy with a mental health specialist. Intervention fidelity is measured but not **control**led. Patient treatment engagement is measured but not required, and intent-to-treat analysis will be used. Survey questions measure treatment engagement and effectiveness. The Short-Form 12 Mental Health Component Summary (SF-12 MCS) is the primary outcome. Results: A third (34%) of those enrolled (n = 1004) are racial/ethnic minorities, 81% are not fully employed, 68% are Medicaid enrollees, 7% are uninsured, and 62% live in poverty. Mental health related quality of life (SF-12 MCS) is 2.5 standard deviations below the national mean. Discussion: We hypothesize that patients randomized to Telepsychiatry Collaborative Care will have better outcomes than those randomized to Telepsychiatry Enhanced Referral because a higher proportion will engage in evidence-based treatment.  2019 eid: 2-s2.0-85078769514

0. **Predicting post treatment client satisfaction between behavioural activation for depression delivered either in-person or via home-based telehealth**
Introduction: Treatment engagement, adherence, cancellations and other patient-centric data are important predictors of **treatment outcom**e. But often these data are only examined retrospectively. In this investigation, we analysed data from a clinical trial foc**use**d on innovative delivery of **depress**ion treatment to identify which patients are likely to prefer either in-home or in-person treatment based on pre-treatment characteristics. Methods: Patient satisfaction was assessed in a trial of individuals w**ith dep**ression treated using identical behavioural activation therapy protocols in person or through videoconferencing to the home (N = 87 at post treatment: 42 in-person and 45 in-home participants). The Client Satisfaction Questionnaire was administered at the end of the treatment. A Tobit regression model **was** used to assess moderation using treatment assignment. Regression lines were generated to model treatment satisfaction as a function of treatment assignment and to identify whether and where the groups intersected. We examined the distributions of the contributing moderators to the subsets of participants above and below the intersection point to identify differences. Results: While no significant differences in patient satisfaction were observed between the two groups, or between patients receiving treatment by different providers, baseline characteristics of the **sampl**e c**oul**d be used to differentiate those with a preference for traditional, in-office care from those preferring in-home care. Discussion: Participants who were more likely to prefer in-home care were characterized by larger proportions of veterans and lower-ranked enlisted service members. They also had more severe symptoms at baseline and less formal education. Understanding client reactions when selecting treatment modality may allow for a more satisfying patient experience.

2. **Exploring the relationship between the acceptability of an internet-based intervention for depression in primary care and clinical outcomes: Secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial**
Introduction: Treatment engagement, adherence, cancellations and other patient-centric data are important predictors of **treatment outcom**e. But often these data are only examined retrospectively. In this investigation, we analysed data from a clinical trial foc**use**d on innovative delivery of **depress**ion treatment to identify which patients are likely to prefer either in-home or in-person treatment based on pre-treatment characteristics. Methods: Patient satisfaction was assessed in a trial of individuals w**ith dep**ression treated using identical behavioural activation therapy protocols in person or through videoconferencing to the home (N = 87 at post treatment: 42 in-person and 45 in-home participants). The Client Satisfaction Questionnaire was administered at the end of the treatment. A Tobit regression model **was** used to assess moderation using treatment assignment. Regression lines were generated to model treatment satisfaction as a function of treatment assignment and to identify whether and where the groups intersected. We examined the distributions of the contributing moderators to the subsets of participants above and below the intersection point to identify differences. Results: While no significant differences in patient satisfaction were observed between the two groups, or between patients receiving treatment by different providers, baseline characteristics of the **sampl**e c**oul**d be used to differentiate those with a preference for traditional, in-office care from those preferring in-home care. Discussion: Participants who were more likely to prefer in-home care were characterized by larger proportions of veterans and lower-ranked enlisted service members. They also had more severe symptoms at baseline and less formal education. Understanding client reactions when selecting treatment modality may allow for a more satisfying patient experience.

Methods: Patient satisfaction was assessed in a trial of individuals w**ith dep**ression treated using identical behavioural activation therapy protocols in person or through videoconferencing to the home (N = 87 at post treatment: 42 in-person and 45 in-home participants). The Client Satisfaction Questionnaire was administered at the end of the treatment. A Tobit regression model **was** used to assess moderation using treatment assignment. Regression lines were generated to model treatment satisfaction as a function of treatment assignment and to identify whether and where the groups intersected. We examined the distributions of the contributing moderators to the subsets of participants above and below the intersection point to identify differences. Results: While no significant differences in patient satisfaction were observed between the two groups, or between patients receiving treatment by different providers, baseline characteristics of the **sampl**e c**oul**d be used to differentiate those with a preference for traditional, in-office care from those preferring in-home care. Discussion: Participants who were more likely to prefer in-home care were characterized by larger proportions of veterans and lower-ranked enlisted service members. They also had more severe symptoms at baseline and less formal education. Understanding client reactions when selecting treatment modality may allow for a more satisfying patient experience.

Introduction Telepsychiatry is defined as the **use** of information and communication technology (ICT) in providing remote psychiatric services. Telepsychiatry is applied using two types of communication: **synchron**ous (real time) and** **async**hron**ous (store and forward). Objective To determine the **cost**-effectivene**ss of a **synchronous and** an async**hronous telepsychiatric model in prison inmate patients with symptoms of depression. Method**s A **cost-effectiveness study was performed on a population consisting of 157patients from the Establecimiento Penitenciario y Carcelario de Mediana Seguridad de Manizales, Colombia. The sample was determined by applying Zung self-administered surveys for depression (1965) and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), the latter being the t**ool** used for the comparison. Results Initial Hamilton score, arrival time, duration of system downtime, and clinical effectiveness variables had normal distributions (P>.05). There were significant differences (P<.001) betwe**en c**are costs for the different models, showing th**at t**he mean cost**** of the** a**synchronous mod**el is le**ss than synchronous model, **and** ma**king t**he asynchro**nous** model more cost-effectiv**e. **Con**clusio**ns The asynchronou**s mo**del is the most cost-effective model of telepsychiatry care for patients with depression admitted to a detention centre, according to the results of **clin**ical effectiveness, cost measurement, and patient satisfaction.  2016 Asociacin Colombiana de Psiquiatra eid: 2-s2.0-84973590686

0. **Guided Internet-Based Self-Help Intervention for Social Anxiety Disorder With Videoconferenced Therapist Support**
We describe the development of a novel, Internet-based, self-help intervention for social anxiety disorder (**SAD**) in adults, and report data on the preliminary efficacy of the program when administered with minimal therapist support delivered via a common videoconferencing platform. Participants (n=13) completed the intervention, which consists of 8 weekly modules and a brief weekly videoconferenced check-in with a therapist. The intervention program is derived from an acceptance-based CBT program that utilizes traditional **behavior**al interventions (e.g., exposure) within the context of a model emphasizing mindful awareness and psychological acceptance of distressing subjective experiences. Assessments revealed that participants experienced a significant reduction** in** SAD symptoms and improvements in psychosocial functioning, and that treatment gains were maintained over a 3-month follow-up period. The effect sizes for the main outcome measures were large to very large (d=0.90 to 1.47), and **compar**able to other Internet-based treatment programs as well as in-person tri**als** for SAD (e.g., Feske & Chambless, 1995; Tulbure, 2011). Participants also rated the treatment program as highly acceptable. This pilot study provides preliminary evidence that an Internet-based intervention grounded in ba**sic beha**vioral and acceptance-based principles is effective for the t**rea**tment of SAD, and that videoconferenced therapist support may be useful in enhancing treatment compliance. Implications and **futur**e directions are **discuss**ed.  2016 eid: 2-s2.0-84944097655

0. **Predicting engagement with an online psychosocial intervention for psychosis: Exploring individual- and intervention-level predictors**
Background: Individuals with **psychosi**s demonstrate positive attitudes towards utilising digital technology in mental health treatment. Although preliminary research suggests digital interventions are feasible and acceptable in this **popul**ation, little is known about how to best promote engagement with these resources. Candidate predictors include therapist support, sources of motivation and recovery style. Understanding what factors predict engagement will aid more effective **design** and implementation of digital interventions to improve clinical benefits. Objective: This study aimed to investigate demographic, psychological, and treatment variables that predict overall and type of engagement with a psychosocial, online intervention for individuals w**ith psyc**hosis. Methods: Ninety-eight participants with a his**tory of **psychosis were given access to a **web** program containing modules on self-management and recovery, which they were asked to **use** flexibly at their own pace. Activity was automatically logged by the **system**. Baseline measures of demographics, recovery style and motivation were administered, and participants were randomised to receive eit**her** website access al**one**, or website access plus weekly, asynchronous emails from an online coach over 12 weeks. Log and baseline assessment data w**ere** used in negative binomial regressions to examine predictors of depth and bre**adt**h of use over the intervention period. A logistic reg**res**sion was used to examine the impact of predictor variables on usage profiles (active or passive). Results: Depth and breadth of engagement were positively predicted by receiving email support, low levels of externally controlled motivati****o**ns** for website use, older age, and having a tertiary education. There was a significant interaction between level of controlled motivation and condition (+/email) on breadth and depth of engagement: receiving asynchronous emails was associated with increased engagement for individuals with low, but not high, levels of externally controlled motivations. Receiving email support and more autonomous motivations for treatment pr**edi**cted more ac**tiv**e use of the website. Conclusions: Asynchronous email support can promote engagement with online interventions for indiv**iduals w**ith psychosis, potentially enabling self-management of illness and improving clinical outcomes. However, those using online interventions due to external motivating factors, may have low levels of engagement with the intervention, irrespective of coaching provided. These findings may gu**ide de**sign and implementation of future online interventions in t**his p**opulation.  2019 The Authors eid: 2-s2.0-85070855127

0. **Self-management intervention for head and neck cancer couples: Results of a randomized pilot trial**
Background: Patients with head and neck **cancer** (HNC) experience significant physical and psychological morbidity during radiotherapy (RT) that contributes to treatment interruptions and a poor **qualit**y of life. Although spouses/partners can help by encouraging patient self-management (eg, self-care) during RT, they often experience high psychological distress rates, lack basic health care knowledge and skills, and report increased marital conflict regarding patient self-management. The current pilot study examined the feasibility and acceptability of a 6-session **telephon**e-based intervention called Spouses coping with the Head And neck Radiation Experience (SHARE), which teaches self-management, communication, and coping skills to patients with HNC and their spouses. The treatment effects of SHARE compared with usual medical care (UMC) in controlling patient physical symptoms and improving patient/spouse psychological and marital functioning also were examined. Methods: Thirty patients who initiated RT and their spouses (60 participants; 40% of whom were racial/ethnic minorities) were randomized to SHARE or UMC, and preintervention and postintervention assessments were completed. Results: Solid recruitment (70%) and low attrition rates (7%) demonstrated feasibility. Strong program evaluations and homework completion rates (72%) **support**ed acceptability. Significant treatment effects (medium in magnitude) were observed for SHARE compared with UMC with regard to HNC-specific physical symptom burden (Cohens d, -0.89) and symptom interference (Cohens d, -0.86). Medium to large effects favoring SHARE also were found for patient and spouse depressive symptoms (Cohens d, -0.84) **and ca**ncer-specific distress (Cohens d, -1.05). Conclusions: The findings of the current st**udy sup**port the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of SHARE. They also suggest that programs that empower HNC couples with the necessary skills to coordinate care and manage the challenges of RT together hold great promise for controlling a patients physical symptoms and improving the psychological functioning of both partners.  2018 A**merica**n Cancer Society eid: 2-s2.0-85058017264

5. **Applying mobile technologies to mental health service delivery in South Asia**
Background: Patients with head and neck **cancer** (HNC) experience significant physical and psychological morbidity during radiotherapy (RT) that contributes to treatment interruptions and a poor **qualit**y of life. Although spouses/partners can help by encouraging patient self-management (eg, self-care) during RT, they often experience high psychological distress rates, lack basic health care knowledge and skills, and report increased marital conflict regarding patient self-management. The current pilot study examined the feasibility and acceptability of a 6-session **telephon**e-based intervention called Spouses coping with the Head And neck Radiation Experience (SHARE), which teaches self-management, communication, and coping skills to patients with HNC and their spouses. The treatment effects of SHARE compared with usual medical care (UMC) in controlling patient physical symptoms and improving patient/spouse psychological and marital functioning also were examined. Methods: Thirty patients who initiated RT and their spouses (60 participants; 40% of whom were racial/ethnic minorities) were randomized to SHARE or UMC, and preintervention and postintervention assessments were completed. Results: Solid recruitment (70%) and low attrition rates (7%) demonstrated feasibility. Strong program evaluations and homework completion rates (72%) **support**ed acceptability. Significant treatment effects (medium in magnitude) were observed for SHARE compared with UMC with regard to HNC-specific physical symptom burden (Cohens d, -0.89) and symptom interference (Cohens d, -0.86). Medium to large effects favoring SHARE also were found for patient and spouse depressive symptoms (Cohens d, -0.84) **and ca**ncer-specific distress (Cohens d, -1.05). Conclusions: The findings of the current st**udy sup**port the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of SHARE.

0. **Predictors of 12-month outcome in smokers who received bupropion sustained-release for smoking cessation**
**Aim**: To examine heterogeneity in outcome at 12 months following 8 weeks of treatment for smoking cessation with bupropion sustained-release (SR) 150 or 300 mg/day combined with behavioural counselling. Design, setting, participants: Smokers were recruited from a large healthcare system and then randomized to receive either bupropion SR 150 mg/day (n = 763) or 300 mg/day (n = 761) taken for 8 weeks in combination with either proactive **telephon**e counselling or a tailored mail approach. Measurements and findings: A comprehensive set of relevant individual pretreatment and treatment characteristics was included in the analysis. Smoking outcome at 12 months was defined as point-prevalence of any regular self-reported smoking within the 7 days prior to follow-up contact. Classification and regression tree analysis identified subgroups that varied with respect to likelihood of being nonsmokers at 12 months. Seven subgroups were identified among those receiving bupropion SR 150 mg/day (proportion of nonsmokers at 12 months ranged from 13.7% to 43.5%) and eight subgroups among those receiving bupropion SR 300 mg/day (proportion of nonsmokers at 12 months ranged from 9.6% to 51.7%). In the 150-mg/day group, those with the lowest rate reported no previous quit attempt of 1 month or more in duration while those with the **high**est rate all reported previous quit attempts of 1 month or longer. In the 300 mg/day group, those with the lowest rate had v**ery **high levels of dependence while those w**ith **the highest rat**e we**re more highly educated and smoked at a lower level. Across all subgroups, cost per 12-month quitter ranged from a low** of **$US302 to a high of $US2502. Conclusions: These results indicate the presence of a **substanti**al amount of variation in outcome following treatment with both dosages of bupropion SR, w**ith subst**antial cost consequences. Variation in outcome could be reduced by providing treatments tailored to subgroups of individuals who a**re a**t exceptionally high risk for smoking following a quit attempt.  2008 Adis Data Information BV.

0. **A model for digital mental healthcare: Its usefulness and potential for service delivery in low- and middle-income countries**
Background: Using **digit**al technology to deliver mental health care can possibly serve as a viable adjunct or alternative to mainstream services in lessening the mental health gap in a large number of resource deficient and LAMI countries. Conventional models of telepsychiatric services available so far, however, have been inadequate and ineffective, as these address only a small component of care, and rely on engagement of specialists who are grossly insufficient in numbers. Aim: To **describ**e an innovat**ive d**igital model of mental health care, enabling and empowering the non-specialists to deliver **high** quality mental health care in **remot**e areas. Methods: The model is powered by an online, fully automated clinical decision **support** system (CDSS), with interlinked modules for diagnosis, management and follow-up, usable by non-specialists after brief training and minimal supervision by psychiatrist, to deliver mental health care** at r**emote sites. Results: The CDSS has been found to** be **highly reliable, feasible, with sufficient sensitivity and specificity. This pa**per des**cribes the model and initial experience w**ith t**he digital mental health care system deployed in three geographically diffic**ult a**nd remote areas in northern hill states in India. The online system was found to be reasonably comprehensive, brief, feasible, **use**r-friendl**y, w**ith high levels of patient satisfaction. 2594 patients assessed a**t the** three remote sites and the nodal center represented varied diagnoses.

Background: Most of the early psychosis intervention (EPI) training has foc**use**d on family physicians participants. In Northern Ontario, there is a shortage of primary care. This paper w**ill** present **evalu**ation results of a pilot training programme for rural and remote youth **mental** health service providers. Method: A mixed methods **approach** **was** used.** We e**valuated a 2-day workshop about EPI for non-medi**cal me**ntal health workers delivered onsite and simultaneously by videoconferencing. There were 19 participants across four agencies. Seven were onsite and 12 were offsite. Participants' knowledge was measured using a validated questionnaire at pre-intervention and at 3-, 6- and 9-month follow up. A repeated measures ANOV**A w**as **used **to evaluate knowledge acquisition between the two modes of training. At 6 months, focus group interviews were conducted to explore their experiences of the mode of intervention d**elive**ry and evaluation. Emerging themes were iteratively derived through a series of discussions involving independent coders. Results: Only 15 complete datasets were available of the 19 original participants. Differences in knowledge acquisition between the two groups did not reach statistical difference. Six-month focus group data indicated that participants improved their relationship with EPI services and they were part of a strengthened network with other providers in the region. Post-intervention, the accuracy of referrals from participating agencies increased dramatically, with an increase in proportion of referrals who were eligible for EPI services. The follow-up process engaged participants in learning and re-engaged them with the material taught during the training session. Conclusions: The results about developing service partnerships and relationship with specialist services are encouraging for policy and service decision-makers to **addres**s **mental health servic**e needs in northern and remote areas.  2013 Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd. eid: 2-s2.0-84886747839

This paper w**ill** present **evalu**ation results of a pilot training programme for rural and remote youth **mental** health service providers. Method: A mixed methods **approach** **was** used.** We e**valuated a 2-day workshop about EPI for non-medi**cal me**ntal health workers delivered onsite and simultaneously by videoconferencing. There were 19 participants across four agencies. Seven were onsite and 12 were offsite. Participants' knowledge was measured using a validated questionnaire at pre-intervention and at 3-, 6- and 9-month follow up. A repeated measures ANOV**A w**as **used **to evaluate knowledge acquisition between the two modes of training. At 6 months, focus group interviews were conducted to explore their experiences of the mode of intervention d**elive**ry and evaluation. Emerging themes were iteratively derived through a series of discussions involving independent coders. Results: Only 15 complete datasets were available of the 19 original participants. Differences in knowledge acquisition between the two groups did not reach statistical difference. Six-month focus group data indicated that participants improved their relationship with EPI services and they were part of a strengthened network with other providers in the region. Post-intervention, the accuracy of referrals from participating agencies increased dramatically, with an increase in proportion of referrals who were eligible for EPI services. The follow-up process engaged participants in learning and re-engaged them with the material taught during the training session.

Asian Americans often face **cultur**al and language barriers when obtaining mental health treatment. With the small number of Asian mental health providers, it is difficult to ensure the linguistic and ethnic matching of providers and patients. Telepsychiatry holds great promise to address the unique needs of Asian Americans. We developed a project to establish telepsychiatry services that connect **Korean** mental health patients in Georgia with a linguistically **and cu**lturally **compet**ent psychiatrist in California and assessed the **level** of acceptability of psychiatric treatment via real-time teleconferencing among these patients. Upon the completion of the program, 16 patients (5 men, 11 women) completed a questionnaire that measured their acceptability of the telepsychiatry service. The findings indicate a h**igh l**evel of acceptance of the program am**ong Ko**rean patients. The quantitative and qualitative data show that they especially apprecia**ted th**e cultural sensitivity of the consultation and the **comfort**able interaction with the provider. However, challenges such as technical issues of teleconferencing may negatively affect the quality of the clinical interaction. Our study expands the knowledge base regarding the acceptability of such services to a **popul**ation that experiences disparities in mental health care. Future research should extend telepsychiatry services to other As**ian p**opulation groups that experience lower access to mental health services.  2012, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-84871264338

Background Telepsychiatry is becoming more commonplace in the provision of psychiatric care. Most commonly used in the outpatient setting, there is little information available in the literature as to the use of telepsychiatry for **inpati**ent medical/surgical consultation. Objective We review the University of Pittsburgh Medical **Center**'s telepsychiatry consultation program that provides consultation to an outlying community-based **rural** hospital. Methods This article examines the 69 telepsychiatry consultations that were performed from November 2014 through February 2016, looking at the patients served, common consultation questions, and patterns of diagnoses and recommendations. Results The median age of individuals undergoing telepsychiatry evaluations was 67 years, and the most common reason for consultation was for delirium. Over half of the patients consulted had a primary diagnosis of delirium, dementia, or a cognitive disorder not otherwise specified, using Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition, Text Revision) diagnoses. In most patients, additional laboratory studies or imaging or both were requested and medication changes recommended (initiation, dose changes, and discontinuation). Conclusion This report provides one of the first detailed views of the use of telepsychiatry in a rem**ote in**patient medical setting. Findings will guide education to primary teams and will shape the **develop**ment of future telepsychiatry interventions.  2018 The Academy of Psychosomatic Medicine. eid: 2-s2.0-85029228744

Background: **Evalu**ation of telepsychiatry (via videoconference) for older adults is mostly focussed on nursing homes or inpatients.** We e**valuated the role of a community based program for older adults in **rural** and **remot**e regions of South Australia. Method: The utilization pattern was studied using retrospective chart review of telepsychiatry assessments over 24 months (2010-2011). **Satisfact****ion w**as evaluated through prospective post-consultation feedback (using a 5-point Likert scale), from patients, community based clinicians and psychiatrist participating in consecutive assessments from April-November 2012. Descriptive analysis was **use**d for the utilization. Mean scores and proportions were calculated for the feedback. Mann Whitney U test **was** used to compare patient subgroups based on age, gender, prior exposure to telepsychiatry services and inpatient/ outpatient status. Feedback comments were analysed for emerging themes. Results: On retrospective review of 134 consults, mean age was 75.89 years (SD 7.55), 60.4% (81) were females, and 71.6% (96) lived independently. Patients had a broad range of psychiatric disorders, from **mood** disorders to delirium and dementia, with co-morbid medical illness in 83.5% (112). **On fe**edback evaluation (N = 98), mean scores ranged from 3.88-4.41 for patients, 4.36-4.73 for clinicians and 3.67-4.45 for psychiatrists. Feedback from inpatients (14 out of 37) was significantly lower compared to outpatients (37 out of 61) (chi sq. = 0.808, p < 0.05), and they were significantly less satisfied with the wait time (U = 163.0, p < 0.05) and visual clarity (U = 160.5, p < 0.05).

Patients had a broad range of psychiatric disorders, from **mood** disorders to delirium and dementia, with co-morbid medical illness in 83.5% (112). **On fe**edback evaluation (N = 98), mean scores ranged from 3.88-4.41 for patients, 4.36-4.73 for clinicians and 3.67-4.45 for psychiatrists. Feedback from inpatients (14 out of 37) was significantly lower compared to outpatients (37 out of 61) (chi sq. = 0.808, p < 0.05), and they were significantly less satisfied with the wait time (U = 163.0, p < 0.05) and visual clarity (U = 160.5, p < 0.05). Audio clarity was the most common aspect of** dissatis**faction (mean score less than 3) among patients (6, 11%). Psychiatrists reported a preference for telepsychiatry over **face to fac**e in 55.4% (46) assessments. However, they expressed discomfort in situations of cognitive or sensory disabilities in patients. Conclusions:** In r**ural **and r**emote areas, community-based telepsychiatry program c**an **be a useful adjunct for psychiatrist input in the care of older adults. Innovations to overcome sensory deficits and collaboration with community services should be explored to improve its acceptance among the most vulnerable population.  2018 The Author(s). eid: 2-s2.0-38949111763

0. **An economic cost analysis of an expanding, multi-state behavioural telehealth intervention**
**Introduct**ion: In this paper the **econom**ic **cost**s associated with a growing, multi-state telepsychiatry intervention serving rural American Indian/Alaska Native populations were compared** to **costs of **travel**ling to provide/receive in-person treatment. Methods: Telepsy**chia**try costs were calculated using administrative, information-technology, equipment and technology components, and were compare**d t**o** tr**avel cost models. Both a **patien**t travel and a p**sychia**trist travel model were estimated utilising ArcGIS so**ftwa**re and unit costs gathered from **literatur**e and **gove**rnment sources. Cost structure and sensitivity **analysi**s was also calculated by varying modeling parameters and assumptions. Results and Discussion: It is est**imat**ed that per-session costs were $93.90, $183.34, and $268.23 for telemed**icine,** provider-**travel**, and patient-travel, respectively. Restricting **the ana**lysis to satellite locations with a larger number of visits reduced telemed**icin**e per-patient encounter costs (50 or more visits: $83.52; 100 or more visits: $80.41; and 150 or more** vis**its: $76.25). The estimated cost efficiencies of telemedicine were more evident for highly rural communities. Finally, we found that a multi-state centre was cheaper than each state operating independently. Conclusions: Consistent with previous research, this study provides additional evidence of **the ec**onomic efficiency associated with telemedicine interventions for rural American Indian/Alaska Native populations. Our results suggest that th**ere ar**e economies of scale in providing **behaviour**al telemedicine and that bigger, multi-state tele**medi**cine centres have lower overall costs compared to smaller, state-level centres. Additionally, results suggest that telemedicine structures with a higher number of per-**sate**llite patient encounters have lower costs, and telemedicine centres delivering care to highly rural populations prod**uce gr**eater economic benefits.

0. **AiRCare: A Naturalistic Evaluation of the Effectiveness of a Protracted Telephone-Based Recovery Assistance Program on Continuing Care Outcomes**
Background & Objective **Substanc**e **use** disorder treatments are increasingly being contextualized within a disease management framework. Within this context, there is an identified need to maintain patients in treatment for longer periods of time in order to help them learn how to manage their disease. One way to meet this need is through telephone-based interventions that engage patients, and include more active outreach attempts and involvement of the patient's family. This study sought to evaluate the effectiveness of three formats of an intensive 12-month post-discharge telephone-based case management approach (AiRCare) on adherence to continuing care plans **and subs**ta**nce** use outcomes. Methods Data were abstracted from electronic medical records for 379 patients (59.9% male) discharged from a residential treatment program located in the southwestern U.S. from 2013 to 2015. Patients were categorized into one of three groups and received telephone contacts based on their self-selection upon admission to residential treatment (i.e., patient only, family only, and both patient and family). Outcome variables included re-engagement and re-admission rates, quality of life, **abstin**ence rates at 6 and 12 months, and compliance with continuing care plans. Results & Conclusions Favorable short- and long-term outcomes were found for the majority of patients, irrespective of case management group. There appeared to be some value in the addition of family contacts to patient contacts with respect to reducing risk for 12-month re-admission to residential care. These positive but preliminary indications of the effectiveness of AiRCare require replication in a well-powered, randomized controlled trial.  2016 Elsevier Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-84993969530

Stakeholders reported that local RNs (and possibly FNPs) were employed by the local hospital and that a subgroup may have aptitude and interest in psychiatry if a **univers**ity program and preceptors were available. Collaborating with an urban PMHNP program, televideo technology for clinical training and preceptor **develop**ment offers a solution to the dearth of preceptors. A pilot intervention will use teleprecepting aimed at establishing best practice guidelines for implementation of this novel approach to expanding the clinical training and capa**city **in rural and under-served communities.  2019,  2**019 Uni**versity of California San Francisco. eid: 2-s2.0-39149100645

0. **Practical issues in delivery of clinician-to-patient telemental health in an academic medical center**
Background: In the age of online communication, psychiatric care can now be provided via videoconferencing technologies. While virtual visits as a part of telepsychiatry and telemental health provide a highly efficient and beneficial modality of care, the implementation of virtual visits requires attention to quality and safety issues. As practitioners continue to utilize this technology, issues of clinician licensing, treatment outcomes of virtual visits versus in-person visits, and **cost** offset require ongoing study. Methods: This review provides an overview of the topics of technology, legal and regulatory issues, clinical issues, **and **cost savings as they relate to practicing psychiatry and psychology via virtual visits in an **academ**ic medical center. We review the telepsychiatry/telemental health effectiveness **literatur**e from 2013 to the present. **Our liter**ature searches **use**d the following terms: telemental health effective, telepsychiatry effective, telepsychiatry efficacy, and telemental health efficacy. These searches produced 58 articles, reduced to 16 when including only articles that address effectiveness of clinician-to-patient services. Results: The technological, legal, and regulatory issues vary from state to state and over time. The emerging research addressing diverse populations and disorders provides strong evidence for the effectiveness of telepsyc**hiat**ry. Cost savings are difficult to precisely determine and depend on the s**cope** of the cost and **benefit** measured. Conclusion: Establishing a telepsychiatry program requires a comprehensive approach with up-to-date legal and technological considerations.  2017 President and Fellows of Harvard College. eid: 2-s2.0-85020433122

Methods: We conducted a survey entailing 486 subjects (297 MHP and 189 patients). Results: Professionals and patients indicate both, considerable acceptance and rejection for most features. Marked concerns across groups relate to data security** in g**eneral. Actimetry and geotracking were considered particularly skeptical. Importantly, most patients prefer to be prompted timely about health status changes. Conclusion: Altogether, evidence indicates substantial **support** for mHealth features in mental healthcare despite considerable rejec**tion of **distinct features. We conclude that tighter collaboration between researchers, developers and clinicians must a**ddress **matching mHealth-apps to patients' needs.

0. **Enchantment in psychiatric medicine**
Max Weber's 1918 essay Science as a Vocation posits that increasing scientific knowledge has contributed to a disenchantment of the natural world. His argument has implications for medicine, an applied science aimed at the improvement of health, including psychiatric medicine. Using Weber's argument, this **paper** discusses the ambivalent relationship psychiatry has with technology. On one hand, based on the historical roots of the specialty and the influence of psychodynamic psychotherapy, psychiatrists believe themselves to be masters of the invisible space between physicians and their patients. They claim to have the skills and insight that enable them to establish a unique kind of relationship in which communication not only allows them to diagnose, but also to heal through a variety of psychotherapeutic techniques. As a result, many psychiatrists are wary of the introduction of technology into therapeutic setting and the potential for this type of communication to be disrupted or diminished in value, often basing their concern on the ways in which technology has been witnessed to be disenchanting in other medical specialties. On the other hand, others see the future practice of psychiatry best guided through whole-hearted embrace of brain-based medical technology, which has been stunted by the complexity of the brain and relative lack of research **fund**ing compared to other medical specialties. This discussion within the field is timely, as on the horizon lies the holy grail of technological advancement for psychiatric practice: definitive biomarkers to diagnose mental illness and provide individualized treatments.  2019 Elsevier B.V. eid: 2-s2.0-85073722642

0. **Capacity, consent and electroconvulsive therapy: A qualitative and cross-sectional study**
Background: Mental capacity based mental health legislation has been proposed, but its potential impact on practice has not been described. Aims: To describe the extent to which mental capacity based law might change prescriptions of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in England and Wales. Method: A qualitative study using focus groups and semi-structured interviews of psychiatrists, was followed by a cross sectional study of 186 consultant psychiatrists. Results: Psychiatrists were divided in their management of detained but apparently competent patients refusing ECT. From the cross sectional survey, 15.9% reported having prescribed ECT in such patients, but some expressed views that the treatment was not acceptable under these circumstances. Conclusions: Mental capacity based legislation could limit the use of compulsory treatment to some individuals refusing treatment. However, it might equally lead to psychiatrists redefining their operational definitions of mental capacity. Declaration of **interest**: This study was funded by the Department of Health.

0. **A Promising New Strategy to Improve Treatment Outcomes for Patients with Depression**
Each year, ineffective medical management of patients with mental illness compromises the health and well-being of individuals, and also impacts communities and our society. A variety of interrelated factors have impeded the health system's ability to treat patients with behavior health conditions adequately. A key contributing factor is a lack of objective markers to help predict patient response to specific drugs that has led to patterns of "trial and error" prescribing. For many years, clinicians have sought objective data (eg, a laboratory or imaging test) to assist them in selecting appropriate treatments for individual patients. Electroencephalogram (EEG) findings coupled with medication outcomes data may provide a solution. "Crowdsourced" physician registries that reference clinical outcomes to individual patient physiology have been **use**d successfully for cancers. These techniques are now being explored in the context of behavioral health care. The Psychiatric EEG **Evalu**ation Registry (PEER) is one such approach. PEER is a clinical phenotypic database comprising more than 11,000 baseline EEGs and more than 39,000 outcomes of medication treatment for a variety of mental health diagnoses. Collective findings from 45 studies (3130 patients) provide compelling evidence for PEER as a relatively simple, inexpensive predictor of likely patient response to specific anti**depress**ants and likely treatment-related side effects (including suicidal ideation).

"Crowdsourced" physician registries that reference clinical outcomes to individual patient physiology have been **use**d successfully for cancers. These techniques are now being explored in the context of behavioral health care. The Psychiatric EEG **Evalu**ation Registry (PEER) is one such approach. PEER is a clinical phenotypic database comprising more than 11,000 baseline EEGs and more than 39,000 outcomes of medication treatment for a variety of mental health diagnoses. Collective findings from 45 studies (3130 patients) provide compelling evidence for PEER as a relatively simple, inexpensive predictor of likely patient response to specific anti**depress**ants and likely treatment-related side effects (including suicidal ideation).

Each year, ineffective medical management of patients with mental illness compromises the health and well-being of individuals, and also impacts communities and our society. A variety of interrelated factors have impeded the health system's ability to treat patients with behavior health conditions adequately. A key contributing factor is a lack of objective markers to help predict patient response to specific drugs that has led to patterns of "trial and error" prescribing.
