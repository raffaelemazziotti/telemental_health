0. **Remote consultations in the era of COVID-19 pandemic: Preliminary experience in a regional Australian public acute mental health care setting**
In the wake of the recent **pandem**ic of Corona Virus **Diseas**e 2019 (COVID-19), with confirmed cases having crossed 750,000, health systems across the **world** are getting overwhelmed; making it strenuous to maintain essential health services. Several changes were implemented in our acute **mental health car**e service using a collaborative approach to maintain a balance between preventive measures to flatten the curve and to provide care to those who were in need. Mode of service delivery was changed predominantly to tele-medicine, amongst others. It was found to be a workable model, albeit further follow up will be required to better understand its viability and feasibility to withstand the COVID-19 cataclysm.  2020 eid: 2-s2.0-85083013026
1. **COVID-19 and mental health: A review of the existing literature**
The COVID-19 **pandem**ic is a major health crisis affecting several nations, with over 720,000 cases and 33,000 confirmed deaths reported to date. Such widespread outbreaks are associated with adverse mental health consequences. Keeping this in mind, existing literature on the COVID-19 outbreak pertinent to mental health was retrieved via a literature search of the PubMed database. Published articles were classified according to their overall themes and summarized. Preliminary evidence suggests that symptoms of anxiety and **depress**ion (1628%) and self-reported stress (8%) are common psychological reactions to the COVID**-19 pa**ndemic, and may be associated with disturbed sleep. A number of individual and structural variables moderate this risk. In planning services for such populations, both the needs of the concerned people and the necessary preventive guidelines must be taken into account. The available literature has emerged from only a few of the affected countries, and may not reflect the experience of persons living in other parts of the **world**. In conclusion, subsyndromal mental health problems are a common response to the C**OVID-1**9 pandemic. There is a need for more representative research from other affected countries, particularly in vulnerable populations.  2020 Elsevier B.V. eid: 2-s2.0-85083048100
2. **Psychological interventions during COVID-19: Challenges for low and middle income countries**
At the start of 2020, the 2019 coronavirus **diseas**e (COVID-19), originating from China has spread to the **world**. There have been increasing numbers of confirmed cases and deaths around the globe. The COVID-19 **pandem**ic has paved the way for considerable psychological and psychosocial morbidity among the general public and health care providers. An array of guidelines has been put forward by multiple agencies for combating mental health challenges. This paper addresses some of the mental health challenges faced by low and middle income countries (LMIC). It is worthwhile to note that these are challenges at the current stage of **the pa**ndemic and may change with the course** of th**e pandemic itself.  2020 Elsevier B.V. eid: 2-s2.0-85084129392
3. **Ultra brief psychological interventions for covid-19 pandemic: Introduction of a locally-adapted brief intervention for mental health and psychosocial support service**
The ultra-brief psychological interventions (UBPI) was created in 2018 to empower healthcare providers with psychological skills that can be delivered within a short period. Techniques used within UBPI were adopted from a variety of well established psychotherapies and distilled into its core essentials. This enabled practitioners of UBPI to deliver specific psychological skills in the appropriate context to the client within a period of 1520 min. UBPI was also manualised to standardised training of practitioners. During the novel coronavirus **diseas**e of 2019 (COVID-19) **pandem**ic, UBPI was modified to suit the unique psychological demands of **the pa**ndemic. This article presents how UBPI was adapted and used with healthcare providers dealing with COVID-19 and also with the public who required psychological first aid (PFA).

0. **Emergency Department Telepsychiatry Service Model for a Rural Regional Health System: The First Steps**
Background: **Emerg**ency **depart**ments (EDs) have recognized an increasing number of patients presenting with mental health (MH) concerns. This trend imposes greater demands upon EDs already operating at capacity. Many ED providers do not feel they are optimally prepared to provide the necessary MH care. One consideration in response to this dilemma is to use advanced telemedicine technology for psychiatric consultation. Introduction: We examined a **rural**-and community-based health system operating 21 EDs, none of which has direct access to psychiatric consultation. Dedicated beds to MH range from zero (in EDs with only 3 beds) to 6 (in an ED with 38 beds). Materials and Methods: We conducted a needs assessment of this health system. This included a survey** of e**mergency room providers with a 67% response rate and site visits to directly observe patient flow and communication with ED staff. A visioning workshop provided input from ED staff. Data were also obtained, which reflected ED admissions for the year 2015. Results: The data provide a summary of provider concerns, a summary of MH presentations and diagnosis, and age groupings. The data also provide a time when most MH concerns present to the ED. Discussion: Based upon these results, a proposed model for delivering comprehensive r**egion**al emergency telepsychiatry and behavioral health services is proposed. C**onclu**sions: Emergency telepsychiatry services may be a tenable solution for addressing the shortage of psychiatric consultation to EDs in light of increasing demand for MH treatment in the ED.  2019, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-85059896853
1. **Evaluation and Implementation of a Telepsychiatry Trial in the Emergency Department of a Metropolitan Public Hospital**
Telepsychiatry via video conferencing is not new to mental health but has been expanding at a rapid rate over recent years. Initially it was introduced for treatment in **remot**e and **rural** communities, but it is now being utilized in larger health settings due to increasing patient demand and cost-effectiveness. **Emerg**ency **depart**ments are becoming increasingly burdened, as the workforce cannot keep pace with the rising demand of patient mental health needs. While telepsychiatry has been shown to have treatment efficacy, research is still relatively new, especially within **the e**merge**ncy de**partment context.  2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. eid: 2-s2.0-85029905979
2. **The symbolic affordances of a video-mediated gaze in emergency psychiatry**
While mental illness is a significant health challenge worldwide, the availability of specialists is limited, especially in **rural** areas and for psychiatric **emerg**encies. Although tele-psychiatry, via real-time videoconferencing (VC), is used to provide consultative services in areas that lack psychiatrists, there are a paucity of studies on the use of VC for psychiat**ric e**mergencies. We examine how VC matters for patient involvement and professional practice in the first No**rwegi**an emergency tele-psychiatric service. Through a decentralised on-call system, psychiatrists are accessible 24/7 by telephone and VC for patients and nurses in regional psychiatry centres. Based on 29 interviews with patients, psychiatrists and nurses, this article addresses how participation is fostered by VC, and how it may change the social dynamics of **thera**peutic emergency encounters. We identified four contributions of the video-mediated gaze in the therapeutic encounter including those of the: (1) immediacy of assessment, (2) increased transparency, (3) sense of access to the real expert, and (4) fostering of the patient's voice in therapeutic decisions. These VC inflections of the therapeutic encounter are a mix of the pragmatic (1 and 2) and the symbolic (3 and 4), assembling in these contexts to foster patient-centeredness. With a sociological approach to vi**deo-c**onferenced emergency psychiatry, the identification of symbolic affordances adds necessary nuances to the application of new technologies into fragile therapeutic communication.  2017 Elsevier Ltd eid: 2-s2.0-85037345227
3. **Telephone-based low intensity therapy after crisis presentations to the emergency department is associated with improved outcomes**
Introduction In Australia there is an overwhelming need to provide effective treatment to patients presenting to the **Emerg**ency **Depart**ment (ED) in mental health crisis. We adapted Improving Access to Psychological Therapies service model (IAPT) from the National Health Service (NHS) method for the large scale delivery of psychological therapies throughout the United Kingdom to an Australian ED setting. This telephone-based low intensity therapy was provided to people presenting in crisis to the EDs with combinations of anxiety, depression, substance use, and suicidal thinking. Methods This uncontrolled study utilised session-by-session, before-and-after measures of anxiety and depression via Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7). Results Of 347 eligible post-crisis ED referred patients, 291 (83.9%) engaged with the IAPT team. Most patients (65%) had attended the ED previously on an average of 3.9 (SD = 6.0) occasions. Two hundred and forty one patients received an average of 4.1 (SD = 2.3) contacts of low-intensity psychological therapies including 1.2 (SD = 1.7) community outreach visits between 20th Oct 2011 and 31st Dec 2012. Treated patients reported clinically significant improvements in anxiety, depression and suicidal ideation. Uncontrolled effect sizes were moderate for anxiety (0.6) and depression (0.6). Discussion The Australian ED IAPT program demonstrated that the UK IAPT program could be adapted **for e**mergency mental health patients and be associated with similar clinical benefits as the original program. Funding The Flinders Medical Centre IAPT program r**eceiv**ed Emerge**ncy De**partment project funding from the Australian Commonwealth Government through the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) and the South Australian Government initiative, Every Patient Every Service (EPES).  2015,  The Author(s) 2015. eid: 2-s2.0-84942102573
4. **Child and Adolescent Emergency and Urgent Mental Health Delivery Through Telepsychiatry: 12-Month Prospective Study**
Background: The significant gap between children and **adolesc**ents presenting for **emerg**ency mental healthcare and the shortage of child **and ado**lescent psychiatrists constitutes a major barrier to timely access for psychiatric assessment for **rural** and **remot**e areas. Unl**ike r**emote areas, ur**ban e**mergency **depart**ments have in-house psychiatric consultation. Telepsychiatry may be a solution to ensure the same serv**ice f**or remote areas. However, there is a paucity of studies on the use of telepsychiatry for child and ado**lesce**nt emergency consults. Thus, the aim of our study was to (1) assess patient satisfaction with telepsychiatry and (2) compare clinical characteristics and outcome of telepsychiatry with f**ace-t**o-face emergency ch**ild and** adolescent assessments. Methods: This is a prospective study of** tele**psychiatry emergency assessments of children and adol**escen**ts referred by emergency physicians. The comparison group was age- and gender-matched patients seen for face-to-face urgent assessments. Data were gathered on demographic and clinical variables. Telepsychiatry satisfaction was assessed using a questionnaire. Descriptive statistics and chi-square tests were used to assess group differences for each variable. Logistic regression was used to assess impact of the variables on outcome after the consult. A p value <0.05 was used to determine statistical significance. Results: Sixty (n = 60) assessments were conducted through telepsychiatry in 12 months. Among the telepsychiatry group, Aboriginal patients were over-represented (50% vs. 6.7%, p < 0.001), a higher proportion received a diagnosis of adjustment disorder (22% vs. 8.3%, p = 0.004) or no diagnosis (27% vs. 6.7%, p = 0.004) compared with controls. There was no statistically significant difference between groups on other clinical variables. Patients reported a high degree of satisfaction with telepsychiatry. Conclusions: Telepsychiatry is acceptable to patient**s and** families for safe emergency assessment and follow-up, reducing unnecessary travel to urban centers. Longer time outcomes are needed to establish val**idity** of telepsychiatry for emergency assessments.  Copyright 2017, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2017. eid: 2-s2.0-85031290037
5. **Reduced Unplanned Care and Disease Activity and Increased Quality of Life After Patient Enrollment in an Inflammatory Bowel Disease Medical Home**
Background & Aims: Specialty medical homes (SMHs) are a new health care model in which a multidisciplinary team and specialists manage patients with chronic diseases. As part of a large integrated payerprovider network, we formed an inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) SMH and investigated its effects on health care use, disease activity, and quality of life (QoL). Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of 322 patients (58% female; mean age, 34.6 y; 62% with Crohn's disease; 32% with prior IBD surgery) enrolled in an IBD SMH, in conjunction with the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Health Plan, from June 2015 through July 2016. Patients had at least 1 year of follow up. We evaluated changes in numbers of **emerg**ency **depart**ment visits and hospitalizations from the year before vs after SMH enrollment. Secondary measures included IBD activity assessments and QoL. Results: Compared to the year before IBD SMH enrollment, patients had a 47.3% reduction** in e**merge**ncy de**partment visits (P <.0001) and a 35.9% reduction in hospitalizations (P =.008). In the year following IBD SMH enrollment, patients had significant reductions in the median HarveyBradshaw Index score (reduced from 4 to 3.5; P =.002), and median ulcerative colitis activity index score (from 4 to 3; P =.0003), and increases in QoL (median short inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire score increased from 50 to 51.8; P <.0001). Patients in the most extreme (highest and lowest) quartiles had the most improvement when we compared scores at baseline vs after enrollment. Based on multivariable regression analysis, use of corticosteroids (odds ratio [OR], 2.72; 95% CI, 1.325.66; P =.007) or opioids (OR, 3.20; 95% CI, 1.327.78; P =.01), and low QoL (OR, 4.44; 95% CI, 1.0818.250; P =.04) at enrollment were significantly associated with per**siste**nt em**ergenc**y department visits and hospitalizations. Conclusions: We found development of an IBD SMH to be feasible and significantly reduce unplanned care and disease activity and increase patient QoL 1 year after enrollment.  2018 AGA Institute eid: 2-s2.0-85050114456
6. **No longer 'flying blind': How access has changed emergency mental health care in rural and remote emergency departments, a qualitative study**
Background: Mental health presentations are considered to be a difficult aspect of **emerg**ency care. Altho**ugh e**mergency **depart**ment (ED) staff is qualified to **provi**de emergency mental health care, for some, such presentations pose a challenge to their training, confidence, and time. Providing access to relevant and responsive specialist mental health care can influence care and management for these patients. The Me**ntal **Health Emergency Care-**Rural** Access Program (MHEC-RAP) is a telepsychiatry program that was established to improve acces**s to **specialist emergency mental health care acr**oss r**ural and **remot**e western NSW, Australia. Method: This study uses interviews with ED providers to understand their exp**erien**ce of managing emergency mental health patients and their use of MHEC-RAP. The lens of access was applied to assess program impact and inform continuing program development. Results: With MHEC-RAP, these ED providers are no longer 'flying blind'. They are also more confident** to m**anage and care for emergency mental health patients locally. For these providers, access to specialists who are able to conduct assessments and provide relevan**t and** responsive advice for emergency mental health presentations was valued. Assessing the fit between the consumer and service as a requirement for the development, evaluation, and ongoing management of the service should result in decisions about design and delivery that achieve improved access to care and meet the needs of their consumers. The experience of these providers prior to MHEC-RAP is consistent with that reported i**n oth**er rural **and r**emote populations suggesting that MHEC-RAP could address limitations in access to specialist c**are a**nd change the provision of emergency mental health care elsewhere. Conclusion: MHEC-RAP has not only provided access to specialist mental health care for local ED providers, but it has changed their practice and perspective. MHEC-RAP could be adapted for implementation elsewhere. Provider experience confirms that the program is accessible and offers insights to th**ose c**onsidering how to establish an emergency telepyschiatry service in other settings.  2015 Saurman et al.; licensee BioMed Central. eid: 2-s2.0-84928798574
7. **Assessing program efficiency: A time and motion study of the mental health emergency care - Rural access program in NSW Australia**
The Mental Health **Emerg**ency Care-**Rural** Access Program (MHEC-RAP) is a telehealth solution providing special**ist e**mergency mental health care** to r**ural and **remot**e communities across western NSW, Australia. This is the first time and motion (T&M) study to examine program efficiency and capacity for a telepsychiatry program. Clinical services are an integral aspect of the program accounting for 6% of all activities and 50% of the time spent conducting program activities, but half of this time is spent completing clinical paperwork. This finding emphasizes the importance of these services to program efficiency and the need to address variability of service provision to impact capacity. Currently, there is no efficiency benchm**ark f**or emergency telepsychiatry programs. Findings suggest that MHEC-RAP could increase its activity without affecting program responsiveness. T&M studies not only determine activity and time expenditure, but have a wider application assessing program efficiency by understanding, defining, and calculating capacity. T&M studies can inform future program development of MHEC-RAP and similar telehealth programs, both in Australia and overseas.  2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland. eid: 2-s2.0-84905643979
8. **Telemental health evaluations enhance access and efficiency in a critical access hospital emergency department**
Introduction: Mentally ill patients in crisis presenting to critical access hospital **emerg**ency rooms often face exorbitant wait times to be evaluated by a trained mental health provider. Patients may be discharged from the hospital before receiving an evaluation or boarded in a hospital bed for observation, reducing quality and increasing costs. This study examined the effectiveness of** an e**mergency telemental health evaluation service implemented in a **rural** h**ospit**al emergency room. Materials and Methods: Retrospective data collection was implemented to consider patients presen**ting **to the emergency room for 212 days prior to telemedicine interventions and for 184 days after. The study compared measures of time to treatment, length of stay (regardless of inpatient or outpatient status), and door-to-consult time. Results: There were 24 patients seen before telemedicine was implemented and 38 seen using telemedicine. All patients had a mental health evaluation ordered by a physician and completed by a mental health specialist. Significant reductions in all three time measures were observed. Mean and median times to consult were reduced from 16.2 h (standard deviation=13.2 h) and 14.2 h, respectively, to 5.4 h (standard deviation=6.4 h) and 2.6 h. Similar reductions in length of stay and door-to-consult times were observed. By t tests, use of telemedicine was associated with a statistically significant reduction in all three outcome measures. Conclusions: Telemedicine appears to be an effective intervention for mentally ill patients by providing more timely access to mental health evaluations in** rura**l hospital emergency **depart**ments.  2014 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-84903607877
9. **Emergency management guidelines for telepsychiatry**
Objective: Telepsychiatry, in the form of live interactive videoconferencing, is an **emerg**ing application **for e**mergency psychiatric assessment and treatment and can improve the quality and quantity of **mental health servic**es, particularly for **rural**, **remot**e and isolated populations. Despite the poten**tial **of emergency telepsychiatry, the literature has been fairly limited in this area. Method: Drawing on the combined clinical and administrative experiences of its authors, this article reviews the common administrative, legal/ethical and clinical issues th**at ar**ise in emergency telepsychiatry. Results: An initial set of** guid**elines for emergency telepsychiatry is presented to generate further discussion to assist those who are considering establishing general te**lepsy**chiatry and/or emergency telepsychiatry services. Conclusion: The prac**tices** and techniques of emergency telepsychiatry are relatively new and require further examination, modification and refinement so that they may be fully utilized within comprehens**ive mental health se**rvice systems.  2007 Elsevier Inc.

0. **Telepsychotherapy for trichotillomania: A randomized controlled trial of ACT enhanced behavior therapy**
Despite its prevalence, quality treatment for trichotillomania is often difficult to find. The use of telepsychology has been an effective method for disseminating treatment services for a variety of mental health conditions. However, no research has examined the use of telepsychology to treat trichotillomania. This randomized controlled trial used Acceptance and **Commit**ment Therapy Enhanced Behavior Therapy delivered by way of telepsychology to treat trichotillomania in adults. The study compared an **act**ive treatment condition (n = 12) to a delayed treatment waitlist control condition (n = 10). Results showed significant reductions in hair pulling severity from pre- to post-treatment compared to the waitlist condition. The 22 participants all received treatment and were combined to examine overall treatment effects from pre-treatment to a 12-week follow-up. The effect of treatment on hair pulling severity remained significant at follow-up. Measures of psychological flexibility and perceived shame also saw significant improvement. Quality of **life**, however, did not improve over the course of treatment. The findings demonstrate that telepsychology is a viable option to disseminate treatment for trichotillomania.  2018 Elsevier Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-85046370384
1. **Pilot evaluation of a web-based acceptance and commitment therapy program to promote mental health skills in university students**
Objective: This study evaluated a 4-week web-based acceptance and **commit**ment therapy (**ACT**) mental health promotion program called YOLO (You Only Live Once) for **univers**ity students. Method: A total of 130 participants were randomized to one of three intervention groups investigating varied program delivery methods. Primary outcomes assessed: depression, anxiety, stress, well-being, self-compassion, alcohol use, and **life** sa**tis**f**act**ion. ACT processes assessed: acceptance, cognitive fusion, education values, valued living, and mindfulness. Results: Improvement on the primary o**utc**omes and ACT processes did not differ among the three intervention groups. Analyses showed significant improvements on all primary outcomes (except alcohol u**se)**, and on all** AC**T processes. All ACT processes mediated changes on one or more primary outcomes in the intent-to-treat sample. Intervention effects were consistent on mo**st **primary outcomes and ACT processes across three sample groupings. Conclusions: These preliminary findings prov**ide** support for a web-based ACT mental health promotion program **for uni**versity students.  2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-85050502026
2. **Web-Based Self-Help for Preventing Mental Health Problems in Universities: Comparing Acceptance and Commitment Training to Mental Health Education**
Objective: This study sought to test the feasibility of a web-based Acceptance and **Commit**ment Training (**ACT**) prototype prevention program cal**led** ACT on Colleg**e L**ife (ACT-CL). Method: A sample of 234 **univers**ity students was randomized to** ei**ther the ACT-CL website or a mental health education (MHE) website. Results: Findings indicated a lower level of user engag**eme**nt and **satisfact**ion ratings wi**th **the prototype of ACT-CL than the MHE website. There were no significant differences between conditions on outcome measures at post or follow-up. However, statistical trends sugg**est**ed the MHE condition actually led to greater remission **of **severe symptoms than the ACT-CL condition among those with severe symptoms at baseline. There were no di**ffe**rences between conditions on ACT process of change measures. Changes in psychological flexibility were predictive of changes in mental health across conditions, but relations dissipated over time. Furthermore, great**er **engagement in some components of ACT-CL predicted improvements in psychological flexibility, though not on mental health ou**tco**mes. Conclusions: The effects of the A**CT-**CL program on mental health outcomes and ACT process measures were largely equivalent to those of an education website, although the**re **was a lower level of program engagement with ACT-CL. Findings are discussed in the context of feasibility issues and lessons learned for program revisions.  2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-84958680658
3. **Guided and unguided Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for social anxiety disorder and/or panic disorder provided via the Internet and a smartphone application: A randomized controlled trial**
Acceptance and **Commit**ment Therapy (**ACT**) can be effective in treating anxiety disorders, yet there has been no study on Internet-delive**red** ACT for social anxiety disorder (SAD) and panic disorder (PD), nor any study investigating whether therapist guidance is superior to unguided self-help when supplemented with a smartphone application. In the current trial, n = 152 participants diagnosed with SAD and/or PD were randomized to therapist-guided or unguided treatment, or a waiting-list control group. Both treatment groups used an Internet-de**liv**ered ACT-based treatment program and a smartphone application. Outcome measures were self-rated general and social anxiety and panic symptoms. Treatment groups saw reduced general (d = 0.39) and social anxiety (d = 0.70), but not panic symptoms (d = 0.05) compared to the waiting-list group, yet no differences in outcomes were observed between guided and unguided interventions. We conclude that Interne**t-d**elivered ACT is appropriate for treating SAD and potentially PD. Smartphone applications may partially compensate for lack of therapist support.  2016 eid: 2-s2.0-84991059235
4. **Rural Assertive Community Treatment and Telepsychiatry**
Assertive community treatment (**ACT**) is an evidence-based treatment for patients with severe and persistent mental illne**ss.** ACT has been shown to reduce inpatient hospitalization and is increasingly being used as a mainstay of evidence-based psychi**atr**ic practice for these clinical populations. The increasing implementation of evide**nce**-based practices has led to t**he **expansion of ACT in rural areas. Variability i**n t**he adaptation of ACT in rural areas has included accommodation by teams to multiple barriers. One way to increase psychiatric professional efficiency in rural areas is with telepsychiatry **and** possibly with rural ACT, but with unknown effects on fidelity and outcomes. Telepsychiatry has been considered a means of expanding** th**e reach of and access to ACT. Concerns abo**ut **the use of telepsychiatry by ACT teams include the psychiatrist's ability to develop a relationship with patients and staff and difficulties observing the patient's entire living environment via telemedicine. The Piedmont Community Services Board (CSB) Program **for** Assertive Community Treatment (PACT) serves patients in southwestern Virginia in collaboration with the Virginia Tech Carilio**n S**chool of Medicine. The Piedmont CSB PACT uses telemedicine to expan**d t**he **tre**ating psychiatrist's reach and contact with PACT patient**s, **increasing the efficiency of the psychiatrist's PACT time. Telemedicine is used for crisis intervention and augmentation of regular ongoing visits. The goals of this project were to mea**sur**e patient, staff, and psychiatrist** co**mfort and **satisfact**ion with the use of telepsychiatry in ACT in addition to monitoring routine outcome measures.  2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

0. **Telephone-adapted Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction (tMBSR) for patients awaiting kidney transplantation**
Background Patients with progressive kidney disease experience increasing physiologic and psychosocial **stress**ors and declining health-related quality of **life** (HRQOL). Methods We conducted a randomized, active-controlled, open-label trial to test whether a **Mind**fulness-ba**sed St**ress ****Reduc**t**ion (**MBSR**) program delivered in a novel workshop-teleconference format wo**uld r**educe symptoms and improve HRQOL in patients awaiting **kidney transplant**ation. Sixty-three transplant candidates were randomized to one of two arms: i) **telephon**e-adap**ted ****MBS**R (tMBSR, an 8-week program of **medit**ation and yoga); or ii**) a tele**phone-based support group (tSupport). Participants completed self-report questionnaires at baseline, post-intervention, and after 6-months. Anxiety, measured by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) post-intervention served as the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included: depression, sleep quality, pain, fatigue, and HRQOL assessed by SF-12 Physical and Mental Component Summaries (PCS, MCS). Results 55 patients (age 54  12 yrs) attended their assigne**d pr**ogram (tMBSR, n = 27; tSupport, n = 28). 49% of patients had elevated anxiety at baseline. Changes in anxiety were small and did not differ by treatment group post-intervention or at follo**w-up**. However, tMBSR significantly improved mental HRQOL at follow-up: + 6.2 points on the MCS - twice the minimum clinically important difference (95% CI: 1.66 to 10.8, P = 0.01). A l**arge** percentage of tMBSR participants ( 90%) practi**ced **mindfulness and reported it help**ful fo**r stress management. Conclusions **Neit**her mindfulness training nor a support group resulted in clinically meaning**ful re**ductions in anxiety. In **cont**rast, finding that tMBSR was more effective than tSupport for bolstering mental HRQOL during the wait fo**r a kidney transp**lant is encouraging and warrants further investigation.

**Mind**fulness-based **stress** ****reduc**t**ion (**MBSR**) has demonstrated benefits **for st**ress-related symptoms; however, for patients with burdensome treatment regimens, multiple co-morbidities and mobility impairment, time and travel requirements pose barriers** to **MBSR training. Purpose: To describe the design, rationale and feasibility results of Journeys to Wellness, a clinical trial** of **mindfulness training delivered in a novel workshop and teleconference format. The trial aim is** to r**educe symptoms and improve quality of **life** in people waiting for a **kidney transplant**. Methods: The standard** 8-w**eek MBSR program was reconfigured for delivery as two in-person workshops separated in time by six weekly teleco**nfer**ences (tMBSR). A time and attention comparison condition (tSupport) was created using the workshop-**telephon**e format. Feasibility resul**ts: Kidney transp**lant candidates (N. =. 63) were random**ly a**ssigned to tMBSR or tSupport: 87% (n. =. 55) attended . 1 class, and for these, attendance wa**s hi**gh (6.6. . 1.8 tMBSR and 7.0. . 1.4 tSupport sessions). Fidelity monitoring found that all treatment elements were delivered as planned and few technical problems occurred. Patients in both groups reported high treatment **sati**sfaction, but more tMBSR (83%) than tSupport (43%) participants expected their intervention to be quite a bit or extremely useful for managing their health. Symptoms and quality** of **life outcomes collected before (baseline, 8. weeks and 6. months) an**d after kidney tr**ansplantation (2, 6 and 12. months) will be analyzed **for **efficacy.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), **stress**-related chronic diseases are the main source of death in developed countries. During the last decade, e-mental health, telepsychology or telepsychiatry interventions are showing its growing potential due to the gradual global adoption of the internet and mobile phone technologies. A significant number of studies have concluded that **mind**fulness helps to **reduc**e physical and psychological symptoms** of st**ress related to various health concerns and that it is a psychological skill that can be trained. The purpose of this online research study is to gather the participants socio-demographics as **well a**s stress **and **mindfulness data during an** onl**ine mindfulness training program. Sustained attention and t**he s**tate of mindfulness experienced in single **medit**ation sessions are also tracked and stored. Correlational analysis yielded to a statistically significant relationship between hig**h scor**es in stress an**d lo**w scores in mindfulness facets (p <.001) and between state a**nd t**rait aspects of mindfulness (p <.01).  2012 Interactive Media Institute. eid: 2-s2.0-85019601802

Objective: Despite the scientific evidence, most families of people with **schizophrenia** in Europe never receive a carer education programme. We evaluated whether a carer education **cours**e delivered by telepsychiatry was as effective as a carer educat**ion c**ourse delivered in situ. Method: We delivered the carer ed**ucati**on course **for schizophr**enia simultaneously to a carers group in **rural** north west Ireland (**remot**e) via three ISDN lines and live to a carers group in a city (host). We compared knowledge gains using the Knowledge Questionnaire before and** afte**r each course. Results: Fifty-six carers of peop**le with schiz**ophrenia participated in the trial. At baseline, participants at **the r**emote and host centers did not differ in terms of know**ledge about s**chizophr**enia.** After the course, carers at both centers improved significantly and the knowledge gains between groups were equivalent at 6. weeks. Conclusion: Telepsychiatry can deliver effective carer education p**rogrammes abo**ut schizophrenia and may provide one solution to bridging the chasm between scientific evidence and clinical reality.  2010 Elsevier Masson SAS. eid: 2-s2.0-79960471492
1. **Travel distance and the use of inpatient care among patients with schizophrenia**
This study examines the variations in the use of inpatient care that can be explained by travel distance among patients with **schizophrenia** living in Taiwan. Data were drawn from the Psychiatric Inpatient Medical Claims Database. We used mediation analysis and multilevel analysis to identify associations. Travel distance did not significantly account for lower readmission rates after an index admission, but significantly explained the longer length of stay of an index admission by 9.3 days (P < 0.001, 85% of variation) between **remot**e and **non-r**emote regions. Policies are discussed aimed at reducing the impact of travel distance on **rural** mental health care through inter-disciplinary collaboration and telepsychiatry.  2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC. eid: 2-s2.0-50249151884
2. **What is the potential for social networks and support to enhance future telehealth interventions for people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia: A critical interpretive synthesis**
Background: Digital technologies are increasingly directed at improved monitoring, management and treatment of mental health. However, their potential contribution to social networks and self-management **support** for people diagnosed with a serious mental **ill**ness has rarely been considered. This review and meta-synthesis aimed to examine the processes of engagement and perceived relevance and appropriateness of telehealth interventions for people with a diagnosis of **schizophrenia**. The review addresses three key questions. How is the use of digital communications technologies framed in the professional psychiatric literature? How might the recognised benefits of telehealth translate to people with a diagnosis** of schizophr**enia? What is the user perspective concerning Internet information and communication technologies?Methods: A critical interpretive synthesis (CIS) of published findings from quantitative and qualitative studies of telehealth interventions for people with a diagn**osis of schiz**ophrenia. Results: Most studies were of an exploratory nature. The professional dis**cours**e about the use of different technologies was overlain by concerns with s**urv**eillance and control, **focu**sing on the Internet as a potential site of risk and danger. The critical synthesis of findings showed that the **key **focus of the available studies was on the delivery of existing traditional approaches (e.g. improving medications adherence, provision of medical information about the condition, symptom monitoring and cognitive behavioural therapy). Even though it was clear that the Internet has considerable potential in terms of accessing and utilising **lay sup**port, the potential of communication technologies in mobilising of resources for personal self-management **or peer** support was a relatively absent or h**idde**n a focus of the available studies. Conclusions: Based on an interpretive synthesis of available studies, people with a d**iagnosis of s**chizophrenia or psychosis use the Internet primarily for the purposes of disclosure and information gathering. Empowerment, regulation a**nd **surveillance emerged as the key dimensions of engagement (or not) with telehealth interventions. The findings suggest that telehealth interventions are disproportionately used by particular patient groups (e.g.women, people who are employed). Further research needs to ascertain the mechanisms by which telehealth interventions may be potentially beneficial or harmful for engagement and management to people with** a diagnosis **of schizophrenia.  2013 Daker-White and Rogers; licensee BioMed Central Ltd. eid: 2-s2.0-84886733528
3. **Developing Texting for Relapse Prevention: A Scalable mHealth Program for People with Schizophrenia and Schizoaffective Disorder**
Symptom relapse in people with **schizophrenia** and schizoaffective disorder is common and has a negative impact on the **cours**e of **ill**ness. Here, we describe the development of Texting for Relapse Prevention, a scalable, cost-effective text messaging relapse prevention program that queries patients' "early warning signs" daily. Results of development **focu**s groups and content advisory teams with 25 patients and 19 providers suggest that patients were enthusiastic about the program and thought that receiving daily messages about their symptoms would help them feel **support**ed. Providers also were positive about the idea but worried that the program might interfere with patient-provider communication if patients thought that the messages were coming from providers. Patients found the content positive and actionable. The program was improved to address this feedback. This iterative development process that included multiple stakeholders ensured that the program is feasible and acceptable to both patients and providers.  Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Objective: We aimed to determine characteristics of patients receiving **Medicar**e-funded face-to-face consultations by psychiatrists in a **rural** service with an established telemedicine service. Methods: For this study, 55 case-managed patients from f**our r**ural community mental health teams in South Australia provided information through questionnaires regarding psychological symptoms, quality of life, body mass index (BMI) and gave access to th**eir Med**icare data. Results: In a logistic regression, it was found that being younger was more likely associated** with a** Medicare psychiatric consultation (p<0.05). Participants with at least one recorded** visit **to a Medicare psychiatrist consultation also tended to have lower levels of psychological distress at the end of the 4-year period, have a higher BMI, and more general practitioner consultations. Conclusion: The study provides clinicians and policy makers with preliminary information on the subtle differences in clinical profile of p**atients** seen by Medicare-funded psychiatrists within an established state-managed telepsychiatry service.

1. **Geriatric Telepsychiatry: Systematic Review and Policy Considerations**
Telemental health (TMH) for older patients has the potential to increase access to geriatric specialists, reduce travel times for patients and providers, and reduce ever growing healthcare costs. This systematic review article examines the literature regarding psychiatric assessment and treatment via telemedicine for geriatric patients. English language literature was searched using Ovid Medline, PubMed, and PsycINFO with search terms including telemedicine, telemental health, aging, and dementia. Abstracts were reviewed for relevance based on inclusion criteria. Multiple study types were reviewed, including open label, qualitative and randomized controlled trial study designs. Data was compiled regarding participants, study intervention, and outcomes. 76 articles were included. TMH was shown to be feasible and well accepted in the areas of inpatient and nursing **home** consultation, cognitive testing, dementia diagnosis and treatment, depression in integrated and collaborative care models, and psychotherapy. There is limited data on cost-effectiveness of TMH in the elderly. This article will discuss the current barriers to broader implementation of telemedicine for geriatric patients including reimbursement from the **Medicar**e progr**am. Med**icare reimbursement for telemedicine is limited to **rural** areas, which does not allow for the widespread **develop**ment of telemedicine progra**ms. All** Medicare beneficiaries would benefit from increased access to telemedicine services, not only those living** in r**ural areas. As many elderly and disabled individuals have mobility proble**ms, **home-based telemedicine services should also be made available. There are efforts in Congress to expand the **coverag**e of these ser**vices u**nder Medicare, but strong advocacy will be needed to **ensur**e these efforts are successful.  2018 eid: 2-s2.0-85056225259
2. **Developing Telemental Health Partnerships Between State Medical Schools and Federally Qualified Health Centers: Navigating the Regulatory Landscape and Policy Recommendations**
Background: Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) deliver care to 26 million Americans living in underserved areas, but few offer telemental health (TMH) services. The social missions of FQHCs and publicly funded state medical schools create a compelling argument for the **develop**ment of TMH partnerships. In this paper, we share our experience and recommendations from launching TMH partnerships between 12 **rural** FQHCs and 3 state medical schools. Experience: There was consensus that medical school TMH providers should practice as part of the FQHC team to promote integration, enhance quality and safety, and **ensur**e financial sustainability. For TMH providers to practice and bill as FQHC providers, the following issues must be addressed: (1) credentialing and privileging the TMH providers at the FQHC, (2) expanding FQHC Scope of Project to include telepsychiatry, (3) remote access to medical records, (4) insurance credentialing/paneling, billing, and supplemental payments, (5) contracting with the medical school, and (6) indemnity **coverag**e for TMH. Recommendations: We make recommendations to both state medical schools and FQHCs about how to overcome existing barriers to TMH partnerships. We also make recommendations about changes to policy that would mitigate the impact of these barriers. Specifically, we make recommendations to the Centers for **Medicar**e and **Medicaid** about insurance credentialing, facility fees, eligibility of TMH encounters for supplemental payments, **and Med**icare eligibility rules for TMH billing by FQHCs. We also make recommendations to the Health Resources and Services Administration about restrictions on adding telepsychiatry to the FQHCs Scope of Project and the eligibility of TMH providers for indemn**ity cov**erage under the Federal Tort Claims Act.  2018 The Authors.

3. **Technology Tools: Increasing Our Reach in National Surveillance of Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities**
Challenges in collecting comprehensive health surveillance data on people with intellectual and **develop**mental disabilities (IDD) are numerous. A number of important issues and strategies are discussed in the articles contained in this special issue of Intellectual **and Dev**elopmental Disabilities. In this article, we focus on the advances and tools available in the area of technology. We explore a number of possible sources including accessing big data such as analyzing health information contained in **Medicaid** and **Medicar**e health databases. We also discuss some of the possibilities afforded to us by complementing Medic**aid/Med**icare database information with health information available in the myriad of electronic health records. Lastly, we explore other technologies available that might yield valuable health supports and information, including wearable devices, remote supports and other smart **home** technologies, telehealth and telepsychiatry, as well as looking at ways to access other technologies that collect health information (e.g., glucometer, health apps, connected exercise devices, etc.). eid: 2-s2.0-85072759544

Telemedicine has been used in **rural** settings for more than 25 years to provide services for patients and educational opportunities for practitioners. There is little documentation in the literature about using telepsychiatry for **supervis**ing psychiatric nurse practitioners. This article discusses **the supe**rvision **experi**ences of two groups of psychiatric nurse practitioners. One group of four nurses met weekly with a psychiatrist on-site. The other group of four nurses, working in three different clinical locations in Maine, met via a two-way interactive television connection with a psychiatrist based in Boston, Massachusetts.

1. **Psychotherapy supervision conducted via videoconferencing: A qualitative study of users' experiences**
The 70 h of mandatory psychotherapy **supervis**ion for psychiatry residents in Norway is designed to develop insight into the therapeutic **relationship**. Essential in fulfilling the intentions of psychother**apy supe**rvision is, for example, the ability to openly express and utilize personal **experi**ences, emotions, and reactio**ns. Six **supervision pairs - six candida**tes and **two supervisors - participated in a study to **evalu**ate the **qualit**y of th**e psycho**therapy super**vision p**rocess when supervisors and candidates communicate by means of interactive **audiovisu**al videoconferencing (VC). Each candida**te and t**heir respective sup**ervisors** participated in 10 supervised sessions, with 5 VC-based and 5 face-to-face sessions alternating every other session weekly. The part of the study reported in this article is based** on qu**alitative interviews conducted at the conclusion of the 60 sessions. The article concludes th**at the q**uality of psychotherapy supervision can be satisfactorily maintained by using VC (384 kbit/sec) for up to 50% of** the 70 **h of required psychotherapy supervision. The prerequisite for this estimate is that the pair in question has met face-to-face and establishe**d a relation**ship characterized by mutual trust and respect. The study further indicates that the limitations imposed by VC may, paradoxically enough, stimulate the development of insights and communication abilities that contribute pos**itively ****to th**e quality of psychotherapy supervision, also in a face-to-face setting. The most obvious implications of the study are the potentials provided by new technology for implementing decentralized models for recruiting and educating psychiatrists. eid: 2-s2.0-0031751739

A Shortage in qualified psychotherapy **supervis**ors in **rural** Norway motivated a study **evalu**ating the **qualit**y of **the supe**rvision proce**ss when **supervisors and trainees communicated by interactive **audiovisu**al videoconferencing (VC). Six **trainee **and supervisor pairs participated in five alternating VC based and face-to-face sessions. The pairs had previously established a good face-to-face **relationship**. Self-report data of **the qu**ality of communication, the alliance and disturbing **elements** in the supervision sessions were collected from specially designed questionnaires completed after each session. Independent ratings of the videotaped sessi**ons an**d qualitative interviews conducted at the end of the study were also conducted. The only significant difference between the two conditions was that trainees scored higher on disturbing factors under VC conditions. Recommendations for use of VC are provided in light of the findings. eid: 2-s2.0-0032776019

Background: In November 2017, the Australian government approved reimbursement for psychology consultations conducted by **videoconfer**ence under the Better Access initiative to address inequitable access of mental health services across regions in Australia. Objective: This project uses publically available activity data from the Medicare Benefits Scheme to quantify the uptake** of videoco**nference for psychology resulting from the initiative change. Methods: Data were extracted from the Medicare Benefits Schedule item reports using the item codes for standard consultations and the new item co**des for vid**eoconference consultations. Activity data from 2 years before and the **first** year of the change to the Better Access initiative were compared to examine th**e uptake of** videoconference for psychology. Data were stratified by allied health profession, sex, age and state jurisdiction. Results: In the 1-year period after the introductio**n of reimbu**rsed videoconference consultations, approximately 5.7 million in-person con**sultations **and 4141 videoconference consultations were funded by** Medicare i**n Australia. Videoconference consultations comprised 0.07% of the total consultations performed in that 1-year period and showed an increased trajectory. The results can guide future research into evaluating the clinical outcomes of pati**ents via bo**th in-person and videoconferen**ce delivery** modes. Conclusions: Videoconference mental health services were used in **the f**irst year that they were available, although they only accounted for a small percentage of all mental health consultations provided by allied health professionals. This finding lays the foundation for future work which could examine the effectiveness of the scheme in reducing inequity and investigating the economic benefits of the expanded initiative to the government and society.  2019 ISPORThe professional society for health economics and outcomes research eid: 2-s2.0-85073756466
1. **The validation of a telepresence scale for psychotherapy delivered in videoconference**
The **Telepres**ence in **Videoconfer**ence Scale (TVS) was developed and tested over several years, but its psychometric properties have not been formally documented. The aim of this study was to examine the reliability and factor structure of the TVS. A total of 157 participants completed the scale followin**g a videoco**nference session with a psychotherapist delivered over four clinical trials. The TVS was submitted to an exploratory factor analysis using the Principal Components method and a Varimax rotation. Three factors were found: Physical **Presenc**e, Interaction, and Absorption. Inter-item correlations and Cronbachs alpha were conducted to measure the internal consistency of the scale. Discriminant **valid**ity and converg**ent v**alidity were assessed with the Immersive Tendencies Questionnaire and the Distance Communication Comfort Scale. The results suggest that this revised version of **the Tele**pres**ence in Vid**eoconference Scale is a relia**ble a**nd valid tool to measure clients sense** of pre**sence during psychotherapy sessions del**ivered over** videoconference technologies. Future research could examine whether this scale may be used in different contexts and with different populations.  2018, Interactive Media Institute. All rights reserved. eid: 2-s2.0-85067878343
2. **Telepresence experienced in videoconference varies according to emotions involved in videoconference sessions**
Previous studies have linked **telepres**ence to the strength of the therapeutic **relationship** experienced during telepsychotherapy. This finding comes as a surprise for many people who have been involved in a teleconference meeting, wh**ere tele****presenc**e is often considered weak. The aim of this study is to (re)evaluate the impact of emotional engage**ment on ****telepre**sence. Participants were randomly assigned to one of the two conditions: (a) emotionally charged **verbal** exchange **first** (followed by a more neut**ral ve**rbal exchange), or (b) emotionally **neutra**l verbal excha**nge f**irst (followed by an emotiona**lly ch**arged verbal exchange). A distraction task was performed **betwee**n the two verbal exchanges in videofoncerence. **Result**s showed that verbal exchanges involving stronger emotio**ns incre****ase tel**epresence. These results **may expl****ain why** telepresence is so high in telepsychotherapy. eid: 2-s2.0-83455200034
3. **Factors influencing mental health providers intention to use telepsychotherapy in First Nations communities**
Telemental health is the use of information and communications technologies and broadband networks to deliver mental health services and support wellness. Although numerous studies have demonstrated the efficiency and utility of telemental health, certain barriers may impede its implementation, including the attitudes of mental health service providers. The current study draws on the technology acceptance model (TAM) to understand the role of mental health service providers attitudes and perceptions of telemental health (psychotherapy delivered via **videoconfer**encing) on their intention to use this technology with their patients. A sample of 205 broadly defined mental health service providers working on 32 **First** Nations reserves in the province of Quebec completed the questionnaire adapted to assess TAM for telepsychotherapy. Confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling provided evidence for the factor **valid**ity and reliability of the TAM in this sample. The key predictor of the intention to use telepsychotherapy was not mental health providers attitude toward telepsychotherapy, nor how much they expected this service to be complicated to use, but essentially how useful they expect it to be for th**eir F**irst Nations patients. If telemental health **via videoco**nferencing is to be impleme**nted **in First Nations communities, it is essential to thoroughly demonstrate its utility to mental health providers. Perceived usefulness will have a positive impact on attitudes toward this technology, and perceived ease of use will positively **influenc**e perceived usefulness. Cultural issues specific to the populations receiving telemental health services may be more efficiently addressed from the angle of perceived usefulness.  2013, SAGE Publications.

4. **Assessing presence in videoconference telepsychotherapies: A complementary qualitative study on breaks in telepresence and intersubjectivity co-construction processes**
Assessing the efficacy of online psychotherapies is an important issue in eHealth. In the present research, we used an innovative approach to focus on the characteristics of breaks in interactions that impact the acceptance of the psychotherapy setting of a telepsychotherapy delivered in **videoconfer**ence. We also tried to build a method to assess if the level of **telepres**ence in online interactions would be **influenc**ed by the acceptance of the psychotherapy setting. Sessions of psychotherapy delivered** in videoco**nference to two adults receiving CBT and two others receiving psychodynamic psychotherapy were analyzed to test the method. In this paper, we describe the methodology and illustrate preliminary results. An interactional grid was used to analyze **verbal** and **non-ve**rbal interactions, physical and social **presenc**e, and breaks in acceptance of the telepsychotherapy setting. This led to observe the interactional process of construction of enonciative** co-pre**sence, fundamental to allow people to experience intersubjectivity. This study is the **first** step towards a better understanding of the level of acceptance of the technological setting by patients and **its infl**uence on the interactions between them and psychologists.  2018, Interactive Media Institute.

5. **Telepsychology and video-interview [Tlpsychologie et visioconsultation]**
Telepsychology is an emerging field in present psychotherapeutic practices. There are different methods available to carry out psychotherapy at a distance. These methods more or less involve the participant's bodies. **Videoconfer**ence is a technology that permits to users to see each other. This has an **influenc**e on interactions established at a distance. Video-interview is a method based on the adaptation online of the classical clinical face-to-face interview framework. Objectives: 1. Adapt the clinical interview framework online. Conceptualize a prototype device: http://www.ipsy.fr. 2. Compare the **relationship** between a patient and a psychologist during a face-to-face interview in a classical framework and on the online platform. Materials and methods: The sample of our study was composed of two groups of four participants. Participants were adults and did not have altera**ted relation**ship to reality. We compared the video-interviews realized with two groups of participants: one previously handled in a traditional framework and the other solely met through the platform. We used a qualitative method to analyze video-interviews recordings: a 12 items theme based grid. We were very attentive to ethical rules and data security all along the platform development process and after that in the use of the device. Results: Psychological processes activated in the context of video-interview are similar to those observed in traditional clinical consults, for both groups of participants. These results also show the tierce function of the device in t**he dual rela**tionship between the patient and the clinical psychologist. These results open a reflexion on the process relative to the creation of an inte**rsubjective **relationship in telepsychotherapy. It seems that the study of the sense of **presenc**e might be useful to understand intersubjectivity in telepsychotherapy and more gener**ally in digi**tal relationships. Conclusions: A methodological work is still necessary to define telepsychotherapy. This work should include an ethical dimension, in order to preserve online users safety. Telepsychotherapy has many advantages, for example, it permits a better access to psychotherapy for isolated people. These people can be isolated geographically, or they might have mobility issues, or even psychological issues making it difficult for them to go in the psychologist office. Present boundaries are technical, but also methodological, with the lack of definition of an ethical and methodological framework of telepsychotherapy in France. We also notice the lack of longitudinal, quantitative and qualitative data on evaluation of **telepsychotherapi**es efficacity. Also, some fundamental data should be explored theoretically, as the sense** of pre**sence.  2018 Elsevier Masson SAS eid: 2-s2.0-85042157143

Objective: **Neuropsycholog**ical **test** **batteri**es are administered **in person** to assess **cognit**ive function in both clinical and research settings. However, in-person **administr**ation holds a number of logistical challenges that makes it difficult to use in large or remote populations or for multiple serial assessments over time. The purpose of this descriptive study was to determine whether a telephone-administe**red neuropsych**ologi**cal **test battery correlated well with in**-per**son testing. Methods: Fifty English-speaking patients without dementia, over 70 years old, and part of a cohort of patients in a prospective cohort study examin**ing co**gnitive outcomes following elective surgery were enrolled in this study. Five well-va**lidated neurop**s**ycho**logical tests were administered by telephone to each participant by a trained interviewer within 24 weeks of the most recent in-pe**rson** interview. Tests included the Hopk**ins **Verbal Learning Test-Revised, Digit Span, Category Fluency, Phonemic Flu**ency**, and Boston Naming Test. A **Genera**l Cognitive Performance composite score was ca**lcul**ated from individual subtest scores as a Z-score. Results: Mean age was 74.9 years (SD = 4.1), 66% female, and 4% non-White. Mean and interquartile distributions of telephone scores were similar to in-person **scor**es. Correlation analysis of test scores revealed significant correlations between telephone and in-pe**rson** results for each individual subtest, as well as for the overall composite score. A BlandAltman plot revealed **no b**ias or trends in scoring for either t**est admin**istration type. Conclusions: In this descriptive study, the te**leph**one v**ersion of a ne**uropsychological test battery correlated well with the in-person version and may provide a feasible supplement in clinical and research applications.

1. **A Flexible and Integrated System for the Remote Acquisition of Neuropsychological Data in Stroke Research**
Background: **Neuropsycholog**ical **test**ing is a central aspect of stroke research because it provides critical information about the **cognit**ive-behavioral status of stroke survivors, as well as the diagnosis and treatment of stroke-related disorders. Stand**ard neuropsych**ological methods rely upon face-to-face interactions between a patient and researcher, which creates geographic and logistical barriers that impede research progress and treatment advances. Introduction: To overcome these barriers, we created a flexible and integrated system for the remote acquisi**tion of neurop**sychological data (RAND). The system we developed has a secure architecture that permits collaborative videoconferencing. The system supports shared audiovisual feeds that can provide continuous virtual interaction between a participant and researcher throughou**t a **testing session. Shared presentation and computing controls can be used to deliver auditory and** vis**ual test items adapted from **standard** face-to-face materials or execute computer-based assessments. Spoken and manual responses can be acquired, and the components of the session can be recorded for offline data analysis. Materials and Methods: To **evalu**ate its feasibility, our RAND system was used to administer a spee**ch-l**anguage test battery to 16 stroke survivors with a variety of communication, sensory, and motor impairments. The sessions were initiated virtually without prior face-to-face instruction in the RAN**D te**chnology or test batter**y. Results: Ne**uropsychological data were successfully acquired from all participants, including those with limited technology experience, and those with a communication, sensory, or motor impairment. Furthermore, participants indicated a high level of satisfaction with the RAND system and the remote assessment that it permits. Conclusions: The results indicate the feasibility of using the RAND system for vir**tual home-base**d neuropsychological assessment without prior face-to-face contact between a participant and researcher. Because our RAND system architecture uses off-the-shelf technology and software, it can be duplicated without specialized expertise or equipment. In sum, our RAND system offers a readily available and promising alternat**ive to face-to**-face neuropsychological assessment in stroke research.

2. **Videoconference-based mini mental state examination: A validation study**
Background: **Neuropsycholog**ical **test**ing is a prime criterion of good practice to document **cognit**ive deficits in a rapidly aging population. Telecommunication technologies may overcome limitations related** to **test **administr**ation. We compared performance of the Italian videoconference-based version of the Mini Mental State Examination (VMMSE) with performance of the **standard** MMSE administered face-to-face (F2F), to **valid**ate the Italian version of the 28-item VMMSE. Materials and Methods:** To v**alidate the Italian version of the VMMSE, we compared its performance w**ith stan**dard F2F. The sample (n=342) was administered three VMMSEs within 6 weeks af**ter **F2F testing. We identified the optimal cutoff through the receiver operating characteristic curve, as well as the VMMSE consistency through inter- and intrarater reliability (Inter/RR and Intra/RR) analysis. Results: We found high levels of sensitivity and specificity for the optimal VMMSE cutoff identification and an accuracy of 0.96 (95% confidence interval 0.94-0.98). Intra/RR and inter/RR were highly significant. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that VMM**SE is** a valid instrument in clinical and research screening and monitoring of subjects affected** by co**gnitive disorders. This study shows a significant correlation between videoconference assessment and the F2F one, providing an important impetus to expand studies and the knowledge about the usefulness of tele-assistance services. Our findings have important implications for both longitudinal assistance and clinical care of demented patients.  2013 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-84889690302
3. **A Pilot Trial of Neuropsychological Evaluations Conducted via Telemedicine in the Veterans Health Administration**
Introduction: Many veterans live in rural areas distant from Veterans Affairs Medical Centers (VAMCs) and receive primary medical care from community-based outpatient clinics (CBOCs). These veterans often must travel great distances to the nearest VAMC for **neuropsycholog**ical **evalu**ations, resulting in poor access to care, travel reimbursement costs, fee-ba**sis e**valuations of uncontrolled quality, and driving safety concerns. Return trips for feedback compound complications. Accordingly, we initiated a pilot trial** of neuropsych**o**logic**al evaluation and feedback via telemedicine (i.e., clinical videoconferencing). Subjects and Methods: Participants were veterans refer**red for neurop**s**ychol**ogical evaluation from a rural CBOC 115 miles from the regional VAMC. All veterans were given the ch**oice **to undergo evaluation at the CBOC via telemedicine or in-person at the VAMC. Telemedicine equipment allowed presentation of digitized material with simultaneous patient observation. **Test**ing materials were organized in numbered folders and given to veterans by CBOC clerks i**mmedi**ately prior to evaluation. Clerks returned completed materials via facsimile. Results: Fifteen veterans from the rural CBOC we**re seen f**or ne****uropsychological evaluatio**n. Ei**ght chose telemedic**ine e**valuation. Groups based on evaluation modality appeared similar on demographics, referral basis, resulting neuropsychiatric diagnoses, and follow-through on recommendations. No significant technical or clinical difficulties were encountered, and veterans reported satisfaction with telemedicine. All veterans requested feedback via telemedicin**e**. Con**clusions**: Neuropsychological evaluation via telemedicine is feasi**ble a**nd appears comparable to in-person evaluation. Experiences are encouraging and consistent with the broader literature on the acceptance of and satisfaction with clinical videoconferencing. Future studies will assess possible psychometric issues in clinical populations.  Copyright 2012, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2012. eid: 2-s2.0-84869001703
4. **Development of a novel diagnostic system for a telepsychiatric application: A pilot validation study**
Background: A net-based, decision support system for diagnostic assessment and management of psychiatric disorders, developed as part of a telepsychiatry service, which aims to deliver mental health care to underserved population of remote areas in India is described. This paper presents the development and preliminary results of diagnostic **valid**ation of the application, intended for use among adult patients. The bilingual (English and Hindi) diagnostic tool consists of a core diagnostic section comprising a screening sub-module and criteria-based diagnostic sub-modules for 18 adult psychiatric disorders, and additional sections covering background information. The diagnostic tool of the application was examined among 100 consecutive consenting adult outpatients, by comparing it with detailed semi-structured clinical assessments led by a consultant psychiatrist, on accuracy of diagnoses generated, and examining the feasibility of its use. Results: The screening sub-module had high sensitivity and high specificity, low positive predictive values, but high negative predictive values for most disorders. For the diagnostic sub-modules, there was moderate (kappa = 0.4-0.6), to substantial agreement (kappa > 0.6) between diagnoses generated by the tool and consultants' diagnoses, for all the disorders except dysthymia. Sensitivity was high barring a few disorders. Specificity was high for all the disorders, positive predictive values were acceptable to high for most disorders, and negative predictive values were consistently high. Completion rate was 100%; average time taken was five minutes for screening alone, and 30 minutes for complete assessment with screening and criteria-based **evalu**ation. A majority of the patients, their relatives, and interviewers were satisfied with the interview. Conclusions: The preliminary results indicated that despite some limitations, the new diagnostic system was reasonably comprehensive, time-efficient and feasible, with an acceptable level of diagnostic accuracy. Hence, it appeared to be suitable for use as a telepsychiatric application.  2014 Malhotra et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd. eid: 2-s2.0-84906923585
5. **Teleneuropsychology: Evidence for video teleconference-based neuropsychological assessment**
The use of videoconference technology to deliver health care diagnostics and treatment continues to grow at a rapid pace. Telepsychiatry and telepsychology applications are well-accepted by patients and providers, and both diagnostic and treatment outcomes have generally been similar to traditional face-to-face interactions. Preliminary applications of videoconference-based **neuropsycholog**ical assessment (**teleneuropsych**ology) have yielded promising results in the feasibility and reliability of several **standard** **test**s, although large-scale studies are lacking. This investigation was conducted to determine the reliability of video teleconference (VTC) **- based neurop**sychological assessment using a brief battery ****of stan**dard ne**uropsychologi**cal **tests commonly used in the **evalu**ation of known or suspected de**ment**ia. Tests included the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Hopkins Verb**al L**earning Test-Revised, Digit Span forward and backward, short for**m Bo**ston Naming Test, Letter and Category Fluency,** and** Clock Drawing. Tests were administered via VTC and in-person to subjects, counterb**alan**ced using alternate test fo**rms and **standard instructions. Two hund**red **two adult subjects were tested in both rural and urban settings, including 83 with **cognit**ive impairment and 119 healthy controls. We found highly similar results across VTC and in-person conditions, with significant intraclass correlations (mean**=.74**; range: 0.55-0.91) between test scores. Findings remained consistent in subjects with or with**out co**gnitive impairment and **in person**s with MMSE scores as low a**s** 15.** VTC-base**d neuropsychological testing is a **valid** and reliable alternative to traditional face-to-face assessment using selected measures. **More** VTC-based studies using additional tests in different populations are need**ed t**o fully explore the utility of this new testing medium.

Objective: Individuals living in **rural** areas die by **suicid**e at higher rates than those living in metropolitan areas. Telemental health interventions prov**ide r**ural **resid**ing individuals with access to needed care. Identifying telemental health clients at **risk** **for su**icide is an important task for clinicians and policymakers. This study evaluated to what** degr**ee rural status and other demographic variables pr**edicte**d suicide **ideat**ion in clients seeking services at a telemental health clinic. Methods: Study participants included 457 low-income clie**nts r**esiding in the medically underserved, geographically diverse Brazos Valley region of Texas. Clients completed the patient health questionnaire during their initial counseling appointment, which assessed **depress**ion s**everit**y and suic**ide i**deation in the 2 weeks prior to asses**sment.** Results: **Suici**de ideation was common among telemental health clients, with approximately 40% of clients in all demographic groups reporting some** recen**t though**ts of **suicide. Rates** of s**uicide ideation did not significantly differ by geographic desig**natio**n (ie, rural/metropolitan status), gender, or race/ethnicity. Howev**er, dep**ression was a** stron**g predictor of** rece**nt suicide ideation. Conclusions: Telemental health programs can effectively connect clinicians wit**h rur**al residing clients who are otherwise isolated from health care services. However, clinicians working in high-need, historically underserved areas should be prepared to** encou**nter a high pr**evale**nce of suicide ideat**ion and** depression. In these regions, clinical and diagnostic f**eature**s may be bette**r ind**icators of suicide ideation than demographic variables.**  201**8 National Rural Health Association eid: 2-s2.0-85063445623
1. **Safety of telemental healthcare delivered to clinically unsupervised settings: A systematic review**
The safety of telemental healthcare delivered to clinically unsupervised settings, such as a personal **resid**ence, must be established to inform policy and further the dissemination of telemental health programs. The aim of this article is to provide an overview of safety issues associated with telemental healthcare and, through a systematic literature review, evaluate the safety of telemental healthcare delivered to unsupervised settings. The review resulted in a total of nine studies that specifically evaluated the delivery of telemental healthcare to unsupervised settings. Six of the nine studies reviewed explicitly described safety plans or specific precautions that could be used if necessary. Two of the nine studies reported events that required the researchers to use safety procedures to effectively respond to concerns they had regarding participant safety. In both of these studies, the issues were resolved with prescribed safety procedures. Recommendations and future directions for the development and evaluation of safety protocols are **discuss**ed.  2010, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-77956136277

The effective assessment and management of **suicid**al patients is an essential component of telehealth-based care. With this article, we describe how we have implemented procedures for the ongoing assessment and management** of su**icide **risk** in a clinical trial that compares in-office treatment to homebased treatment delivered via web-cam to U.S. military service members and veterans with **depress**ion. We describe our safety protocol and how it was adapted from current recommended best practices, published guidelines, and local requirements for managing patient safety during home-based telepractice. We conclude with **discuss**ion of other key safety issues associated with telepractice. The top**ics dis**cussed are relevant to all mental health practitioners who are interested in clinical telepractice services.  2014, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-84928543508

0. **School-Based Telepsychiatry in an Urban Setting: Efficiency and Satisfaction with Care**
Background and Introduction: Given the shortage of **child** psychiatrists in most areas, telepsychiatry may increase accessibility of psychiatric care in schools, in part by improving psychiatrists' efficiency and reach. The current study assessed consumer and provider **satisfact**ion with school-based telepsychiatry versus in-person sessions in 25 urban public schools and compared the efficiency of these service delivery models. Materials and Methods: In total, **714 satis**faction surveys were completed by parents, students, school clinicians, **and c**hild psychiatrists following **initi**al (26.3%) and follow-up (67.2%) visits (6.4% did not indicate type of visit). Most of these surveyed visits were for medication management (69.9%)** or i**nitiation of medication (22%). Efficiency analyses compared time saved via telepsychiatry versus in-person care. Researchers also conducted focus groups with providers to clarify preferences and concerns about telepsychiatry versus in-person visits. Results: Consumers were highly satisfied with both in-person and telepsychiatry-provided school psychiatry services and showed no significant differences in preference. Providers reported both in-person and telepsychiatry were equally effective and showed a slight preference for in-person sessions, citing concerns about ease of video **equip**ment use. Telepsychiatry services were more efficient than in-person services, as commute/setup occupied about 28 psychiatrist hours total per month. Discussion and Conclusions: Findings suggest that students, parents, and school clinicians perceive school-based telepsychiatry positively and equal to on-sit**e car**e. **Child psychiatri**sts have apprehension about us**ing e**quipm**ent, **so equipment training/preparation and provision of technical support are needed. Implications of study findings for telepsychiatry training and implementation in schools are discussed.  2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2020. eid: 2-s2.0-85077861024
1. **Telepsychiatry in a Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Service**
Objectives: To carry out a survey on the use of video conferencing **equip**ment by a **rural** **child** psychiatric multidisciplinary team and to determine what impact the introduction of t**his e**quipment had on service provision. Method: Several aspects were studied including user **satisfact**ion and estimations of **cost** saving, on the basis of avoidance of **travel** to and from the regional base in Galway. A questionnaire was also developed to determine whether alternative contact would have been made if if this new technology were not in place. Results: The results of the **initi**al six months following commencement were investigated. Use** of t**he equipment was attempted 17 times during this **period**. Most members of **the c**hild psychiatry team participated in its use. Visual problems accounted for 66.7% of reported technical difficulty and 88.9% of users rated their level** of satis**facti**on wi**th the equipment as 'Satisfied' or 'Very Satisfied'. Conclusions: Apart from the start**-up **cost implications of **insta**lling this equipment, it satisfied its aim of increasing contact between **the r**ural service and St** Anne**'s Children Ce**ntre **in Galway. The equipment was easy to use and for the most part reliable. eid: 2-s2.0-33750492301
2. **Cost savings of telemedicine utilization for child psychiatry in a rural Kansas community**
The **cost**s of pediatric telemedicine services remain underreported and understudied; however, there is evidence that telepediatric services can** be **cost competitive with traditional ones. For 15 years, the University of Kansas Center for Telemedicine and Telehealth has been providing telemental health outreach from the University of Kansas Medical Center (KUMC). One service site is located in Crawford County, Kansas, which provides telepsychiatry services to **child**ren and **adolesc**ents. The purpose of this study was to exam**ine **the costs of operating the Crawford County site relative to accessing services at KUMC, the likely alternative service lo**cati**on. The cost of **travel** time to parents who accompanied a dependent to either location also was estimated. Patients and parents were examined over a 6-month **period** in 2006. One hundred thirty-two patients received 257 telemedicine psychiatric consultations duri**ng t****his pe**riod. Cost estimates for using the pediatric telemedicine service were assessed for all patients; however,** tra**vel and related costs were collected from a sample of 26 patient-pare**nt d**yads. The estimated costs of services w**ere **obtained using standard cost-ac**coun**ting procedures. An average cost per consultation **in C**rawford County was $168.61. The cost savings** in tr**avel time and other expenses to parents and patients were substantial between use of the county site and KUMC**. Su**btracting average sav**ings i**n travel costs **to p**atients and parents produced an average cost of a telepsychiatry consult in Crawford County of only $30.99. This study was conducted over 6 months with a small number of observations; it should be replicated over a longe**r stud**y period, with more patients,** and** with more data that might capture marginal costs of services.

0. **Effectiveness of an online CBT-i intervention and a face-to-face treatment for shift work sleep disorder: A comparison of sleep diary data**
In western societies, about one in six employees works in shifts. Shiftwork is associated with a **number** of poor somatic and psychological health outcomes, especially **sleep** issues. Higher rates of absenteeism and accidents in the workplace are possible consequences. Still, prevention programs and treatment options that are specifically tailored to shift-workers needs are rare. We devised a 4-week online **cognit**ive behavioral therapy for **insomnia** (CBT-I) intervention (n = 21) and compa**red s**leep outcomes to a face-to-face outpatient treatment for shift-workers (n = 12) **using** a sleep diary and **the E**pworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). In the online sample, measures also included the World Health Organization wellbeing questionnaire (WHO-5) and **the Inso**mnia Severity **Index** (ISI). In the outpatient sample, the Beck **Depress**ion Inventory (BDI-II), the Montgomerysb**erg Dep**ression Rating Scale (MADRS), and** the **Pittsburgh Sleep Qual**ity I**ndex (PSQI) were administered. Results showed signific**ant i**mprovements in sleep efficiency by 7.2% in the online sample and 7.7% in the outpatient sample. However, no significant difference was found in the** rate** of improvement in sleep efficiency across four weeks of treatment between the samples. In the online sample, the wellbeing (WHO**-5) and **insomnia symptoms (ISI) scores were significantly improved following the CBT-I intervention (p < 0.004 and p < 0.002 respectively). In the outpatient sample, symp**toms of** depression (BDI-II and MADRS **scores) **and insomnia symptoms (PSQI scores) improved significantly following the CBT-I intervention. In summary, C**BT-I **significantly improved sleep efficiency in both the online and outpatient samples, in addition to wellbei**ng, symp**toms of in**somnia,** and depression. The findings of this study demonstrate online CBT-I as a feasible ap**proach f**or treating insomnia in shift-workers. Future randomized controlled trials are needed.  2019 by the authors.

1. **The Sleep Or Mood Novel Adjunctive therapy (SOMNA) trial: A study protocol for a randomised controlled trial evaluating an internet-delivered cognitive behavioural therapy program for insomnia on outcomes of standard treatment for depression in men**
Background: **Insomnia** is a significant risk factor for **depress**ion onset, can result in more disabl**ing dep**ressive illness, and is a common residual symptom following treatment cessation that can increase the risk of relapse. Internet-based **cognit**ive behavioural therapy **for inso**mnia has demonstrated efficacy and acceptability to men who are less likely than women to seek help in standard care. We aim to evaluate whether internet delive**red co**gnitive behavioural ther**apy for **insomnia as an adjunct to a s**tandard** depression therapeutic plan can lead to improved mood outcomes. Methods/Design: Male participants aged 50 years or more, meeting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders criteria for cu**rrent M**ajor Depressive Episode and/or Dysthymia and se**lf-repor**ted insomnia symptoms, will be screened to participate in a single-centre double-blind randomised controlled trial with two parallel groups involving adjunctive internet-de**livere**d cognitive behaviou**ral ther**apy for insomnia and an internet-based control program. The trial will con**sist of **a nine-week insomnia intervention period with a six-month follo**w-up per**iod. During the insomnia intervention period participants **will ha**ve their depression management coordinated by a psychiatrist using stand**ard gui**deline-based depression treatments. The study will be conducted in urban New South Wales, Australia, where 80 participants from primary and secondary care and direct from the local community will be recruited. The primary outcome is ch**ange in** the severity of depressive symptoms from baseline to week 12. Discussion: This study will provide evidence on whether a widely accessible, evidence-based, interne**t-deli**vered cognit**ive beha**vioural therapy for insomnia intervention can lead to greater improvements **than st**andard treatment for depression alone, in a group who traditionally do not readily access psychotherapy. The study is designed to establish effect size, feasibility and processes associated with implementing e-health solutions alongside standard clinical care, to warrant undertaking a larger more definitive clinical trial.

2. **Feasibility of Group Cognitive-Behavioral Treatment of Insomnia Delivered by Clinical Video Telehealth**
Background: Clinical video telehealth provides a means for increasing access to psychotherapy. **Insomnia** is prevalent, is associated with a **number** of negative sequelae, and can be effectively managed with **cognit**ive behavioral treatment** of inso**mnia (CBT-I). Telehealth technologies can provide a means for increasing access to CBT-I. Materials and Methods: T**he Tele-**Insomnia program is a Veterans Health Administration (VHA) initiative in which CBT-I is delivered in a group format by telehealth. Veterans received six weekly sessions of group CBT-I, com**pleting **the Insomnia Severity **Index** (ISI) and daily **sleep** **diari**es throughout treatment. Paired-samples t-tests were used to examine differences in each measure from the first to the last session of treatment. Results: There were statistically and clinically significant improvements in the ISI and **all s**leep diary variables with the exception o**f tot**al sleep time. Video quality was excellent, and there were few connectivity problems. Conclusions: Clinical video telehealth technology can be used to deliver group CBT-I in a manner that produces clinically significant improvement. This model is scalable and has been used to develop a national clinical telehealth program.  Copyright 2016, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2016. eid: 2-s2.0-85002882926

1. **Advances in cognitive-behavioral therapy for youth with anxiety disorders: A brief summary**
**Cognit**ive **behavior**al therapy (**CBT**) has burgeoned as the leader in psychosocial treatments for anxious children and **adolesc**ents. Despite the established efficacy** of** CBT for **youth** with anxiety, there is a disparity amongst individuals and families in need of services, and accessibility to qualified practitioners who can effectively deliver empirically supported treatments. Additionally, a substantial number of children either do not respond at** al**l to CBT or do not achieve sustained improvement. As a result, recent research in the area of childhood anxiety disorders focuses on extending treatment **del**ivery of CBT to families who may not have direct access to trained clinicians, and expanding treatment** to y**outh with comorbid conditions and treatment non-responders. This paper provides a preferably brief overview of research on advancements in the delivery** of co**gnit**ive-beha**vioral therapy for **anxio**us youth, discusses practical considerations, and highlights the current state of intervention research in this area. Specifically, the goals of this literature review are to consider innovative** ad**aptations of CBT **for a**nxious youth in the last decade with a particular focus on: (a) computer and Internet-delivered interventions and clinician training platforms; (b) the potential of videoteleconferencing service delivery methods; (c) treatment personalization via modular interventions targeting individual strengths and addressing responsivity to treatment; and, (d) transdiagnostic** appr**oaches for youth with anxiety and comorbid disorders.

2. **Guided Internet-Based Self-Help Intervention for Social Anxiety Disorder With Videoconferenced Therapist Support**
We describe the development of a novel, Internet-based, self-help intervention for social anxiety disorder (**SAD**) in adults, and report data on the preliminary efficacy of the program when administered with minimal therapist support delivered via a common videoconferencing platform. Participants (n=13) completed the intervention, which consists of 8 weekly modules and a brief weekly videoconferenced check-in with a therapist. The intervention program is derived from an acceptance-based **CBT** program that utilizes traditional **behavior**al interventions (e.g., exposure) within the context of a model emphasizing mindful awareness and psychological acceptance of distressing subjective experiences. Assessments revealed that participants experienced a significant reduction** in** SAD symptoms and improvements in psychosocial functioning, and that treatment gains were maintained over a 3-month follow-up period. The effect sizes for the main outcome measures were large to very large (d=0.90 to 1.47), and comparable to other Internet-based treatment programs as well as in-person tri**als** for SAD (e.g., Feske & Chambless, 1995; Tulbure, 2011). Participants also rated the treatment program as highly acceptable. This pilot study provides preliminary evidence that an Internet-based intervention grounded in ba**sic beha**vioral and acceptance-based principles is effective for the t**rea**tment of SAD, and that videoconferenced therapist support may be useful in enhancing treatment compliance. Implications and future directions are discussed.  2016 eid: 2-s2.0-84944097655
3. **Translating Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Anxious Youth to Rural-Community Settings via Tele-Psychiatry**
This study aimed to determine the feasibility of translating **cognit**ive **behavior**al therapy for anxious **youth** to rural-community settings via tele-psychiatry training. A 20-week group-supervision training program was delivered to ten different groups from different agencies within Northern Ontario. Each group consisted of four to nine clinicians with child therapy background not specific to **CBT** (n=78, 51% social workers, 49% other mental health disciplines). Clinicians were each required to treat an anxi**ous y**outh under supervision. Changes in clinician knowle**dge a**nd youth internalizing symptoms were measured. Northern Ontario clinicians showed significant gains on a ch**ild** CBT-related knowledge test (t<inf>(1, 52)</inf>=4.6, p<.001**). Al**though youth treated by these clinicians showed a significant decrease in anxiety symptoms, possible response bias and the lack of a comparison group mandate further studies before generalizing our findings. Nevertheless, training local therapists in anxiety-**foc**used CBT for children via a group supervision based tele-psychiatry model appears to be a feasible and well-received approach to knowledge translation to rural settings.  2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York. eid: 2-s2.0-84941258995
4. **Generic versus disorder specific cognitive behavior therapy for socialanxiety disorder in youth: A randomized controlled trial usinginternet delivery**
The study examined whether the efficacy of **cognit**ive **behavior**al treatment for Social Anxiety Disorder for children and **adolesc**ents is increased if intervention addresses speci**fic co**gnitive **and beha**vioral factors linked to the development and maintenance of **SAD** in young people, over and above the traditional generic **CBT** approach. Participants were 125 **youth**, aged 817 years, with a primary diagnosis** of** SAD, who were randomly assigned to gene**ric**** **CBT (CBT-GEN), social anxie**ty ****s**pecific C**BT **(CBT-SAD) or a wait list control (WLC). Intervention was delivered using a therapist-supported online program. After 12-weeks, participants who **rec**eive**d t**re**atm**ent (CBT-SAD or CBT-GEN) showed significantly greater reduction in social anxiety and post-event processing, and greater improvement in global functioning than the WLC but there was no sig**nif**icant** di**ffere**nce** between CBT-SAD and CBT-GEN on any outcome variable at 12-weeks or 6-month follow-up. Despite significant reductions in anxiety, the majority in both treatment conditions continued to meet diag**nos**tic criteria for SAD at 6-month follow-up. Decreases in social anxiety were associated with decreases in post-event processing. Future research should continue to investigate disorder-spe**cif**ic interventions for SAD in young people, drawing on evidence regarding causal or maintaining factors, in order to enhance treatment outcomes for this debilitating condition.  2016 Elsevier Ltd eid: 2-s2.0-85006141751
5. **Treatment of Social Anxiety Disorder Using Online Virtual Environments in Second Life**
Over 80% of people with social anxiety disorder (**SAD**) do not receive any type of treatment, despite the existence of effective evidence-based treatments. Barriers to treatment include lack of trained therapists (particularly in nonmetropolitan areas), logistical difficulties (e.g., cost, time, transportation), concerns regarding social stigma, and fear of negative evaluation from health care providers. Interventions conducted through electronic communication media, such as the Internet, have the potential to reach individuals who otherwise would not have access to evidence-based treatments. Second Life is an online virtual world that holds great promise in the widespread delivery of evidence-based treatments. We assessed the feasibility, acceptability, and initial efficacy of an acceptance-based **behavior** therapy in Second Life to treat adults with generali**zed** SAD. Participants (n= 14) received 12 sessions of weekly therapy and were assessed at pretreatment, midtreatment, posttreatment, and follow-up. Participants and therapists rated the treatment program as acceptable and feasible, despite frequently encountered technical difficulties. Analyses showed significant pretreatment to follow-up improvements in social anxiety symptoms, depression, disability, and quality of life, with effect sizes comparable to previously published results of studies delivering in-person **cognit****ive beha**vior ther**apy** for SAD. Implications and future directions are discussed.  2012. eid: 2-s2.0-84872289268
6. **Acceptance based behavior therapy for social anxiety disorder through videoconferencing**
Most individuals with social anxiety disorder (**SAD**) do not receive any type of treatment. Reasons include logistical barriers (e.g., geographic location, travel time), fear of stigmatization, and fear of the social interactions associated with seeking treatment. Videoconferencing technology holds great promise in the widespread delivery of evidence-based treatments to those who would otherwise not receive treatment. This pilot study assessed the feasibility, acceptability, and initial efficacy of an acceptance-based **behavior**al intervention using Skype videoconferencing to treat adults with generali**zed** SAD. Twenty-four participants received 12 sessions of weekly therapy and were assessed at pre-treatment, mid-treatment, post-treatment, and 3-month follow-up. Participants and therapists rated the intervention as acceptable and feasible. Analyses revealed significant pre-treatment to follow-up improvements in social anxiety, depression, disability, quality of life, and experiential avoidance, with effect sizes comparable to or larger than previously published results of studies delivering in-person **CB**T**** for SAD. Implications and future directions are discussed.  2013 Elsevier Ltd. eid: 2-s2.0-84879799248
7. **The SmartCAT: An m-health platform for ecological momentary intervention in child anxiety treatment**
Introduction: **Cognit**ive **behavior**al therapy (**CBT**) for child anxiety, although **efficaci**ous, typically requires 16-20 weekly sessions with a therapist. Br**ief**** C**BT (BCBT; eight sessions) for child anxiety is promising but may have less favorable outcomes owing to reduced session time. Mobile health (m-health) has the potential **to **improve BCBT efficacy by delivering ecological momentary intervention to engage **youth** in learning** an**d practicing CBT skills in their everyday lives (in vivo). Materials and Methods: We developed an m-health platform entitled SmartCAT (Smartphone-enhanced Child Anxiety Treatment). SmartCAT consists of (1) a smartphone application (app) that cu**e**s **y**outh to use the CBT skills taught in sessions, (2) an online portal that allows therapists to monitor skill use, to send cues and treatment-related materials, to** enga**ge youth in real-time via secure messages, and to manage rewards, and (3) a communication protocol that allows real-time bidirectional exchange between the app and the portal. A pilot stud**y wit**h nine youth (9-14 years old) examined the platform's feasib**ili**ty as an adjunct to BCBT. Results: SmartCAT was found t**o b**e capable of supporting BCBT for child anxiety and received positive feedback from both** ther**apists and youth patients. Patients rated the app as highly usable (mean=1.7 on a 1-7 scale, with 1="easy"). Patients completed 5.36 skills coach entries per session (standard deviation=1.95) and took an average of 3.14 min (standard deviation=0.98 min) to complete the entries. Conclusions: A sm**art**phone app is feasible within CBT for child anxiety. Users found SmartCAT both acceptable and easy to use. Integ**rat**ing an m-health platform within BCBT for anxious children may facilitate involvement in treatment and dissemination of effective procedures.

0. **A pilot randomized controlled trial of videoconference-assisted treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder**
Evidence-based **exposur**e and response **prevent**ion (**ERP**) treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder (**OCD**) is not always easily accessible. Long distances from specialist treatment and other practical or motivational difficulties can interfere w**ith** ERP access and outcome. Deli**ver**y of ERP through telepsychology can help "fill the gap". The current study included 30 patients w**ith** OCD who were randomized to 12 weeks of either videoconferen**ce-**assisted ERP (VCT; N**=10**), self-help ERP (S-H, N=10), or a wait-list condition (W-L, N=10). The VCT format included use of tablet-based videoconferencing sessions (N=6) or studio-based videoconference (N=4), as well as telephone calls. Patients rated the VCT format as natural and reported strong working alliances with their therapists. VCT treatment produced significantly greater reductions in obsessive-compulsive symptoms compared to the two control conditions. Treatment outcomes were similar to that of r**egu**lar face-to-face ERP and improvements in symptom scores remained stable at follow-up. T**he **study indicated that **ERP** for OCD can be delivered efficiently with videoconferencing technology along with telephone calls. The use of such technology in psychological treatment is likely to become more common in the future and it holds promise as a method to make evidence-based treatment more accessible.  2014 Elsevier Ltd. eid: 2-s2.0-84909588326
1. **An open trial of videoconference-mediated exposure and ritual prevention for obsessive-compulsive disorder**
The gold-standard treatment for **OCD** is **exposur**e and ritual **prevent**ion (**ERP**), yet despite its well-established efficacy, only a small percentage** of** OCD patients have access to this treatment. Remote treatments (e.g., videoconferencing) are becoming increasingly popular avenues for treatment delivery and show promise in increasing patient access to evidence-based mental health care. The current pilot study utilized an open trial to examine the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of videoconference-mediated, twice week**ly,** ERP for adults (n= 1**5) **with OCD. Results reveal**ed **that ERP was associated with significant impr**ove**ments in OCD symptoms and large within-group effect sizes. Among the 10 individuals who completed a 3-month follow-up assessment, 30% of participants no longer met DSM-IV-**TR **criteria for OCD and 80% of participants were rated as very much or much improved on the CGI. This study adds to the growing body of literature suggesting that videoconference-based interventions are viable alternatives to face-to-face treatment.  2014 Elsevier Ltd. eid: 2-s2.0-84901432153
2. **Telemental health: A status update**
A rather large body of literature now exists on the use of **telemental health** services in the diagnosis and management of various psychiatric conditions. This review aims to provide an up-to-date assessment** of telemental he**alth, focusing on four main areas: computerized CBT (cCBT), Internet-based CBT (iCBT), virtual reality **exposur**e therapy (VRET), and mobile therapy (mTherapy). Four scientific databases were searched and, where possible, larger, better-designed meta-analyses and controlled trials were highlighted. Taken together, published studies support an expanded role for telepsychiatry tools, with advantages that include increased care access, enhanced efficiency, reduced stigma associated with visiting mental health clinics, and the ability to bypass diagnosis-specific obstacles to treatment, such as when social anxiety **prevent**s a patient from leaving the house. Of technology-mediated therapies, cCBT and iCBT possess the most efficacy evidence, with VRET and mTherapy representing promising but less researched options that have grown in parallel with virtual reality and mobile technology advances. Nonetheless, telepsychiatry remains challenging because of the need for specific computer skills, the difficulty in providing patients with a deep understanding or support, concerns about the "therapeutic alliance", privacy fears, and the well documented problem of patient attrition. Future studies should further test the efficacy, advantages and limitations of technology-enabled CBT, as well as explore the online delivery of other psychotherapeutic and psychopharmacological modalities.  2015 World Psychiatric Association. eid: 2-s2.0-84930432208

0. **AiRCare: A Naturalistic Evaluation of the Effectiveness of a Protracted Telephone-Based Recovery Assistance Program on Continuing Care Outcomes**
Background & Objective Substance use disorder treatments are increasingly being contextualized within a disease management framework. Within this context, there is an identified need to maintain patients in treatment for longer periods of time in order to help them learn how to manage their disease. One way to meet this need is through **telephon**e-based interventions that engage patients, and include more active outreach attempts and involvement of the patient's family. This study sought to evaluate the effectiveness of three formats of an intensive 12-month post-discha**rge tele**phone-based case management approach (AiRCare) on **adher**ence to continuing care plans and substance use outcomes. Methods Data were abstracted from electronic medical records for 379 patients (59.9% male) discharged from a residential treatment program located in the southwestern U.S. from 2013 to 2015. Patients were categorized into one of three groups and r**eceived **telephone contacts based on their self-selection upon admission to residential treatment (i.e., patient only, family only, and both patient and family). Outcome variables included re-engagement and re-admission rates, quality of life, abstinence rates at 6 and 12 months, and compliance with continuing care plans. Results & Conclusions Favorable short- and long-term outcomes were found for the majority of patients, irrespective of case management group. There appeared to be some value in the addition of family contacts to patient contacts with respect to reducing risk for 12-month re-admission to residential care. These positive but preliminary indications of the effectiveness of AiRCare require replication in a well-powered, randomized controlled trial.  2016 Elsevier Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-84993969530
1. **The effects of psychoeducation and telepsychiatric follow-up on social functioning and medication adherence in the patients with schizophrenia [izofreni hastalari{dotless}na verilen ruhsal eitim ve telepsikiyatrik izlemenin hasta ilevsellii ve ila uyumuna etkisi]**
Objective: This randomized-controlled **experi**mental study was conducted to determine the effects of **psychoeduc**ation in the clinic and **regular** **telepsychiatr**ic follow-up (via **telephon**e) after discharge on social functioning, drug **adher**ence of patients with schziophrenia. Methods: This study was performed on totally 62 patients, assigned** to ex**periment (n=32) and control (n=30) groups, from 1st July 2010 to 31st May 2011, being followed in Mental Health Center of Kayseri Training and Research Hospital and meeting research criteria. Patients' characteristics were recorded by a form. For the pati**ents i**n experiment and control groups; before education, after education and after 6-mon**ths tele**phone follow-up Scales of Medicat**ion A**dherence Rating, Social Functioning were applied. In **the psycho**education process, the pati**ents i**n the experiment group were given 'Manual of Information for Patients with Schziophrenia' prepared by the researcher. After discharge, patients were intervi**ewed by **telephone for 6 months, every w**eek reg**ularly in average for 15 minutes. A standard, semi-structured interview form consisting of 7 questions we**re used **for telephone follow-up. Results: For the **patien**ts in the experiment group, after physc**hoeducat**ion and telephone follow-up, the mean sco**res f**or adherence to treatment and social functioning scores were increased, the differences between before and after **educatio**n and after telephone follow-up were significant. Again, the differences between the mea**n sco**res of adherence to treatment and social functioning were significant af**ter educ**ation and after telephone follow-up for t**he pat**ients in both experiment and control groups. In addition, the group and time interaction of the **mean **scores for adherence to treatment and social functioning were significant. Conclusion: According to these resul**ts, the ps**ychoeducation and te**lepsychi**atric follow-up via telephone i**nduce**d increases in adherence to treatment and social functioning for the patients. Supporting the patients with **schizoph**renia** vi**a psychoeducation **and telepsych**iatric follow-up had positive impact on these patients and these techniques are recommended to be used in patient follow-up at home. eid: 2-s2.0-84885139707
2. **Tecla: A telephone- and text-message based telemedical concept for patients with severe mental health disorders - study protocol for a controlled, randomized, study**
Background: Severe mental disorders like psychotic disorders including **schizophrenia** and schizoaffective disorders have a 12-month-prevalence of 2.6, bipolar disorders of 1.5 % in Germany. The relapse risk is high; so many patients need intensive monitoring and lifelong treatment. A high medication **adher**ence is essential for a successful treatment. But in practice, medicat**ion a**dherence is low and decreases over time. Telemedical care concepts might improve treatment and bridge gaps between in- and outpatient treatment. A telemedical care concept based on **regular** **telephon**e calls and short text messages was developed. The primary objective is to assess whether regu**lar tele**phone calls and text messages can improve the med**icati**on adherence of patients. Secondary objectives are the reduction of rehospitalization rates, the improvement of quality of life and of the severity of symptoms. Methods/design: The Tecla study (Post stationary telemedical care of patients with severe psychiatric disorders) is a two-armed prospective randomized controlled trial. The participants in the intervention group receive in addition to usual car**e **reg**ular **telephone calls every 2 weeks and weekly text messages on patient-individual topics during a 6 months period. Patients in the control group recei**ve only** regular care. Inclusion criteria are a physician-diagnosed bipolar disorder, schizoaffective disorder** or schizophr**enia and a signed informed consent. Exclusion criteria are planned inpatient treatments within the next 6 months and being non-reachable by phone. After 3 and 6 months both groups receive **follow up** assessments. Discussion: The primary objective of this study is the** medi**cation adherence that is measured with** the **Medication Adherence Report Scale, German version (MARS-D). The MARS-D is a self-repo**rt wi**th five items. Adherent behaviour is mostly overestimated using self-reports. The strength of the **MARS-**D is to detect non-adherent behavio**ur. T**he original Medication Adherence Report Scale in English language (MARS-5) was developed to encourage the patient to answer truthfully to the questions that are asked in a non-threatening and non-judgmental way to minimize social des**irabi**lity bias in admitting non-adherent behaviour.  2015 Stentzel et al. eid: 2-s2.0-84946030711

Methods: This study was performed on 62 caregivers of the schizophrenic patients, assigned** to ex**periment (n=32) and control (n=30) groups, from 1st July 2010 to 31st May 2011. The Scales for Expressed Emotion, the Beck Depression and the Zarit Family Burden were applied for the caregi**vers i**n experiment and control groups before education, after education and after 6-mon**ths tele**phone follow-up. Results: The mean scores of the ca**regive**rs in experiment group on family burden, emotional expression and depression were decreased after education an**d after **telephone follow-up and difference was significant (p &lt; 0.001). Conclusio**ns: Psycho**education **and telepsych**iatric fo**llow-up **via telephone induced decrease in family burden, emotional expression and depressive symptoms for their caregivers and was a support for the family in the patient care. eid: 2-s2.0-84881589469

1. **An internet-based cognitive-behavioral preventive intervention for complicated grief: A pilot study**
Bereaved parents and individuals bereaved by the sudden, unexpected, or violent death of a loved one are at **high risk** for developing complicated grief. However, **prevent**ive interventions for this at-risk population remain scarce. In the present pilot study, an Internet-based intervention for individuals bereaved in the previous 14 months was tested using a pretest/posttest design. A total of 35 bereaved individuals participated in a 3-week manuali**zed pre**vention program. Counselor and participants communicated exclusively via email. The intervention consisted of the following modules: (1) describing the circumstances of the death, (2) using the life-imprint method to explore the biography and life imprint of the deceased, (3) keeping a daily diary of social activities and sleep hygiene, (4) cognitive restructuring of dysfunctional thoughts, such as responsibility for the death and feelings of guilt, (5) communication within the family, (6) gender-specific coping with bereavement, and (7) bond with the deceased. Completer and intent-to-treat analyses suggest that the intervention led to a significant reduction in symptoms of complicated grief and **depress**ion at posttreatment.

2. **Adolescent and parent experiences with a primary care/Internet-based depression prevention intervention (CATCH-IT)**
This article describes a mixed-methods **approach** to understand the experience of adolescents involved in the Internet-based intervention for **depress**ion, Competent Adulthood Transition with Cognitive **Behavior**al Humanistic and Interpersonal Training (CATCH-IT), as well as the experiences of their parents while they were involved. Qualitative analysis was done with grounded theory-based categorization of interview comments and typed program responses (adolescents only) into themes. Quantitative analysis was done with self-report surveys. The article describes the nine themes reflecting the adolescent experience and the three themes reflecting the parent experience. The article also describes the results of the quantitative surveys of **help**fulness and attitudes change, which were favorable of the Internet-based intervention. Separate models explaining the psychological transformation of the adolescents and the experience of the parents are proposed. The positive experience of the adolescents and parents involved in CATCH-IT is discussed in the context of growing interest in how best to utilize Internet-based interventions for mental illness, and suggestions are made for future investigation.  2011 Elsevier Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-82855175151
3. **Internet-Based Interventions for the Prevention and Treatment of Mental Disorders in Latin America: A Scoping Review**
Background: There is a huge gap in the treatment of mental disorders in Latin America, especially among socioeconomically disadvantaged groups. Given the sharp increase in Internet access and the rapid penetration of smartphones in the region, the use of Internet-based technologies might potentially contribute to overcoming this gap and to provide more widely distributed and low-cost **mental health car**e in a variety of contexts. Methods: We conducted a scoping review of the literature in order to systematically map the existing evidence on use of Internet-based interventions for **prevent**ion, treatment, and management of mental disorders across Latin American countries, as well as to identify existing gaps in knowledge. Six electronic databases were searched for published papers (PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, SciELO, and CENTRAL). Results: After the eligibility assessment, we identified 22 Internet-based studies carried out in Latin America **for pre**vention, treatment, education, or facilitating self-management of mental disorders. Included studies mainly targeted **depress**ion (n = 11), substance misuse (n = 6), anxiety (n = 3), and mental health literacy for education and health professionals (n = 2). Most studies were undertaken in Brazil (n = 6), Mexico (n = 5), and Chile (n = 4). Only 3 studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs), 4 were pilot RCTs, and 15 were naturalistic, acceptability, or feasibility studies. The three RCTs identified showed disparate results, but overall, there are challenges to face. Better results are seen in the short-term (postintervention or after 3 months), but most studies do not explore outcomes for long enough (follow-up after 6 or 12 months). Most of the feasibility and pilot studies showed reasonably good acceptability for a wide range of strategies but difficulties to engage and retain participants for long enough or adhering to established protocols. Conclusion: This study shows that Internet-based interventions **for the** prevention and treatment of mental disorders are growing rapidly in Latin America, but there are few studies on effectiveness and cost effectiveness, making it difficult to provide the evidence needed to justify scaling up these interventions.

0. **A Promising New Strategy to Improve Treatment Outcomes for Patients with Depression**
Each year, ineffective medical management of patients with mental illness compromises the health and well-being of individuals, and also impacts communities and our society. A variety of interrelated factors have impeded the health system's ability to treat patients with behavior health conditions adequately. A key contributing factor is a lack of objective markers to help predict patient response to specific drugs that has led to patterns of "trial and error" prescribing. For many years, clinicians have sought objective data (eg, a laboratory or imaging test) to assist them in selecting appropriate treatments for individual patients. Electroencephalogram (EEG) findings coupled with medication outcomes data may provide a solution. "Crowdsourced" physician registries that reference clinical outcomes to individual patient physiology have been used successfully for cancers. These techniques are now being explored in the context of behavioral health care. The Psychiatric EEG Evaluation Registry (PEER) is one such approach. PEER is a clinical phenotypic database comprising more than 11,000 baseline EEGs and more than 39,000 outcomes of medication treatment for a variety of mental health diagnoses. Collective findings from 45 studies (3130 patients) provide compelling evidence for PEER as a relatively simple, inexpensive predictor of likely patient response to specific anti**depress**ants and likely treatment-related side effects (including suicidal ideation).

1. **Predicting post treatment client satisfaction between behavioural activation for depression delivered either in-person or via home-based telehealth**
Introduction: Treatment engagement, adherence, cancellations and other patient-centric data are important predictors of **treatment outcom**e. But often these data are only examined retrospectively. In this investigation, we analysed data from a clinical trial focused on innovative delivery of **depress**ion treatment to identify which patients are likely to prefer either in-home or in-person treatment based on pre-treatment characteristics. Methods: Patient satisfaction was assessed in a trial of individuals w**ith dep**ression treated using identical behavioural activation therapy protocols in person or through videoconferencing to the home (N = 87 at post treatment: 42 in-person and 45 in-home participants). The Client Satisfaction Questionnaire was administered at the end of the treatment. A Tobit regression model was used to assess moderation using treatment assignment. Regression lines were generated to model treatment satisfaction as a function of treatment assignment and to identify whether and where the groups intersected. We examined the distributions of the contributing moderators to the subsets of participants above and below the intersection point to identify differences. Results: While no significant differences in patient satisfaction were observed between the two groups, or between patients receiving treatment by different providers, baseline characteristics of the **sampl**e could be used to differentiate those with a preference for traditional, in-office care from those preferring in-home care. Discussion: Participants who were more likely to prefer in-home care were characterized by larger proportions of veterans and lower-ranked enlisted service members. They also had more severe symptoms at baseline and less formal education. Understanding client reactions when selecting treatment modality may allow for a more satisfying patient experience.

2. **Enthusiasm for homework and improvement of psychological distress in subthreshold depression during behavior therapy: Secondary analysis of data from a randomized controlled trial**
Background: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) usually involves homework, the completion of which is a known predictor of a positive outcome. The aim of the present study was to examine the session-by-session relationships between enthusiasm to complete the homework and the improvement of psychological distress in **depress**ed people through the course of therapy. Methods: Working people with subthresh**old dep**ression were recruited to participate in the telephone CBT (tCBT) program with demonstrated effectiveness. Their enthusiasm for homework was enhanced with motivational interviewing techniques and was measured by asking two questions: "How strongly do you feel you want to do this homework?" and "How confident do you feel you can actually accomplish this homework?" at the end of each session. The outcome was the K6 score, which was administered at the start of each session. The K6 is an index of psychological distress in**cluding** depression and anxiety. We used structural equation modeling (SEM) to elucidate the relationships between enthusiasm and the K6 scores from session to session. Results: The best fitting model suggested that, throughout the course of behavior therapy (BT), enthusiasm to complete the homework was negatively correlated with the K6 scores for the subsequent session, while the K6 score measured at the beginning of the session did not influence the enthusiasm to complete the homeworks assigned for that session. Conclusions: Empirical data now support the practitioners of BT when they try to enhance their patient's enthusiasm for homework regardless of the participant's distress, which then would lead to a reduction in distress in the subsequent week.  2015 Hayasaka et al. eid: 2-s2.0-84947976375
3. **Exploring the relationship between the acceptability of an internet-based intervention for depression in primary care and clinical outcomes: Secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial**
Background: **Depress**ion is one of the most prevalent psychological disorders worldwide. Although psychotherapy **for dep**ression is effective, there are barriers to its implementation in primary care in Spain. The use of the Internet has been shown to be a feasible solution. However, the acceptability of Internet-based interventions has not been studied sufficiently. Objective: To assess the acceptability of an Internet-based intervention (I**BI) for** depression in primary care, and explore the relationship between expectations and satisfaction and the improvement in the clinical variables in primary care patients receiving this intervention. Furthermore, it offers data about the effects of some sociodemographic characteristics on these acceptability variables and analyzes whether the expectations are related to finalizing the intervention. Methods: Data we**re base**d on depressive patients who were participants in a randomized controlled trial. In the present study, we present the data from all the participants in the Internet intervention groups (N = 198). All the participants filled out the expectation and satisfaction scales (six-item scales regarding treatment logic, satisfaction, recommending, usefulness for other disorders, usefulness for the patient, and unpleasant**ness), **the Beck Depression Inventory-II, and the secondar**y outco**me measures: depression and anxiety impairment, and positive and negative affect. Results: Results showed that participants' expectations and satisfaction with the program were both high and differences in expectations and satisfaction depended on some sociodemographic variables (age: older people have higher expectations; sex: women have greater satisfaction). A positive relationship between these variables and intervention efficacy was found: expectations related to usefulness for the patient were a statistically related predictor to the results on the BDI-II (Beta = 0.364), and the perception of how logical the treatment is (Beta = 0.528) was associated with change in the clinical variable. Furthermore, the higher the expectations, the higher the improvements exhibited by the patients in all measures evaluated during the ten intervention modules. High expectations were also directly related to finalizing the intervention. Conclusions: This is the first study in Spain to address this issue i**n the f**ield of IBIs for depression in primary care. The IBI showed high acceptance related to the intervention's efficacy and completion. Research on IBI acceptability could help to implement the treatment offered.

4. **Telephone-based cognitive behavioural therapy for female patients 1-year post-bariatric surgery: A pilot study**
Objective: Although bariatric surgery is a durable treatment for patients with severe obesity, it does not directly address behavioural and psychological factors that potentially contribute to weight regain post-surgery. Psychological interventions, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), can be challenging to access due to physical limitations and practical barriers. Telephone-based CBT (Tele-CBT) can improve eating psychopathology and psychological distress before and after surgery. Given the frequent occurrence/recurrence of problematic eating-related and psychological issues many patients face 1-year post-surgery, this open-trial pilot study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of Tele-CBT delivered 1-year post-surgery as an adjunctive treatment to the usual standard of bariatric care. Methods: Patients (n = 43) received six 1-h Tele-CBT sessions delivered weekly beginning at 1-year post-surgery. Patients completed questionnaire packages before and after the intervention to assess changes in binge eating (BES), emotional eating (EES), **depress**ion (PHQ-9), and anxiety (GAD-7). Results: Thirty-two patients completed Tele-CBT yielding a 74.4% completion rate. Participants reported significant improvements on the Binge Eating Scale (t(31) = 3.794, p = 0.001), Emotional Eating Scale (t(31) = 3.508, p = 0.001), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 Item Scale (z = 2.371, p = 0.018), and Generalised **Anxiety Disord**er-7 Item Scale (z = 3.546, p < 0.001) immediately following Tele-CBT. Discussion: The results demonstrate that Tele-CBT delivered 1-year post-surgery may improve binge eating, emotional eati**ng, dep**ression, and anxiety. Additional research is warranted to examine whether these changes translate into long-term improvements in bariatric surgery outcomes.  2019 Asia Oceania Association for the Study of Obesity eid: 2-s2.0-85070292051
5. **Core belief content examined in a large sample of patients using online cognitive behaviour therapy**
Abstract Background Computerised cognitive behavioural therapy provides a unique opportunity to collect and analyse data regarding the idiosyncratic content of people's core beliefs about the self, others and the world. Methods 'Beating the Blues' users recorded a core belief derived through the downward arrow technique. Core beliefs from 1813 mental health patients were coded into 10 categories. Results The most common were global self-evaluation, attachment, and competence. Women were more likely, and men were less likely (than chance), to provide an attachment-related core belief; and men were more likely, and women less likely, to provide a self-competence-related core belief. This may be linked to gender differences in sources of self-esteem. Those who were suffering from anxiety were more likely to provide power- and control-themed core beliefs and less likely to provide attachment core beliefs than chance. Finally, those who had thoughts of suicide in the preceding week reported less competence themed core beliefs and more global self-evaluation (e.g., 'I am useless') core beliefs than chance. Limitations Concurrent symptom level was not available. The **sampl**e was not nationally representative, and featured programme completers only. Conclusions Men and women may focus on different core beliefs in the context of CBT. Those suffering anxiety may need a therapeutic focus on power and control. A complete rejection of the self (not just within one domain, such as competence) may be linked to thoughts of suicide. Future research should examine how individual differences and symptom severity influence core beliefs.  2015 The Authors. eid: 2-s2.0-84938815259
6. **Pregnancy and the Acceptability of Computer-Based Versus Traditional Mental Health Treatments**
Background: Recent recommendations urge increased **depress**ion screening in pregnant and postpartum women, potentially increasing demand for treatment. Computer-based psychotherapy treatments may address some of perinatal women's unique mental health treatment needs and barriers. Materials and Methods: We conducted a quantitative survey of pregnant women (12 weeks of gestation) on preferences regarding computer-based therapies compared with traditional therapies (psychotherapy and medication). Nonpregnant women and men served as comparison groups. Participants were provided descriptions of three computer-based therapies: Video telehealth therapy (VTT), computer-assisted therapy (CAT), and self-guided online therapy (SGO). Participants were asked to select all options that they would consider for treatment as well as first choice preference. The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) assessed curr**ent dep**ressive symptomatology, and the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) assessed psychiatric history. Results: Participants included pregnant females (n = 111), nonpregnant females (n = 147), and males (n = 54). Among pregnant women, 77.5% (n = 86) indicated that they would consider some form of computer-based therapy for mental health treatment during pregnancy; VTT was the most commonly considered, followed by CAT and SGO. When asked to select their preferred intervention, traditional talk therapy was the first choice among all three groups, controlling for treatment history and PHQ-9 score. About one-third of pregnant women chose some form of computer-based therapy as their top choice. Conclusions: While computer-based therapies were acceptable to most pregnant women in this **sampl**e, traditional talk therapy was the preferred option. Future research should consider how to tailor computer-based therapies to the unique needs of perinatal women.  2017, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-85031664085
7. **A positive psychology intervention for patients with bipolar depression: a randomized pilot trial**
Background: There are few effective treatments for bipolar **depress**ion, a common and debilitating illness. Aims: We aimed to examine the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a four-week, telephone-delivered positive psychology (PP) intervention for patients with bipo**lar dep**ression. Methods: Twenty-five patients hospitalized for **bipolar** depression were randomized to receive a PP (n = 14) or control condition (CC; n = 11) intervention. Following discharge, participants completed weekly exercises and phone calls with a study trainer. PP intervention feasibility was assessed by the number of exercises completed, and acceptability was examined on five-point Likert-type scales of ease and utility. Between-group differences on psychological constructs at 4 and 8weeks post-enrollment were assessed using mixed effects regression models. Results: Participants in the PP group completed an average of three out of four PP exercises and found PP exercises to be subjectively helpful, though neither easy nor difficult. Compared to CC, the PP intervention led to trends towards greater improvements in positive affect and optimism at follow-up, with large effect sizes (modified Cohens d = 0.951.24). PP had variable, non-significant effects on negative psychological constructs. Conclusions: Larger, randomized trials are needed to further evaluate the efficacy of this intervention in this high-risk population.  2018,  2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group. eid: 2-s2.0-85048582203
8. **Common Factors and Depressive Symptom Relief Trajectories in Group Teletherapy for Persons Ageing with HIV**
Telepsychology research has focused primarily on treatment efficacy, with far less attention devoted to how common factors relate to teletherapy outcomes. This research identified trajectories of **depress**ive symptom relief in 105 older people living with HIV with eleva**ted dep**ressive symptoms enrolled in a randomized clinical trial testing two 12-session group teletherapies and compared common factors (e.g., therapeutic alliance and group cohesion)** across** depressive symptom trajectory groups. Growth mixture modellin**g of we**ekly depression scores i**dentifi**ed three depressive symptom change groups: (1) early improvers (31%) who rep**orted r**eductions in depressive symptoms by Session 4; (2) delayed improvers (16%) whose symptoms improved after Session 5 and (3) non-improvers (53%). Therapeutic alliance was unrelated to **treatment outcom**e group. Group cohesion was greater in early improvers than non-improvers. Group cohesion was unexpectedly lower, and group member similarity was greater in delayed improvers than non-improvers. Early improvers had been living with HIV/AIDS for fewer years than non-improvers. In group teletherapy, group cohesion and group member similarity are more important than clienttherapist alliance. Copyright  2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Key Practitioner Message: In group teletherapy with older people living with HIV (OPLWHIV), three latent outcome trajectory groups emerged over the 12-week treatment period: (1) non-improvers (53%); (2) early improvers (31%) and (3) delayed improvers (16%). In group teletherapy with OPLWHIV, group cohesion is **a stron**ger predictor of depressive symptom relief than is clienttherapist alliance. OPLWHIV in group teletherapy who do not respond to treatment until the latter therapy se**ssions **can still experience depressive symptom relief comparable with early responders.

9. **Effect of psychotherapy for depression via home telehealth on glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes: Subgroup analysis of a randomized clinical trial**
Objective: We evaluated the impact of telemedicine-delivered behaviour activation treatment (BAT) on glycemic control in a subgroup of older adults with diabetes who participated in a randomized controlled trial for **depress**ion. Research design and methods: We randomized older adults with ma**jor dep**ression to same-room or telemedicine BAT. Each group received eight weekly sessions. For the subgroup **analysi**s, we identified individuals with type 2 diabetes and obtained hemoglobin A1c at baseline and 12 months follow-up. We used mixed-effects models (MEM) for repeated measu**res ana**lysis to compare the longitudinal mean A1c. We estimated model-derived mean A1c values and considered an adjusted model to account for baseline health status. Results: We included 90 individuals with type 2 diabetes of the original 241 in the s**ubgroup** analysis (43 in telemedicine and 47 in same room). Treatment groups were not significantly different at baseline for demogr**aphics,** depression, anxiety or A1c levels (telemedicine 6.9 vs. same room 7.3, p = 0.19). Baseline mean A1c for the telemedicine group remained at 6.9 (55 mmol/mol) at 12 months, whereas baseline mean A1c for the same-room group increased to 7.7 (61 mmol/mol). Longitudinal trajectories of model-derived mean A1c indicated a significant main effect of treatment group on mean A1c value at study end (difference = 0.82, 95% CI 1.41, 0.24). Adjusted analyses gave comparable results. Conclusions: Telemedicine-delivered BAT was superior to same room in achieving lower mean A1c values in participants with type 2 diabetes, suggesting BAT-delivered via telemedicine is a viable treatment option for adults with diabetes.

10. **A Scenario-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Mobile App to Reduce Dysfunctional Beliefs in Individuals with Depression: A Randomized Controlled Trial**
Introduction: While self-administered mobile app-based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has shown efficiency and effectiveness over the past decade, attempts to address automatic and negative beliefs have been lacking. The purpose of this study was to introduce and verify a mobile app that directly intervenes in dysfunctional thoughts. This app-based treatment includes recognizing automatic and negative thoughts of the protagonist of scenarios, writing advice directly to the main character, and sharing advice provided by other participants. Materials and Methods: Thirty-four participants diagnosed with Other Specified **Depress**ive Disorder were recruited and randomly allocated to a CBT-based mobile-app program, the Todac Todac (TT group), or a daily mood chart app program (control group). Participants were asked to use the software for 3 weeks. Assessments for autonomic thoughts and clinical symptoms were administered at baseline and at a follow-up evaluation. Results: After completing the 3-week program, Dysfunctional Attitude Scale (DAS) scores in TT group were lower than they were in the control group. In clinical measures, both TT group and control group showed reduced B**eck Dep**ression Inventory-II (BDI-II) scores and situation-dependent trait version of State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-X2) at follow-up. However, TT group showed significantly reduced STAI-X2 scores compared to control group. For all participants, changes in DAS scores were correlated with BDI-II and STAI-X2 scores. Conclusions: Our preliminary findings provide promising evidence that scenario-based CBT mobile apps can be used to deliver feasible and **efficaci**ous cognitive therapy. Long-term research is needed to determine the impact and effectiveness of this new treatment format.  Copyright 2018, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2018. eid: 2-s2.0-85053678284
11. **Telephone-administered psychotherapy in combination with antidepressant medication for the acute treatment of major depressive disorder**
Background Telephone-administered psychotherapies (T-P) provided as an adjunct to anti**depress**ant medication may improve response rates in ma**jor dep**ressive disorder (MDD). The goal of this study was to compare telephone-administered social rhythm therapy (T-SRT) and telephone-administered intensive clinical management (T-ICM) as adjuncts** to ant**idepressant medication for MDD. A secondary goal was to compare T-P with Treatment as Usual (TAU) as adjunctive treatment to medication for MDD. Methods 221 adult out-patients with MDD**, curre**ntly depressed, were randomly assigned to 8 sessions of weekly T-SRT (n=110) or T-ICM (n=111), administered as an adjunct to agomelatine. Both psychotherapies were administered entirely by telephone, by trained psychologists who were blind to other aspects of treatment. The 221 patients were a posteriori m**atched **with 221 depressed outpatients receiving TAU (controls). The primary outcome measure was the percentage of responders at 8 weeks post-treatment. Results No significant differences were found between T-SRT and T-ICM. But T-P was associated with higher response rates (65.4% vs 54.8%, p=0.02) and a trend toward higher remission rates (33.2% vs 25.1%; p=0.06) compared to TAU. Limitations Short term study. Conclusions This study is the first assessing the short-term effects of an add-on, brief, telephone-administer**ed psyc**hotherapy in depressed pa**tients **treated with antidepressant medication. Eight sessions of weekly telephone-delivered psychot**herapy **as an adjunct to antidepressant medication resulted in improved response rates relative to medication alone. eid: 2-s2.0-84944809872
12. **Trajectory of cost overtime after psychotherapy for depression in older Veterans via telemedicine**
Background Little evidence exists regarding the costs of telemedicine, especially considering changes over time. This **analysi**s aimed to analyze trajectory of healthcare cost before, during, and after a behavioral activation intervention delivered via telepsychology and same-room delivery to elderly Veterans with **depress**ion. Methods 241 participants were randomly assigned into one of two study groups: behavioral activation **for dep**ression via telemedicine or via same-room treatment. Patients received 8 weeks of weekly 60-min individual sessions of behavioral activat**ion for** depression. Primary outcomes were collected at 12-months. Inpatient, outpatient, pharmacy, and total costs were collected from VA Health Economics Resource Center (HERC) datasets for FY 19982014 and compared between the two treatment groups. Generalized mixed models were used to investigate the trajectories over time. Results Overall cost, as well as, outpatient and pharmacy cost show increasing trend over time. Unadjusted and adjusted trajectories over time for any cost were not different between the two treatment groups. There was a significant overall increasing trend over time for outpatient (p<0.001) and total cost (p<0.001) but not for inpatient (p=0.543) or pharmacy cost (p=0.084). Limitations Generalizability to younger, healthier populations may be limited due to inclusion criteria for study participants. Conclusion Healthcare costs before, during, and after intervention did not differ between the telemedicine and in-person delivery methods. Outpatient costs accounted for most of the increasing trend of cost over time. These results support policies to use both telehealth and in-person treatment modalities to effectively and efficiently provide high quality care.  2016 Elsevier B.V. eid: 2-s2.0-85007545283
13. **Telephone-based care management for older adults initiated on psychotropic medication**
Objective This study aimed to explore the longitudinal, 6-month symptom course of older adults newly started on an anti**depress**ant or anxiolytic by non-psychiatrist physicians and enrolled in a care management program. Method This is a naturalistic cohort study of older adults (age 65 years) receiving pharmacotherapy and telephone-based care management. Participants are non-institutionalized adults participating in Pennsylvania's Pharmaceutical Assistance Contract for the Elderly who completed telephone-based clinical assessments including demographic data, self-report on history of psychiatric treatment and adherence, and standardized symptom scales. Results A total of 162 participants with an average age of 77.2 years (SD 6.8) were followed and, for **analysi**s, split into two groups by PHQ-9 score: 75 (46.3%) scoring 0-4 (minimally symptomatic group, MSG) and 87 (53.7%) scoring 5 (symptomatic group, SG). Over 6 months, the SG improved with PHQ-9 scores beginning on average at 10.0 (SD 4.6) and falling to 5.4 (SD 4.2) (F(1, 86) = 29.53, p &lt; 0.0001). The MSG had no significant change** in dep**ressive symptoms. Emotional health as measured by SF-12 Mental Composite Score mirrored the PHQ-9 change and lack thereof in the SG and MSG, respectively. No clinical or demographic features were associated with symptom improvement in the SG although they were more likely to report medication adherence (66.7% vs. 44.0%, 2(1) = 8.4, p = 0.0037) compared with the MSG. Conclusions Participation of symptomatic older adults initiated on psychotropic medication in a telephone-based care management program was associated with improve**ment in** depressive symptoms and overall emotional well-being, notable findings given participants' advanced age, state-wide distribution, and history of limited utilization of mental health care.  2012 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. eid: 2-s2.0-84874702662
14. **Cost-effectiveness of a novel e-health depression service**
Objectives: A recent trial assessed feasibility of an e-health service ("Improvehealth.eu") to support **depress**ion care and reported positive outcomes. Our objective was to examine cost-effectiveness of the Improvehealth.eu service. A baseline model was used to evaluate cost and effects of the intervention. Given the high uncertainty in the input space, a series of alternative scenarios were evaluated to challenge the result. The aim was to find if conservative or even pessimistic estimates and assumptions could result in a change of the cost-effectiveness from the baseline model. Materials and Methods: A probabilis**tic dep**ression model combined with bootstrapping was built and populated with data from the literature and from the pilot efficacy trial of the e-health service. The core of the model was a stochastic mapping function that tra**nslated** depression-specific outcomes to quality-adjusted life years. Correlated **sampl**ing was used to obtain unbiased and consistent piecewise linear transformat**ion of **Beck Depression Inventory scores to utilities. The results are shown as cost-effectiveness acceptability curves with value of information data. An extreme scenario **analysi**s was then performed to deal with parameter, structural, and modeling uncertainty. Results: Cost-effectiveness of the e-health service was favorable because of low cost and high efficacy of the intervention. Apart from the most pessimistic one, none of the 13 alternative scenarios changed the preferred alternative. Conclusions: Improvehealth.eu is cost-effective relative to usual care, given the available efficacy data. Results of the health economic evaluation were robust to alternative assumptions, despite considerable uncertainty in input data.  Copyright 2013, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2013. eid: 2-s2.0-84891643082
15. **CTN-194 (PICCO): Design of a trial of citalopram for the prevention of depression and its consequences in HIV-Hepatitis C co-infected individuals initiating pegylated interferon/ribavirin therapy**
Hepatitis C (HCV)-related end stage liver disease is a primary cause of morbidity and mortality in people with HIV. Despite this, co-infected patients have low rates of HCV treatment initiation and completion. This is in large part due to the risk of pegylated-interferon alpha (PEG-IFN-)-related neuropsychiatric complications. We describe the design of a multicentre randomized, placebo-controlled trial that evaluates whether anti**depress**ant prophylaxis is superior to early detection and treatment** of dep**ression in increasing the successful completion of HCV therapy. Seventy-six HIV+ adults with chronic HCV infection requiring therapy and with no contraindications to PEG-IFN-/ribavirin will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive citalopram or placebo starting three weeks prior to HCV treatment. A novel aspect of the trial design is the built-in management of e**mergent** depression while maintaining the blinded treatment assignment. This will permit the comparison of prophylactic versus therapeutic use of citalopram. The primary outcome is the average proportion of prescribed PEG-IFN- and ribavirin doses taken per month at weeks 12 and 24, and will be compared between treatment arms. The study will also compare the development of moderat**e-to-se**vere depression between treatment arms. A unique feature of this trial will be the use of Telepsychiatry to standardize observer-administered neuropsychiatric evaluations. Assessments of anxiety, quality of life, and adherence to therapy, as well as pathogenetic studies of neuropsychiatric side effects, will be conducted. Intention-to-treat analyses using random regression modeling will be employed to analyze longitudinal data on prescribed PEG-IFN- and ribavirin doses. Survival analyses will be used to compare the time to the** develo**pment of depression between the two arms. Effective prevention of a broad range of neuropsychiatric symptoms by citalopram has the potential to diminish PEG-IFN- associated morbidity and consequently, allow a greater number of patients to complete full therapy.  2008 Elsevier Inc.

16. **Implementing multifactorial psychotherapy research in online virtual environments (IMPROVE-2): Study protocol for a phase III trial of the MOST randomized component selection method for internet cognitive-behavioural therapy for depression**
Background: **Depress**ion is a global health challenge. Although there are effective psychological and pharmaceutical interventions, our best treatments achieve remission rates less than 1/3 and limited sustained recovery. Underpinning this efficacy gap is limited understanding of how complex psychological interventions **for dep**ression work. Recent reviews have argued that the active ingredients of therapy need to be identified so that therapy can be made briefer, more potent, and to improve scalability. This in turn requires the use of rigorous study designs that test the presence or absence of individual therapeutic elements, rather than standard comparative randomised controlled trials. One such approach is the Multiphase Optimization Strategy, which uses efficient experimentation such as factorial designs to identify active factors in complex interventions. This approach has been successfully applied to behavioural health but not yet to mental health interventions. Methods/Design: A Phase III randomised, single-blind balanced fractional factorial trial, based in England and conducted on the internet, randomized at the level of the patient, will investigate the active ingredients of internet cognitive-behavioural therapy (C**BT) for** depression. **Adults **with depression (operationalized as PHQ-9 score  10), recruited directly from the internet and from an UK National Health Service Improving Access to Psychological Therapies service, will be randomized across seven experimental factors, each reflecting the presence versus absence of specific treatment components (activity scheduling, functional **analysi**s, thought challenging, relaxation, concreteness training, absorption, self-compassion training) using a 32-condition balanced fractional factorial design (2IV 7-2). The primary outcome** is sym**ptoms of depression (PHQ-9) at 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes include symptoms of anxiety and process measures related to hypothesized mechanisms. Discussion: Better understanding of the active ingredients of **efficaci**ous therapies, such as CBT, is necessary in order to improve and further disseminate these interventions. This study is the first application of a component selection experiment to psychologic**al inte**rventions in depression and will enable us to determine the main effect of each treatment component and its relative efficacy, and cast light on underlying mechanisms, so that we can systematically enhance internet CBT.

17. **Predictors of dropout in face-to-face and internet-based cognitive-behavioral therapy for bulimia nervosa in a randomized controlled trial**
Objective: We sought to identify predictors and moderators of failure to engage (i.e., pretreatment attrition) and dropout in both Internet-based and traditional face-to-face cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for bulimia nervosa. We also sought to determine if Internet-based treatment reduced failure to engage and dropout. Method: Participants (N=191, 98% female) were randomized to Internet-based CBT (CBT4BN) or traditional face-to-face group CBT (CBTF2F). Sociodemographics, clinical history, eating disorder severity, comorbid psychopathology, health status and quality of life, personality and temperament, and treatment-related factors were investigated as predictors. Results: Failure to engage was associated with lower perceived treatment credibility and expectancy (odds ratio [OR]=0.91, 95% CI: 0.82, 0.97) and body mass index (BMI) (OR=1.10; 95% CI: 1.03, 1.18). Dropout was predicted by not having a college degree (hazard ratio [HR]=0.55; 95% CI: 0.37, 0.81), novelty seeking (HR=1.02; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.03), previous CBT experience (HR=1.77; 95% CI: 1.16, 2.71), and randomization to the individual's nonpreferred treatment format (HR=1.95, 95% CI: 1.28, 2.96). Discussion: Those most at risk of failure to engage had a higher BMI and perceived treatment as less credible and less likely to succeed. Dropout was associated with less education, higher novelty seeking, previous CBT experience, and a mismatch between preferred and assigned treatment. Contrary to expectations, Internet-based CBT did not reduce failure to engage or dropout.  2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.(Int J Eat Disord 2017; 50:569577).  2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-85006054976
18. **Acceptance of home-based telehealth problem-solving therapy for depressed, low-income homebound older adults: Qualitative interviews with the participants and aging-service case managers**
Purpose: To report low-income homebound older adults' experience of telehealth problem-solving therapy (tele-PST) and aging-service case managers' (CMs') experience/perception of client-level personal barriers to accessing psychotherapy in general and PST specifically. Design and Methods: The study **sampl**e consisted of 42 homebound older adults who participated in the feasibility and efficacy trial of tele-PST and completed 36-week follow-up assessments and 12 CMs of a large home-delivered meals program who referred their clients to the tele-PST trial. In-depth interviews with the older adults and written feedback and focus group discussions with the CMs provided the data. Results: Older adults reported a high rate of approval of PST procedures and acknowledged its positive treatment effect. Tele-PST participants were satisfied with videoconferenced sessions because they were convenient and allowed them to see their therapist. However, CMs reported that only about 10%-20% of potentially eligible older adults gave oral consent for PST. Significant treatment engagement barriers were the older adults' lack of motivation, denial of **depress**ion, perceived stigma, and other personal attitudinal factors. Implications: The real-world implementation of tele-PST or other psychotherapies needs to include educating and motivat**ing dep**ressed homebound elders to recogniz**e their** depression and accept treatment.  2013 The Author. eid: 2-s2.0-84905013447
19. **The effect of telephone-based interpersonal psychotherapy for the treatment of postpartum depression: Study protocol for a randomized controlled trial**
Backgroun d: Substantial data indicate potential health consequences of untreated postpartum **depress**ion (PPD) on the mother, infant, and family. Studies have evaluated interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) as treatment for PPD; however, the results are questionable due to methodological limitations. A comprehensive review of maternal treatment preferences suggests that mothers favor 'talking therapy' as a form of PPD treatment. Unfortunately, IPT is not widely available, especially in rural and remote areas. To improve access to care, telepsychiatry has been introduced, including the provision of therapy via the telephone.Methods/Design: The purpose of this randomized controlled trial is to evaluate the effect of telephone-based IPT on the treatment of PPD. Stratification is based on self-reported history** of dep**ression and province. The target **sampl**e is 240 women. Currently, women from across Canada between 2 and 24 weeks postpartum are able to either self-iden**tify as** depressed and refer themselves to the trial or they may be referred by a health professional based on a score >12 on the Edinburg**h Postn**atal Depression Scale (EPDS). Following contact by the trial coordinator, a detailed study explanation is provided. Women who fulfill the eligibility criteria (including a positive diagnostic asses**sment f**or major depression) and consent to participate are randomized to either the control group (standard postpartum care) or intervention group (standard postpartum care plus 12 telephone-based IPT sessions within 12 to 16 weeks, provided by trained nurses). Blinded research nurses telephone participants at 12, 24, and 36 weeks post-randomization to assess for PPD and other** outcom**es including depressive symptomatology, anxiety, couple adjustment, attachment, and health service utilization. Results from this ongoing trial will: (1) develop the body of knowledge concerning the effect of telephone-based IPT as a treatment option for PPD; (2) advance our understanding of training nurses to deliver IPT; (3) provide an economic evaluation of an IPT intervention; (4) investigate the utility of the EPDS in general clinic**al prac**tice to identify depressed mothers; and (5) present valuable information regarding PPD, along with associated couple adjustment, co-morbid anxiety and self-reported attachment among a mixed rural and urban Canadian population.Trial registration: Current Controlled Trials Ltd.

20. **Pilot randomised controlled trial of Help4Mood, an embodied virtual agent-based system to support treatment of depression**
Introduction: Help4Mood is an interactive system with an embodied virtual agent (avatar) to assist in self-monitoring of patients receiving treatment for **depress**ion. Help4Mood supports self-report and biometric monitoring and includes elements of cognitive behavioural therapy. We aimed to evaluate system use and acceptability, to explore likely recruitment and retention rates in a clinical trial and to obtain an estimate of potential treatment response with a view to conducting a future randomised controlled trial (RCT). Methods: We conducted a pilot RCT of Help4Mood in three centres, in Romania, Spain and Scotland, UK. Patients with diagno**sed dep**ression** (major** depressive disorder) and current mi**ld/mode**rate depressive symptoms were randomised to use the system for four weeks in addition to treatment as usual (TAU) or to TAU alone. Results: Twenty-seven individuals were randomised and follow-up data were obtained from 21 participants (12/13 Help4Mood, 9/14 TAU). Half of participants randomised to Help4Mood used it regularly (more than 10 times); none used it every day. Acceptability varied between users. Some valued the emotional responsiveness of the system, while others found it too repetitive. Intention to treat **analysi**s showed a small difference in** change** of Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-2) scores (Help4Mood 5.7 points, TAU 4.2). Post-hoc on-treatm**ent ana**lysis suggested that participants who used Help4Mood regularly experienced a median change in BDI-2 of 8 points. Conclusion: Help4Mood is acceptable to some patients rece**iving t**reatment for depression although none used it as regularly **as inte**nded. Changes in depression symptoms in individuals who used the system regularly reached potentially meaningful levels.  2015,  The Author(s) 2015. eid: 2-s2.0-84983070104
21. **Comorbid Anxiety Disorders and Treatment of Depression in People With Multiple Sclerosis**
Objective: Anxiety is highly comorbid with **depress**ion, but little is known about the impact of **anxiety disord**ers on the effectiveness of empirically supported psychotherapies **for dep**ression. We examined such outcomes for people with Multiple Sclerosis (**MS) and** depression, with versus without comor**bid anxiety di**sorders. Design: Participants with MS (N = 102) received 16 weeks of telephone-administered psycho**therapy** for depression and were followed for one year post-treatment. Results: Participants with c**omorbid anxiet**y disorders improved to a similar degree during treatment as th**ose without an**xiety disorders. Outcomes during follow-up were mixed, and thus we divided the anxiety diagnoses into distress and fear disorders. The distress disorder (GAD) was associated with elevated anxiety symptoms during and after treatment. In contrast, fear disorders (i.e., panic disorder, agoraphobia, social phobia, specific phobia)** were l**inked to depression, specifically during follow-up, across 3 different measures.

Objective: The objective of this study was to test the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary clinical outcomes of a method to leverage existing home healthcare telemonitoring technology to deliver **depress**ion care management (DCM) to both Spanish- and English-speaking elderly homebound recipients of homecare services. Materials and Methods: Three stand-alone, nonprofit community homecare agencies located in New York, Vermont, and Miami participated in this study. Evidence-based DCM was adapted to the telemonitor platform by programming questions and educational information** on dep**ression sympto**ms, ant**idepressant adherence, and side effects. Recruited patients participated for a minimum of 3 weeks. Telehealth nurses were trained on DCM and received biweekly supervision. On-site trained research assistants conducted in-home research in**terview**s on depression diagnosis and severity and patient satisfaction with the protocol. Results: An ethnically diverse **sampl**e of 48 English- and Spanish-only-speaking patients participated, along with seven telehealth nurses. Both patients and telehealth nurses reported high levels of protocol acceptance. Among 19 patients meeting diagnostic cri**teria f**or major d**epressi**on, the mean depression severity was in the "markedly severe" range at baseline and in the "mild" range at follow-up. Conclusions: Results of this pilot support the feasibility of using homecare's existing telemonitoring technology to deliver DCM to their elderly homebound patients. This was true for both English- and Spanish-speaking patients. Preliminary clinical outcomes** sugges**t improvement in depression severity, although these findings require testing in a randomized clinical trial. Implications for the science and **service** of telehealth-based depression care for elderly patients are discussed.  Copyright 2011, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2011. eid: 2-s2.0-80053250021
23. **Automated depression screening in disadvantaged pregnant women in an urban obstetric clinic**
Objective: A promising means of screening for **depress**ion among high-risk perinatal women involves interactive voice response (IVR) technology in which patients self-enter data into a database using a touch tone telephone. Our aim was to test the feasibility of using IVR to screen **for dep**ression among low-income, urban pregnant patients and to solicit their preferences for treatment. Methods: The study population included a convenience **sampl**e of English-speaking pregnant patients awaiting routine prenatal visits in an urban obstetric clinic. Consenting subjects used a phone in a private clinic room to complete an IVR version of the Edinburgh Po**stnatal** Depression Scale (EPDS). Patients scoring **in the **"not depressed" range were branched to a closing message while those with** mild t**o severe depressive symptoms were branched to additional automated questions about their treatment preferences. Results: All 54 participants who consented to the study were able to complete the IVR phone session. More than 90% expressed willingness to complete IVR interviews as part of routine prenatal and postpartum care. Sixteen out of 54 participants (29.6%) scored in the moderate **to seve**re range for depressive symptoms (EPDS  12) which was consistent with a prior study in the same population using a validated paper-pencil screen. **Only 12** out of 21 (57%) depressed subjects indicated a desire to speak with a health care provider about how they are fee**ling. T**he majority of these depressed subjects preferred to speak with a social worker about housing or financial problems (92%) or an obstetrician or midwife (83%), while a minority (42%) wanted to speak with a mental health professional. Conclusions: This pilot study suggests that it is feasible to use an automate**d phone** interview to screen for depression in low-income, urban pregnant women.  2007 Springer-Verlag. eid: 2-s2.0-34547734529
24. **Comparing in-person to videoconference-based cognitive behavioral therapy for mood and anxiety disorders: Randomized controlled trial**
Background: Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) has demonstrated efficacy and effectiveness for treating mood and **anxiety disord**ers. Dissemination of CBT via videoconference may help improve access to treatment. Objective: The present study aimed to compare the effectiveness of CBT administered via videoconference to in-person therapy for a mixed diagnostic cohort. Methods: A total of 26 primarily Caucasian clients (mean age 30 years, SD 11) who had a primary Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition text revision (DSM-IV-TR) diagnosis of a mood** or anxiety di**sorder were randomly assigned to receive 12 sessions of CBT either in-person or via videoconference. Treatment involved individualized CBT formulations specific to the presenting diagnosis; all sessions were provided by the same therapist. Participants were recruited through a university clinic. Symptoms of **depress**ion, anxiety, stress, and quality of life were assessed using questionnaires before, after, and 6 weeks following treatment. Secondary outcomes at posttreatment included working alliance and client satisfaction. Results: Retention was similar across treatment conditions; there was one more client in the videoconferencing condition at posttreatment and at follow-up. Statistical **analysi**s using multilevel mixed effects linear regression indicated a significant reduction in client symptoms across time for symptoms** of dep**ression (P<.001, d=1.41), anxiety (P<.001, d=1.14), stress (P<.001, d=1.81), and quality of life (P<.001, d=1.17). There were no significant differences between treatment conditions regarding symp**toms of** depression (P=.165, d=0.37), anxiety (P=.41, d=0.22), stress (P=.15, d=0.38), or quality of life (P=.62, d=0.13). There were no significant differences in client rating of the working alliance (P=.53, one-tailed, d=-0.26), therapist ratings of the working alliance (P=.60, one-tailed, d=0.23), or client ratings of satisfaction (P=.77, one-tailed, d=-0.12). Fisher's Exact P was not significant regarding differences in reliable change from pre- to posttreatment or from pretreatment to follow-up for **symptom**s of depression (P=.41, P=.26), anxiety (P=.60, P=.99), or quality of life (P=.65, P=.99) but was significant for symptoms of stress in favor of the videoconferencing condition (P=.03, P=.035). Difference between conditions regarding clinically significant change was also not observed from pre- to posttreatment or from pretreatment to follow-up **for sym**ptoms of depression (P=.67, P=.30), anxiety (P=.99, P=.99), stress (P=.19, P=.13), or quality of life (P=.99, P=.62). Conclusions: The findings of this controlled trial indicate that CBT was effective in significantly r**educing** symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress and increasing quality of life in both in-person and videoconferencing conditions, with no significant differences being observed between the two. eid: 2-s2.0-84887863626
25. **A randomized controlled trial of telephone-delivered cognitive-behavioral therapy for late-life anxiety disorders**
OBJECTIVES: Older adults face a number of barriers to receiving psychotherapy, such as a lack of transportation and access to providers. One way to overcome such barriers is to provide treatment by telephone. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of cognitive behavioral therapy delivered by telephone (CBT-T) to older adults diagnosed with an **anxiety disord**er. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Participants' homes. PARTICIPANTS: Sixty participants age 60 and older with a diagnosis of generali**zed anxiety di**sorder, panic disor**der, or anxiet**y disorder not otherwise specified. INTERVENTION: CBT-T versus information-only comparison. MEASUREMENTS: Coprimary outcomes included worry (Penn State Worry Questionnaire) and general anxiety (State Trait Anxiety Inventory). Secondary outcomes included clinician-rated anxiety (Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale), anxiety sensitivity (Anxiety Sensitivity Index), **depress**ive symptoms (B**eck Dep**ression Inventory), quality of life (SF-36), and sleep (Insomnia Severity Index). Assessments were completed prior to randomization, immediately upon completion of treatment, and 6 months after completing treatment. RESULTS: CBT-T was superior to information-only in reducing general anxiety (ES = 0.71), worry (ES = 0.61), anxiety sensitivity (ES = 0.85), and insomnia (ES = 0.82) at the posttreatment assessment; however, only the reductions in worry were maintained by the 6-month follow-up assessment (ES = 0.80). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that CBT-T may be **efficaci**ous in reducing anxiety and worry in older adults, but additional sessions may be needed to maintain these effects.  2012 American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry. eid: 2-s2.0-84864241378
26. **Telemedicine for depression: A systematic review**
PURPOSE. More than 14% of the population has a mood disorder, and more than 50% do not receive treatment. Information and communication technology (ICT) could improve health care. A systematic review was considered in order to know the programs that apply ICT in the management of **depress**ion and to assess their effectiveness. CONCLUSION. There is insufficient scientific evidence regarding the effectiveness of ICT use in the management** of dep**ression. However, there is a well-founded hypothesis that videoconference produces the same results as face-to-face treatment and that self-help Internet programs could improve symptoms. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS. More research is needed; nevertheless, when traditional care is not possible, telemedicine could be used.  2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-77954357632
27. **Design and implementation of the Telemedicine-Enhanced Antidepressant Management Study**
Objective: Evidence-based practices designed for large urban clinics are not necessarily transportable into small rural practices. Implementing collaborative care for **depress**ion in small rural primary care clinics presents unique challenges because it is typically not feasible to employ on-site mental health specialists. The purpose of the Telemedicine-Enhanced **Antidep**ressant Management (TEAM) study was to evaluate a collaborative care model adapted for small rural clinics using telemedicine technologies. The purpose of this paper is to describe the TEAM study design. Method: The TEAM study was conducted in small rural Veterans Administration community-based outpatient clinics with interactive video equipment available for mental health, but no on-site psychiatrists/psychologists. The study attempted to enroll all patient**s whose** depression could be appropriately treated in primary care. Results: The clinical characteristics of the 395 study participants differed significantly from most previous trials of collaborative care. At baseline, 41% were already receiving p**rimary **care depression treatment. Study participants averaged 5.5 chronic physical health illnesses and 56.5% had a comorbid **anxiety disord**er. Over half (57.2%) reported that pain impaired their functioning extremely or quite a bit. Conclusions: Despite small patient populations in rural clinics, enoug**h patie**nts with depression can be successfully enrolled to evaluate telemedicine-based collaborative care.  2006 Elsevier Inc.

28. **Feasibility and acceptability of clinic-based telepsychiatry for low-income hispanic primary care patients**
Background: The feasibility and acceptability of telepsychiatry for low-income Hispanic patients with major **depress**ion were assessed. Subjects and Methods: In total, 167 adult Hispanic patients with ma**jor dep**ression recruited from a community health center (CHC) were randomly assigned to receive psychiatry services through a video Webcam (WEB) (n=80) or to treatment as usual (TAU) (n=87). The WEB condition consisted of monthly telepsychiatry sessions at the CHC for 6 months provided by one of two Hispanic psychiatrists using an online virtual meeting program. TAU patients received their care from their providers. Acceptability was assessed by comparing appointment keeping for primary care versus telepsychiatry, patients' perceived working alliance with their provider, visit satisfaction, **and ant**idepressant use. Feasibility was ass**essed u**sing depression outcomes, functional days (unproductive or days lost), and whether WEB and TAU patients differed in their appointment keeping. Results: WEB patients did not differ in the proportion of completed primary care versus telepsychiatry appointments and rated their working alliance with the psychiatrist and their visit satisfaction significantly higher than the TAU patients with their provider. Significantly more WEB than TAU pa**tients **used antide**pressan**ts. Although depression severity decreased faster among WEB than TAU patients, no differences we**re foun**d in the overall depression score. WEB and TAU patients did not differ in the number of days that were **lost or** unproductive due to depression. Although WEB and TAU patients reported being willing to pay for mental health services provided by the CHC, almost proportionately twice as many WEB patients were willing to pay for telepsychiatry. Conclusions: R**esults **show that for low-income depressed Hispanic p**atients**, telepsychiatry service for depression is acceptable, although its feasibility is questionable. The benefits of telemedicine were discussed in terms of improving patient care in ways other than directly providing services to the patients.

29. **Relationships Among Depressive Symptoms, Benefit-Finding, Optimism, and Positive Affect in Multiple Sclerosis Patients After Psychotherapy for Depression**
Objective: While many patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) experience psychological problems, such as **depress**ion, benefit-finding is commonly reported. Using the Broaden-and-Build Model of positive emotions (Fredrickson, 2001) and the Expectancy-Value Model of optimism (Carver & Scheier, 1998) as two related, yet, distinct conceptual frameworks, this study examined positive affect and optimism as mediators of the relationship between impro**ved dep**ression and enhanced benefit-finding. Design: MS patients (N = 127), who participated in a larger, randomized clinical trial comparing two types of telephone psychother**apy for** depression, were assessed at baseline, midtherapy (8 weeks), end of therapy (16 weeks), and 6- and 12-month posttherapy. Main Outcom**e Measu**res: Depression was measured with a telephone administered version of the Hamilton R**ating S**cale for Depression; Positive Affect was measured with the Positive Affect Subscale from the Positive and Negative Affect Scale; Optimism was measured with the Life Orientation Test-Revised; Benefit-Finding was measured with the revised version of the Stress-Related Growth Scale. Results: Data were analyzed with multilevel random-effects models, controlling for time since MS diagnosis and type of **treatme**nt. Improved depression was associated with increased benefit-finding over time. The relati**onship **between improved depression and benefit-finding was significantly mediated by both increased optimism and increased positive affect. Conclusion: Findings provide support to both theoretical models. Positivity appears to promote benefit-finding in MS.  2008 American Psychological Association. eid: 2-s2.0-43049091568
30. **A randomized trial of telemedicine-based collaborative care for depression**
BACKGROUND: Evidence-based practices designed for large urban clinics are not necessarily portable into smaller isolated clinics. Implementing practice-based collaborative care for **depress**ion in smaller primary care clinics presents unique challenges because it is often not feasible to employ on-site psychiatrists. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the Telemedicine Enhanced **Antidep**ressant Management (TEAM) study was to evaluate a telemedicine-based collaborative care model adapted for small clinics without on-site psychiatrists. DESIGN: Matched sites were randomized to the intervention or usual care. PARTICIPANTS: Small VA Community-based outpatient clinics with no on-site psychiatrists, but access to telepsychiatrists. In 2003-2004, 395 primary care patients wi**th PHQ9** depression severity scores 12 were enrolled, and followed for 12 months. Patients with serious mental illness and current substance dependence were excluded. MEASURES: Medication adherence, treatment response, remission, health status, health-related quality of life, and treatment satisfaction. RESULTS: The **sampl**e comprised mostly elderly, white, males with substantial physical and behavioral health comorbidity. At baseline, subjects h**ad mode**rate depression severity (Hopkins Symptom Checklist, SCL-20 = **1.8), 3**.7 prior depression episodes, and 67%** had re**ceived prior depression treatment. Multivariate analyses indicated that intervention patients were more likely to be adherent at both 6 (odds ratio [OR] = 2.1, p = .04) and 12 months (OR = 2.7, p = .01). Intervention patients were more likely to respond by 6 months (OR = 2.0, p = .02), and remit by 12 months (OR = 2.4, p = .02). Intervention patients reported larger gains in mental health status and health-related quality of life, and reported higher satisfaction.

31. **Stepping up: Predictors of stepping within an icbt stepped-care intervention for depression**
Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) may overcome barriers to mental health care and has proven **efficaci**ous. However, this approach currently exists outside the existing mental health care delivery system. Stepped care is a proposed framework for integrating digital mental health (DMH) into health systems by initiating iCBT and stepping up care to a more intensive intervention should iCBT prove ineffective. This study explores pre-treatment factors associated with reaching stepping criteria among patients receiving iCBT. This exploratory **analysi**s of a stepped care arm of a larger randomized trial examined participants who were stepped to a more intensive intervention if they did not respond to iCBT. The association of pre-treatment factors on stepping were examined using KruskalWallis and Chi-square tests. One-fifth of the 151 participants met criteria for stepping within the 20-week treatment period. Only pre-treatment **depress**ion severity and treatment preference were associated with increased likelihood of stepping (p = 0.049 and 0.048, respectively). The low number of individuals who stepped provides support for iCBT as an effective, low intensity treatment **for dep**ression. The modest association of pre-tr**eatment** depression and preference to not receive iCBT may be useful in identifying patients who are less likely to respond.  2019 by the authors.

32. **Findings from a trial of the smartphone and online usage-based evaluation for depression (SOLVD) application: What do apps really tell us about patients with depression? concordance between app-generated data and standard psychiatric questionnaires for depression and anxiety**
Objective: **Depress**ion imposes a notable societal burden, with limited treatment success despite multiple available psychotherapy and medications choices. Potential reasons may include the heterogeneity** of dep**ression diagnoses and the presence of comorbid anxiety symptoms. Despite technological advances and the introduction of many mobile phone applications (apps) claiming to **relieve** depression,major gaps in knowledge still exist regarding what apps truly measure and how they correlate with psychometric questionnaires. The goal of this study was to evaluate whether mobile daily mood self-ratings may be useful in monitoring and **classif**ying depression symptoms **in a cl**inically depressed population compared with standard psychometric instruments including the Patient Health Questionaire-9 (PHQ-9), the Hamilt**on Rati**ng Scale for Depression (HAM-D), and the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A). Method: For this study,** 22 pat**ients with major depressive disorder with or without comorbid **anxiety disord**er were **recruit**ed. The diagnosis of depression was confirmed through the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). Over an 8-week period, daily moods were selfreported through the Smartphone and On**Line Us**age-based eValuation for Depression (SOLVD) application, a custom-designed application that was downlo**aded on**to patients' mobile devices. Depression and anxiety symptoms were also measured biweekly using the HAM-D, HAM-A, and PHQ-9. Results: Significant correlations were observed among self-evaluated mood, daily steps taken, SMS (text) frequency, average call duration, and biweekly psychometric scores (|r| > 0.5, P <0.05). The correlation coefficients were** higher** in individuals with more severe depressive symptoms. Conclusions: Although this study, given its limited **sampl**e size, was exploratory in nature, it helps fill a significant gap in our knowledge of the concordance between ratings obtained on the Ham-D, Ham-A, and the PHQ-9 psychometric instruments and data obtained via a smartphone app. These questionnaires represent goldstandard, commonly used psychiatric research/ clinical instruments, and, thus, this information can serve **as a fo**undation for digital phenotyping for depression and pave the way for interventional studies using smartphone applications.

33. **Evaluating the use of a computerized CBT program for outpatients on a waitlist in a university CBT unit**
Objectives and Design: The goal of this pilot randomized controlled trial was to determine whether a computerized cognitive-behavioral therapy (cCBT) program for **depress**ion and anxiety could reduce symptoms in outpatients on a waitlist for face-to-face CBT for a variety of mental health complaints. Methods: Sixty-seven outpatients referred for CBT for disparate problems (eg, anxie**ty, dep**ression, obsessions or compulsions) were randomized to 1 of 2 conditions: (1) the cCBT program "Good Days Ahead," which included weekly guidance and support, or (2) a control condition where patients were referred to a freely available online CBT workbook. Measures of psychological distress were administered at the start of study and at the end of the waiting period, when participants were formally diagnosed and assessed for face-to-face therapy. Results: For the most part, mixed-design analyses of variances revealed no statistically significant changes in symptom measures over time. Nonsignificant interactions and modest effect sizes between groups across time suggest that the cCBT group did not do better than the control group. The majority of cCBT participants reported that the program was "very" or "extremely useful," while only a portion of the control group felt the same about the workbook. There were notable differences in the completion rates of the 2 groups in favor of the cCBT program. Conclusions: Offering a general cCBT program to waiting list patients may not confer an advantage over referring them to an online workbook, at least in terms of symptom reduction. Results could be partly explained by difficulties translating knowledge into practice, especially if participants' main problem was not directly addressed by the intervention.

34. **Examining the effectiveness of a web-based intervention for symptoms of depression and anxiety in college students: Study protocol of a randomised controlled trial**
Introduction The college years are a peak period for the onset of common mental disorders. Poor mental health is associated with low academic attainment, physical, interpersonal and cognitive impairments. Universities can use online approaches to screen students for mental disorders and treat those in need. The present study aims to assess the effectiveness of a guided web-based transdiagnostic individually tailored intervention to treat students with symptoms of **depress**ion and/or anxiety. Methods and **analysi**s The present study is a randomised controlled trial. Participants are Dutch college students (18 years) with mild to moder**ate dep**ression and/or anxiety symptoms. The intervention is a guided web-based transdiagnostic individually tailored intervention that targets symp**toms of** depression and/or anxiety. The intervention consists of seven online sessions with a duration ranging from 4 to 7 weeks depending on individual progress. A booster session is administered 4 weeks after the completion of the seventh session. Primary outcome measures are the Patient Health Questi**onnaire** for depression and the Generalised **Anxiety Disord**er 7-item scale for anxiety. These scales are administered at screening, post-treatment and follow-up assessments (6 and 12 months post-randomisation). Ethics and dissemination The Medical Ethics Committee of the Vrije Universiteit Medical Centre has approved the protocol (registration number 2016.583, A2017.362andA2018.421).

Background: Patients with head and neck **cancer** (HNC) **experi**ence significant physical and psychological morbidity during radiotherapy (RT) that contributes to treatment interruptions and a poor quality of **life**. Although spouses/partners can help by encouraging patient self-management (eg, self-care) during RT, they of**ten ex**perience high psychological distress rates, lack basic health care knowledge and skills, and report increased marital conflict regarding patient self-management. The current pilot study examined the feasibility and acceptability of a 6-session **telephon**e-based intervention called Spouses coping with the Head And neck Ra**diatio**n Experience (SHARE), which teaches self-management, communication, and coping skills to patients with HNC and their spouses. The treatment effects of SHARE compared with usual medical care (UMC) in controlling patient physical symptoms and improving patient/spouse psychological and marital functioning also were examined. Methods: Thirty patients who initiated RT and their spouses (60 participants; 40% of whom were racial/ethnic minorities) were randomized to SHARE or UMC, and preintervention and postintervention assessments were completed. Results: Solid recruitment (70%) and low attrition rates (7%) demonstrated feasibility. Strong program evaluations and homework completion rates (72%) **support**ed acceptability. Significant treatment effects (medium in magnitude) were observed for SHARE compared with UMC with regard to HNC-specific physical symptom burden (Cohens d, -0.89) and symptom interference (Cohens d, -0.86). Medium to large effects favoring SHARE also were found for patient and spouse **depress**ive symptoms (Cohens d, -0.84) **and ca**ncer-specific distress (Cohens d, -1.05). Conclusions: The findings of the current st**udy sup**port the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of SHARE. They also suggest that programs that empower HNC couples with the necessary skills to coordinate care and manage the challenges of RT together hold great promise for controlling a patients physical symptoms and improving the psychological functioning of both partners.  2018 A**merica**n Cancer Society eid: 2-s2.0-85058017264
1. **Reducing disparity in outcomes for immigrants with cancer: A qualitative assessment of the feasibility and acceptability of a culturally targeted telephone-based supportive care intervention**
**Purpos**e: **Australia** has one of the most culturally diverse populations in the world. Immigrant **cancer** patients' poorer outcomes compared to English-speaking patients confirm the need for culturally sensitive **support**ive care interventions. The aims of this study were (1) to identify cultural sensitivities that are important to the acceptability of a **telephon**e-ba**sed sup**portive care intervention and (2) to identify cultural barriers and facilitators to intervention participation. Methods: Patients and carers attending Chinese or Ara**bic c**a**ncer** support groups were recruited. Two focus groups comprising 12 patients and 4 carers, and **two tele**phone interviews were conducted in the participants' own language. A semi-structured interview format was utilised to determine potential cultural sensitivities that may influence the intervention delivery format as well as patients' willingness to partici**pate in **tele**phone-b**ased supportive care interventions. Content analysis confirmed similar themes across groups. Results: The intervention was viewed favourably as a means of providing **informa**tion and support in the patient's language. Cultural considerations included assurances of confidential**ity, a**s cancer is not openly discussed within communities. An initial face-to-face contact was highlighted as the most important factor facilitating participation. Participants also recommended the inclusion of patient-initiated calls as part of the intervention. Conclusions: This study provides cultural insights relevant to the development of a culturall**y sensit****ive tel**ephone-based supportive care intervention for Arabic- and Chine**se-spe**aking **cancer pati**ents. Participants highlighted the need for face-to-face contact and inclusion of patient-initiated calls as important methodological considerations.  2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. eid: 2-s2.0-84879963882

3. **The Utility of Videoconferencing to Provide Innovative Delivery of Psychological Treatment for Rural Cancer Patients: Results of a Pilot Study**
The unmet psychological needs of rural **cancer** patients are numerous. Telepsychology is a novel and feasible option that may provide cost-savings and help overcome inequalities in access to specialists. This is the first known study of psychological treatment for people w**ith ca**ncer delivered entirely via videoconferencing. We hypothesized that a telepsychology service would improv**e rura**l **cancer pati**ents' anxiety and **depress**ion levels and quality of **life**, and would be an acceptable, satisfactory, and practical mode of service delivery. **Twenty**-f**ive cancer **patients attended an average of three sessions with a clinical psychologist providing brief cognitive-behavioral therapy. Questionnaires were completed at pre-, post-, and 1-month follow-up. Patients benefited in terms of anxiety (P = 0.01) and quality** of **life (P = 0.04). The service was both practical and acceptable. These preliminary positive results provide a firm basis to conduct a randomized controlled trial of face-to-face interaction vs. videoconferenc**ing.  **2006 U.S. Cancer Pain Relief Committee. eid: 2-s2.0-33750504036
4. **Using tailored telephone counseling to accelerate the adoption of colorectal cancer screening**
Background: Few interventions to increase colorectal **cancer** screening have used a stage of change model to promote screening adoption. None have used computer-assisted tailored **telephon**e counseling calls. This study's **purpos**e was to implement and evaluate stage-based computer-assisted tailo**red tele**phone counseling to promote colorec**tal ca**ncer screening in a primary care population. Methods: This randomized controlled trial used a two-stepped intervention that included a mailed booklet on col**orecta**l cancer screening followed by computer-a**ssisted **telephone counseling that was based on the Precaution Adoption Process Model. Chart audit was used to document completion of colonoscopy, sigmoidoscopy or fecal occult blood testing. Results: Record audits were completed on 2474 (88%) of the 2817 eligible participants. There was no significant difference in the frequency and nature of the screening tests completed in the study arms. In a sub-analysis, stages of adoption were evaluated pr**e- and p**ost-telephone counseling. Over half those receiving counseling reported a change in stage towards screening adoption. Conclusion: Overall, the intervention did not increase colorectal screening compared to control. Two possible reasons for the absence of a screening effect include: (a) the focus of the protocol on education for most patients rather than motivation, and (b) the requirement that patients interested in screening seek further information and a referral on their own from their providers. While **those re**ceiving telephone counseling improved their stage of adoption, we cannot rule out selection bias. Stronger physician recommendation to speak with the counselors could improve call acceptance. Future colorectal screening should address these weaknesses.  2007. eid: 2-s2.0-34547830870

ABSTRACT Background: Weekly telepsychiatry consultations have been provided since 2002 to six communities in Northwest Ontario. Staff from a single community psycho**geriatr**ic outreach service who work within these communities facilitate the referrals. Methods: The program evaluation included (a) a chart review of the last 100 referrals, (b) analysis of patient and staff evaluations, (c) a survey mailed to all physicians in referring communities, and (d) three focus groups of staff working in local community agencies. Results: The mean age at the time of consultation was 76.7 years. Sixty-eight percent of patients were females. The most frequent diagnoses were **dementia** (54%), depression (28%), and mild **cognit**ive impairment (19%). The most frequent medication recommendations were antidepressants or cholinesterase inhibitors. Two hundred ninety-four patient assessments and case consultations were carried out between 2002 and 2009. Post-session evaluation surveys rated the provision of information, whether objectives were met, and overall usefulness of recommendations. The mean scores for these questions on a 5-point scale were between 4.6 and 4.85. Referring physicians were confident and satisfied with the recommendations made for their patients. All planned to continue to use telepsychiatry as a care option for the future. The focus groups added useful information about challenges and potential barriers to utilizing the program. Conclusions: The program was rated as being highly valued across all modalities of evaluation. Members of the referring team believe that access t**o a ger**iatric psychiatrist has broadened the team's knowledge base, its use of assessment tools, and increased their ability to better construct their patients' treatment plans.

1. **ECHO-AGE: An Innovative Model of Geriatric Care for Long-Term Care Residents With Dementia and Behavioral Issues**
Objectives: To design, implement, and assess the pilot phase of an innovative, remote case-based video-consultation program called ECHO-AGE that links experts in the management of behavior disorders in patients with **dementia** to nursing home care providers. Design: Pilot study involving surveying of participating long-term care sites regarding utility of recommendations and resident outcomes. Setting: Eleven long-term care sites in Massachusetts and Maine. Participants: An interprofessional specialty team at a tertiary care center and staff from 11 long-term care sites. Intervention: Long-term care sites presented challenging cases regarding residents w**ith deme**ntia and/or delirium related behavioral issues to specialists via video-conferencing. Methods: Baseline resident characteristics and follow-up data regarding compliance with ECHO-AGE recommendations, resident improvement, hospitalization, and mortality were collected from the long-term care sites. Results: Forty-seven residents, with a mean age of 82years, were presented during the ECHO-AGE pilot period. Eighty-three percent of residents had a his**tory of **dementia and 44% were taking antipsychotic medications. The most **common** reasons for presentation were agitation, intrusiveness, and paranoia. Behavioral plans were recommended in 72.3% of patients. Suggestions for medication adjustments were also frequent. ECHO-AGE recommendations were completely or partially followed in 88.6% of residents. When recommendations were followed, sites were much more likely to report clinical improvement (74% vs 20%, P<.03). Hospitalization was also l**ess co**mmon among residents for whom recommendations were followed. Conclusions: The results suggest that a case-based video-consultation program can be successful in improving the care of **elders w**ith dementia and/or delirium related behavioral issues by linking specialists with long-term care providers.  2014. eid: 2-s2.0-84912534512
2. **Identifying undiagnosed dementia in residential care veterans: Comparing telemedicine to in-person clinical examination**
Background: **Dementia** is a **common** but frequently undiagnosed problem in aging. Barriers to early diagnosis include a lack of routine screening **for deme**ntia and a lack of access to specialty consultative services. We conducted a pilot study to see if telemedicine could provide reliable, accurate **geriatr**ic consultative services to evaluate patie**nts for **dementia who were residing at remote sites. Methods: This was a prospective cohort study that compared the diagnostic reliability of telemedicine to an in-person exam**ination **for dementia. Eligible subjects were residents of a Washington State Veterans' Home, age 60 years or older, with no pri**or diagn**osis of dementia. Eligible subject**s were s**creened for dementia using the 7-Minute Screen. Veterans who screened positive and consented to participate in the study received an in-person neuropsychiatric evaluation at baseline, and then both telemedicine and in-**person e**xaminations for dementia conducted by experien**ced ger**iatric psychiatrists. The accuracy of the telemedicine diagnosis was estimated by comparing it to the diagnosis from the clinical **examin**ation**. Three** geriatric psychiatrists who were blinded to the results of the clini**cal ex**amination conducted the telemedicine and in**-perso**n examinations. We also assessed attitudes of the s**ubjects** and geriatric psychiatrists towards the telemedicine sessions. Results: Eighteen of 85 subjects s**creened **were 'positive' for dementia on the 7 Minute Screen. Of these, 16 consented to participate in the telemedicine study. Twelve of the 16 subjects w**ere subs**equently diagnosed with dementia by the t**elemed**icine examination. The telemedicine diagnoses were in 100% agreement with the diagnoses from the in-**person** clinical examinations. Moreover, the subjects reported a high degree of satisfaction with the telemedicine experience and that they would like to have further care through telemedicine in **the fut**ure. The geriatric psychiatrists reported technical difficulties with the audio-visual quality of telemedicine in the initial phases of the project that resolved as familiarity with the telemedicine equipment increased. None of these problems had an adverse impact on the diagnostic accuracy of telemedicine. Conclusions: We found that telemedicine was as accurate as an** in-pe**rson clinical examinati**on in es**tablishing the diagnosis of dementia. In addition, subjects reported a high degree of satisfaction with telemedicine and a willingness to participate in telemedicine clinical care in the future. Given the large increase in the aging population **and the** shortage of geriatric psychiatrists nationally, it appears that telemedicine may be a promising means to exp**and the** availability of geriatric psychiatric consultation to remote areas.

3. **Cognitive intervention for community-dwelling older persons with memory problems: Telemedicine versus face-to-face treatment**
Background: Memory complaints and decline in **cognit**ive function are **common** in the eleder**ly. Co**gnitive intervention has been shown to be beneficial in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, few communit**y-base**d cognitive intervention programs are available in Hong Kong. The aim of this project is to **examin**e and compare the feasibility, acceptability, and clinical o**utcome** of a cognitive intervention program for older pat**ients **with mild cognitive impairment and mild **dementia** using telemedicine versus a conventional face-to-face method. Methods: Community-dwelling older subjects with m**ild** deme****ntia or mild cognitive impairments were recruited from a community center. A total of 12 ses**sions **of assessment and cognitive intervention were conducted via videoconferencing or by face-to-face method. Assessment included: Cantonese version of Mini Mental St**ate Ex**amination (C-MMSE), Cantonese version of Rivermead Behavioural Memory test (C-RBMT) and Hie**rarchic **Dementia Scale (HDS). Results: Twenty-two clients were recruited. There was** signi**ficant and comparable cognitive improvement in clients in both treatment arms. The videoconference arm was highly accepted by the clients and the community center. Overall compliance rate of participants was above 95%. Conclusions: Telemedicine was a feasible, effective an**d acce**ptable means in providing cognitive assessment and inte**rventi**on to older persons with mild cognitive deficits. Promoting such a program to other community settings would further enhance the acces**sibility** of dementia service to the community. Copyright  2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. eid: 2-s2.0-15344348363

0. **Informed collaboration in health care: An embedded-cases study in geriatric telepsychiatry**
Telemedicine, the delivery of medical consultation and services, is enabled by information and communications technologies. Participants in telemedicine consultation services (ie, clinicians, patients, and other parties) use video conferencing, special-purpose software and/or hardware, and data and notes from electronic medical records and other systems to formulate effective treatment plans. Telemedicine is a particular mode of informed **collabor**ationinformation and communications technologysuppor**ted coll**aborative **act**ivity i**n which **collaborators rely (wholly or in part) on digitally stored information retrieved from various sources to pursue their collective objectives. We report on an embedded-cases study of a long-running geriatric telepsychiatry clinic in the north-eastern **Unit**ed States. Our analysis draws on the theory of distributed cognition (DCog) to explicate the ways in which information and cognitive effort are distributed across individuals and a**rte**facts to support psychiatric consultation from a **distanc**e and how these processes play out over time in routines. On the basis of this case study, we offer a refinement of DCog theory, focusing on four interrelated dynamic processes that, we p**rop**ose, act as critical enablers **of infor**med collaboration: cognitive offloading, vi**sib**ility of action, intersubjective understanding, and knowledge redundanc**y. **We discuss practical implications for designing telemedicine services and tools, and we offer suggestions for further resea**rch on i**nformed collaboration.  2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd eid: 2-s2.0-85052650861
1. **Telemental health: Responding to mandates for reform in primary healthcare**
Telemental health (TMH) has established a niche as a feasible, acceptable, and effective service model to improve the mental healthcare and outcomes for individuals who cannot access traditional **mental health servic**es. The Accountability Care **Act** has mandated reforms in the structure, functioning, and financing of primary care that provide an opport**unit**y for TMH to move into the mainstream healthcare system. By partnering with the Integrated Behavioral Healthcare Model, TMH offers a spectrum of tools** to **unite primary care physicians and mental health specialist in a mind-body view of patients' healthcare needs and** to** activate patients in their own care. TMH tools include video-teleconferencing to telecommute mental health specialists to the primary care setting to **collabor**ate with a **team** in caring for patients' mental healthcare needs and to provide direct services to patients who are not progressing optimally with t**his coll**aborative model. Asynchronous tools include online therapies that offer an efficient first **step** to treatment for selected disorders such as depression and anxiety. P**ati**ents activate themselves in their care through portals that provide access to their healthcare information and Web sites that offer on-demand information and communication with a healthc**are **team. These synchronous and asynchronous TMH tools may move the site of mental healthcare from the clinic to the home. The evolving role of social media in facilitating communication among patients or with their hea**lthc**are team deserves further consideration a**s a** tool to activate patients and provide more personalized care.  2013, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-84896550617
2. **An Update on Telepsychiatry and How It Can Leverage Collaborative, Stepped, and Integrated Services to Primary Care**
Introduction: In this era of patient-centered care, telepsychiatry (TP; video or synchronous) provides quality care with outcomes as good as in-person care, facilitates access to care, and leverages a wide range of treatments at a **distanc**e. Method: This conceptual review article explores TP as applied to newer models of care (e.g., **collabor**ative, **step**ped, and integrated care). Results: The field of psychosomatic medicine (PSM) has developed clinical care models, educates interdisciplinary **team** members, and provides leadership to clini**cal **teams. PSM is uniquely positioned to steer TP and implement other telebehavioral health care options (e.g., e-mail/telephone, psych/mental health apps) in the future in primary care. Together, PSM and TP provide versatility to health systems by enabling more patient points-of-entry, matching patient needs with provider skills, and helping providers work at the top of their licenses. TP and other technologies m**ake coll**aborati**ve, **stepped, and integrated care less costly and more accessible. Conclusion: Effective health care delivery matches the intensity of the services to the needs of a patient population or clinic, standardizes interventions, and evaluates both process and clinical outcomes. More research is indicated on the application of TP and other technologies to these service delivery models.  2018 Academy of Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry. eid: 2-s2.0-85043382170

0. **Feasibility and effectiveness of telepsychiatry services for Chinese immigrants in a nursing home**
This study investigates the feasibility and effectiveness of providing telepsychiatry services to Chinese immigrants in a **nurs**ing **home**. The psychiatrist interviewed patients face-to-face for the initial consultation, and encouraged them to participate in this study to receive telepsychiatry-based follow-up visits. The feasibility and outcomes of telepsychiatry visits and satisfaction of the subjects, their families, and **the **nurs**ing **home **staff** were assessed. Nine monolingual Chinese immigrants, 8 women and 1 man, ranging from 54 to 88 years of age, were enrolled. The main reasons for psychiatric consultation were mood and behavioral problems. Eight of the 9 (88.9%) subjects participated in **videoconfer**ence follow-up visits, and 1 subject (11.1%) declined. Among the 8 subjects, 6 were referred for psychiatric intervention, 1 for differential diagnosis, and 1 for suicide assessment. At the end of the study, all 6 subjects referred for intervention had greatly improved; the subjects, their families, **and **the nurs**ing s**taff were highly satisfied with the telepsychiatry service. It is feasible to provide psychiatry consultations to ethnic immigr**ants** in a **nurs**ing home despite the fact that many of them are unfamiliar with the technology and suffer from dementia and psychotic symptoms. Telepsychiatry provides an efficient way for ethni**c el**ders** in ****nursing hom**es to connect with mental health professionals with the appropriate language and cultural background, regardless of location. Telepsychiatry may **decreas**e the disparities in treatment of mental illnesses among ethni**c im**migr**ants**** in nursing** homes.  2009, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-66149190915
1. **Telepsychiatry in psychogeriatric service: A pilot study**
A pilot study on telepsychiatry was conducted in which a **videoconfer**encing link was established between a regional hospital and a care and attention **home**. Using this system, a psychogeriatric outreach team provided 149 psychiatric assessments to 45 residents of the care and attent**ion **home over 11 mont**hs. Videoco**nferencing was found to be highly feasible. It was acceptable to **staff** and patients and more cost-effective than on-site visits.

2. **Benefits of a telepsychiatry consultation service for rural nursing home residents**
Psychiatric care for **nurs**ing **home** residents is difficult to obtain, especially in rural areas, and this deficiency may lead to significant morbidity or death. Providing this service by **videoconfer**ence may be a helpful, cost-effective, and acceptable alternative to face-to-face treatment. We analyzed data for 278 telepsychiatry encounters for **106 **nurs**ing **home residents to estimate potential cost and time savings associated with this modality compared to in-person care. A total of 843.5 hours (105.4 8-hour work days) of travel time was saved compared to in-person consultation for each of the 278 encounters if they had occurred separately. If four resident visits were possible for each trip, the time saved would **decreas**e to 26.4 workdays. Travel distance saved was 43,000 miles; 10,750 miles if four visits per trip occurred. More than $3,700 would be spent on gasoline for 278 separate encounte**rs; dec**reased to $925 for four visits per roundtrip. Personnel cost savings estimates ranged from $33,739 to $67,477. Physician costs associated with additional travel time ranged from $84,347 to $253,040 for 278 encounters, or from $21,087 to $63,260 for four encounters per visit. The telepsychiatry approach was enthusiastically accepted by virtually all residents, family members**, an**d **nurs**ing home personnel, and led to successful patient management. Providing psychiatric care t**o ru****ral ****nursing hom**e residents** by videoco**nference is **cost effect**ive and appears to be a medically acceptable alternative to face-to-face care. In addition, this approach will** all****ow m****any nursing** homes to provide essential care that would not otherwise be available.  2010 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-76349109253

0. **A model for digital mental healthcare: Its usefulness and potential for service delivery in low- and middle-income countries**
Background: Using digital technology to deliver mental health care can possibly serve as a **viabl**e adjunct or alternative to mainstream services in lessening the mental health gap in a large number of resource deficient and LAMI countries. Conventional models of **telepsychiatr**ic services available so far, however, have been inadequate and ineffective, as these address only a small component of care, and rely on engagement of specialists who are grossly insufficient in numbers. Aim: To describe an innovative digital model of mental health care, enabling and empowering the non-specialists to deliver **high** quality mental health care in remote areas. Methods: The model is powered by an online, fully automated clinical decision support system (CDSS), with interlinked modules for diagnosis, management and follow-up, usable by non-specialists after brief training and minimal supervision by psychiatrist, to deliver mental health care at remote sites. Results: The CDSS has been found to** be **highly reliable, feasible, with sufficient sensitivity and specificity. This paper describes the model and initial experience with the digital mental health care system deployed in three geographically difficult and remote areas in northern hill states in India. The online system was found to be reasonably comprehensive, brief, feasible, user-friendl**y, w**ith high levels of patient **satisfact**ion. 2594 patients assessed at the three remote sites and the nodal center represented varied diagnoses. Conclusions: The digital model described here has the potential to serve as an effective alternative or adjunct for delivering compre**hens**ive and high quality mental health care in LAMI countries like India in the primary and secondary care settings.  2019 Indian Journal of Psychiatry. eid: 2-s2.0-85059851863
1. **Videoconferencing in a mental health service in The Netherlands: A randomized controlled trial on patient satisfaction and clinical outcomes for outpatients with severe mental illness**
Introduction: The goal of the study was to determinate if there was added value in the use of videoconferencing (VCF) in **outpati**ent care for people with severe mental illness (SMI). Methods: A VCF-group was compared to a control group (care as usual) over a period of 18 months. Block **random**ization was used to assign patients to one of the two groups. The video communication was available to the patients on a 24/7 basis, so that emergency calls could also be made via VCF. The primary outcome was patient **satisfact**ion, other outcomes were: quality of life, loneliness, daily functioning (psychologically and socially), and the fulfilment of needs of care. Eventually, 93 patients signed their informed consent and participated. Results: For the primary outcome a statistically significant time by treatment interaction effect was found, where **high**er degree** of satis**faction was associated with the patients in the VCF-group. The secondary outcomes revealed no differences between the two groups. Despite the participants not using the VCF units extensively during the **project**, they were reasonably satisfied with VCF; on average, they rated the service with a 7.5 grade (on a scale from 110). Discussion: Although the study showed a positive result for **patient s**atisfaction, overall the VCF seemed to have limited impact. So VCF might not offer much added value to care as usual. However, statistical power in this study dropped somewhat due to dropout. Furthermore, VCF usage was lower than expected. Assuming that VCF will be most effective if it is actually used, it seems likely that the actual effect-size reached in this study has been significantly lower than the anticipated effect-size. Finally, this study shows that VCF is a **tool** that can be used in the care for people with severe mental illness.  2016,  The Author(s) 2016. eid: 2-s2.0-85020199870
2. **Disagreement in satisfaction between patients and providers in the use of videoconferences by depressed adults**
Aim: To evaluate whether there was a difference in **satisfact**ion scores between providers and patients in the use of videoconferences (VCs) by depressed adults. Method: This study was a subanalysis of the joint European **project**, MasterMind, and participants were recruited from 15 pilot studies in 11 different countries. The Cli**ent Satis**faction Questionnaire (CSQ)-3 was used as assessment **tool**, and scores were summed to give total scores. The questionnaire consists of three items evaluating **general s**atisfaction, fulfillment of needs in treatment, and usability. Results: A total of 362 respondents, 201 patients and 161 providers, completed the questionnaire. Providers had a mean total CSQ-3 score of 9.17 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 8.90-9.45), whereas patients had a mean of 9.70 (95% CI = 9.44-9.98). Mean scores for item 1 (the extent to which VCs had met the needs of the participants): Patients 3.19, providers 2.93 (p = 0.00048); for item** 2 (gener**al satisfaction): Patients 3.22, providers 3.08 (p = 0.083); and item 3 (whether participants wanted to use VCs again): Patients 3.28 providers 3.16 (p = 0.045). Conclusion: The results sh**owed that** total satisfaction scores were **high**er in patients than in providers. The differences between patients and providers were significant for items 1 and 3 (p < 0.05), but we did not find a significant difference regarding item 2.  2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-85084654748
3. **A randomized clinical trial of home-based telepsychiatric outpatient care via videoconferencing: Design, methodology, and implementation**
Background: Healthcare providers are continuously challenged to find innovative, cost-effective alternatives and to scale up existent services to meet the growing demand upon mental health care delivery. Due to continuous advances in technologies, **telepsychiatr**y has become an effective **tool** for psychiatric care. In 2012, the Institute of Psychiatry of the University of So Paulo Medical School started a **random**ized clinical trial of home-ba**sed telepsych**iatric **outpati**ent care via videoconferencing. Objective: The objective of this article is to describe the design, methodology and implementation of a pilot **project**, which aimed to verify the applicability and efficiency of psychiatric attendance via Internet-based videoconferencing in a resource-constrained environment. Methods: **The pro**ject consisted of a 12 months follow-up study wit**h a ra**ndomized clinical trial, which compared various quality indicators between hom**e-based telep**sychiatric aftercare via videoconferencing and face-to-face aftercare. Results: The final sample comprised **107 out**patients** (53 in the t**elepsychiatry group and 54 in the control group). Among 1,227 realized consultations, 489 were held by videoconferencing. **Satisfact**ion with the aftercare by videoconferencing and the medication delivery was **high** among patients. Attending psychiatrists were satisfied with the assistance by videoconferencing. Discussion: The experiences during thi**s pilot** project have overall been very positive and psyc**hiatric** **outpatient car**e by videoconferencing seems **viabl**e to treat patients even in a resource-constrained environment.  2015, Lemos Editorial e Graficos Ltda.

The telehealth field has advanced historic promises to improve access, cost, and quality of care. However, the extent to which it is delivering on its promises is unclear as the scientific evidence needed to justify success is st**ill** emerging. Many have identified the need to advance the scientific knowledge base to better quantify success. One method for advancing that knowledge base is a standard telemental health **evalu**ation model. Telemental health is defined here as the provision of mental health services using live, interactive video-teleconferencing technolo**gy. E**valuation in the telemental health field largely consists of descriptive and small pilot studies, is often defined by the individual goals of the specific programs, and is typically focused on only one outcome. The field should ad**opt n**ew evaluation methods that consider the co-adaptive interaction between users (patients and providers), healthcare costs and savings, and the rapid evolution in communication technologies. Acceptance of** a st**andard evaluation mod**el **will improve perceptions of telemental health as an established field, promote development of a sounder empirical base, promote interagency collaboration, and provide a **framework** for more multidisciplinary research that integrates measuring the impact of the technology and the overall healthcare aspect. We suggest that consideration of a standard model is timely given where telemental health is at in terms of its stage of scientific progre**ss.** We will broadly recommend some elements of what **such **a standard evaluation model might include for telemental health and suggest a way forward for adopting such a model.

2. **Towards a Framework for Evaluating Mobile Mental Health Apps**
Introduction: **Mobil**e phones are ubiquitous in society and owned by a majority of psychiatric patients, including those with severe mental **ill**ness. Their versatility as a platform can extend mental health services in the areas of communication, self-monitoring, self-management, diagnosis, and treatment. However, the efficacy and reliability of publicly available applications (apps) have yet to be demonstrated. Numerous articles have noted the need for rigorous **evalu**ation of the efficacy and clinical utility of **smartphon**e apps, which are largely unregulated. Professional clinical organizations do not provide guidelines **for e**valuat**ing m**obile apps. Materials and Methods: Guidelines and **framework**s are ne**eded **to evaluate medical apps. Numerous fra**mewor**ks and evaluation criteria exist from the engineering and informatics literature, as well as interdisciplinary organizations in similar fields such as telemedicine and healthcare informatics. Results: We propose criteria for both patients and providers to use in assessing not j**ust smart**phone apps, but also wearable devices and smartwatch apps for mental heal**th. A**pps can be evaluated by their usefulness, usability, and integration and infrastructure. Apps can be categorized by their usability in one or more stages of a mental health provider's workflow. Conclusions: Ultimately, leadership is needed to develo**p a frame**work for describing apps, and guidelines are needed for both patients and mental health providers.

3. **Feasibility of popular m-health technologies for activity tracking among individuals with serious mental Illness**
Obesity prevalence is nearly double among individuals with serious mental **ill**ness (SMI), including schizophrenia spectrum disorders, bipolar disorder, or major depressive disorder, compared with the **gener**al population. Emerging **mobil**e health (m-health) technologies are increasingly available and offer the potential to support lifestyle interventions targeting weight loss, yet the practical feasibility of using these technologies in this high-risk group has not been established. We **evalu**ated the feasibility and acceptability of popular m-health technologies for activity tracking among overweight and obese individuals with SMI. We provided wearable activity monitoring devices (FitBit [San Francisco, CA] Zip or Nike Inc. [Beaverton, OR] FuelBand) and **smartphon**es (Apple [Cupertino, CA] iPhone 4S) for accessing **the smart**phone application for each device to participants with SMI enrolled in a weight loss program. Feasibility of these devices was measured by the frequency of use over time. Acceptability was measured through qualitative follow-up interviews with participants. Ten participants with SMI wore the devices for a mean of 89% (standard deviation=13%) of the days in the study. Five participants wore the devices 100% of the time. Participants reported high satisfaction, stating the devices were easy to use, helpful for setting goals, motivational, and useful for self-monitoring. Several participants liked the social connectivity feature of the devices where they could see each other's progress** on the s**martphone application, noting that "friendly" competition increased motivation to be more physically active. This study supports using popular m-health technologies for activity tracking among individuals with SMI. These findings can inform the design of weight loss interventions targeting this vulnerable patient population.  Copyright 2015, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2015. eid: 2-s2.0-84924815083

Background: Most of the early **psychosi**s intervention (EPI) training has focused on family physicians participants. In Northern Ontario, there is a shortage of primary care. This paper will present **evalu**ation results of a pilot training programme for rural and **remot**e youth mental health service providers. Method: A mixed methods approach was used.** We e**valuated a 2-day workshop about EPI for non-medical mental health workers delivered onsite and simultaneously by videoconferencing. There were 19 participants across four agencies. Seven were onsite and 12 were offsite. Participants' knowledge was measured using a validated questionnaire at pre-intervention and at 3-, 6- and 9-**month** **follow up**. A repeated measures ANOVA was **used **to evaluate knowledge acquisition between the two modes of training. A**t 6 m**onths, focus group interviews were conducted to explore their experiences of the mode of intervention d**elive**ry and evaluation. Emerging themes were iteratively derived through a series of discussions involving independent coders. Results: Only 15 complete datasets were available of the 19 original participants. Differences in knowledge acquisition between the two groups did not reach statistical differen**ce. S**ix-month focus group data indicated that participants improved their relationship with EPI services and they were part of a strengthened network with other providers in the region. Post-intervention, the accuracy of referrals from participating agencies increased dramatically, with an increase in proportion of referrals who were eligible for EPI services. The follow-up process engaged participants in learning and re-engaged them with the material taught during the training session. Conclusions: The results about developing service partnerships and relationship with specialist services are encouraging for policy and service decision-makers to address mental health service needs in northern **and r**emote areas.  2013 Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd. eid: 2-s2.0-84886747839
1. **A self-guided relaxation module for telepsychiatric services: Development, usefulness, and feasibility**
Objective: A modified form of the standard autogenic relaxation exercise was developed as part of a telepsychiatry project, which aims to deliver mental healthcare to **remot**e areas through the net, and through the agency of non-specialists. This study describes the development and **evalu**ation of a brief and simpler form of a relaxation technique, the Self-Guided Relaxation (SGR). Method: SGR is a systematic technique to focus on muscle groups and feel the heaviness and relaxation through suggestions to induce relaxation in the body. The SGR was taught to 37 patients with different psychiatric disorders over two sessions a week apart. Measures of change used were scores on the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) and a visual analog scale. Its usefulness and feasibility was examined over a follow-up period of one **month**. Additionally a group of non-specialists was trained in SGR supplemented by audiovisual aids and printed instructions. These therapists **rate**d the ease in learning and administering SGR in patients. Results: There was a consistent reduction in the HAM-A scores over the follow-up period among patients. Improvements were also noted in positive experiences, adherence, depth of relaxation achieved, perceived benefit, and **patient satisfact**ion. Majority of the patients, relatives, and therapists reported that they could administer or practice SGR after having learned the technique in a single session lasting about 30 minutes. The use of audio-video aids and manual was helpful in making the process of learning easy. Conclusions: Preliminary findings of usefulness, feasibility, and acceptance of the SGR were encouraging. These findings pave way for larger, randomized controlled study and for testing applicability of the SGR as a net-based psychological intervention.  2013, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-84896463918
2. **Predictors of 12-month outcome in smokers who received bupropion sustained-release for smoking cessation**
Aim: To examine heterogeneity in outcome at 12 **month**s following 8 weeks of treatment for smoking cessation with bupropion sustained-release (SR) 150 or 300 mg/day combined with behavioural counselling. Design, setting, participants: Smokers were recruited from a large healthcare system and then randomized to receive either bupropion SR 150 mg/day (n = 763) or 300 mg/day (n = 761) taken for 8 weeks in combination with either proactive telephone counselling or a tailored mail approach. Measurements and findings: A comprehensive set of relevant individual pretreatment and treatment characteristics was included in the analysis. Smoking outcome at** 12 m**onths was defined as point-prevalence of any regular self-reported smoking within the 7 days prior to follow-up contact. Classification and regression tree analysis identified subgroups that varied with respect to likelihood of being nonsmoker**s at **12 months. Seven subgroups were identified among those receiving bupropion SR 150 mg/day (proportion of nonsm**okers** at 12 months ranged from 13.7% to 43.5%) and eight subgroups among those receiving bupropion SR 300 mg/day (proportion of n**onsmo**kers at 12 months ranged from 9.6% to 51.7%). In the 150-mg/day group, those with the lowest **rate** reported no previou**s qui**t attempt of 1 month or more in duration while those with the **high****est **rate all reported prev**ious **quit attempts of 1 month or longer. In the 300 mg/day group, those with the** low**est rate had v**ery **high levels of dependence while those with ****th**e **highest rat**e we**re more highly educated and smoked at a lower level. Across** all **subgroups, cost per 12-month quitter ranged from a low** of **$US302 to a high of $US2502. Conclusions: These results indicate the presence of a substantial amount of variation in outcome following treatment with both dosages of bupropion SR, with substantial cost consequences. Variation in outcome could be reduced by providing treatments tailored to subgroups of individuals who a**re a**t exceptionally high risk for smoking following a quit attempt.  2008 Adis Data Information BV.

3. **Identification of the hikikomori syndrome of social withdrawal: Psychosocial features and treatment preferences in four countries**
Background: Hikikomori, a form of social withdrawal first reported in Japan, may exist globally but cross-national studies of cases of hikikomori are lacking. Aims: To identify individuals with hikikomori in multiple countries and describe features of the condition. Method: Participants were recruited from sites in India, Japan, Korea and the United States. Hikikomori was defined as a 6-**month** or longer period of spending almost all time at home and avoiding social situations and social relationships, associated with significant distress/impairment. Additional measures included the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Loneliness Scale, Lubben Social Network Scale (LSNS-6), Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) and modified Cornell Treatment Preferences Index. Results: A total of 36 participants with hikikomori were identified, with cases detected in all four countries. These individuals had **high** levels of loneliness (UCLA Loneliness Scale M = 55.4, SD = 10.5), limited social networks (LSNS-6 M = 9.7, SD = 5.5) and mode**rate** functional impairment (SDS M = 16.5, SD = 7.9). Of them 28 (78%) desired treatment for their social withdrawal, with a significan**tly **higher preference for psychotherapy over pharmacotherapy, in-person over telepsychiatry treatment and mental health specialists over primary care providers. Across countries, participants with hikikomori had similar generally treatment preferences and psychosocial features. Conclusion: Hikikomori exists cross-nationally and can be assessed with a standardized assessment tool. Individuals with hikikomori have substantial psychosocial impairment and disability, and some may desire treatment.  2014 The Author(s). eid: 2-s2.0-84921878511

0. **The Childrens Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Telemental Health Treatment Study: Caregiver Outcomes**
The **Child**rens Attention-deficit **Hyperact**ivity Disorder (ADHD) Telemental Health Treatment Study (CATTS) tested the hypotheses t**hat c**hildren and caregivers who received guideline-based treatment delivered through a hybrid telehealth service delivery model would experience greater improvements in outcom**es th**an children and caregivers receiving treatment via a comparison delivery model. Here, we present caregiver outcomes. 88 primary care providers (PCPs) in seven geographically underserved communities r**eferr**ed 223 children (ages 5.5  12.9years) to the randomized controlled trial**. Ove**r 22weeks, children randomized to the CATTS service delivery model received six sessions of telepsychiatry and six sessions of caregiver **behavior** management training provided in person by community therapists who were trained and s**uperv**ised remotely. Children randomized to the comparison Augmented Primary Care (APC) service model received management in primary care augmented by a single telepsychiatry consultation. Caregiver outcomes included changes in distress, as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), **Parent**ing Stress Index (PSI), Caregiver Strain Questionnaire (CSQ) and Family Empowerment Scale (FES). Caregivers completed five assessments. Multilevel mixed effects regression modeling tested for differences between the two service delivery models in caregiver outcomes from baseline to 25weeks. Co**mpare**d to caregivers of children in t**he AP**C model, caregivers of children in the CATTS service model showed statistically significantly greater improvements on the PHQ-9 ( = -1.41, 95% CI = [2.74, 0.08], p <.05), PSI ( = 4.59, 95% CI = [7.87,  1.31], p <.001), CSQ ( = 5.41, 95% CI = [ 8.58, 2.24], p <.001) and FES ( = 6.69, 95% CI = [2.32, **11.06**], p <.01). Improvement in child ADHD symptoms mediated improved caregiver scores** on t**he PSI and CSQ. Improvement in child **ODD beha**viors mediated caregiver CSQ scores. The CATTS trial supports the effectiveness of a hybrid telehealth service delivery model** for **reducing distress in caregivers of children with ADHD and suggests a mechanism through whichthe service model affected caregiver distress.  2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York. eid: 2-s2.0-85008675424
1. **Parental attitudes to a telehealth parent coaching intervention for autism spectrum disorder**
Introduction: This study examined the potential feasibility of tele-delivered **parent** coaching in a rural area of Italy through a survey** of pa**rents attitudes towards this type of intervention. M**ethods**: Parents of all **child**ren up to six years of age registered with a diagnosis of **autism** spectrum disorder at the clinic catering for the area were invited to take part in the study. The final sample cons**isted **of 43 pa**rents.** Results: Parents with worse Internet skills and those who reported lower levels of satisfaction with currently received services were less likely to be willing to enrol. Th**ere wa**s a trend for parents with lower self-efficacy to be less likely to enrol. Educational level, previous experience of video-calling, travel time to the clinic **and c**hilds level of ability were not associated with the choice of enrolment. Discussion: Implications for strategies to contrast barriers to adoption and strengthen implementation plans are discussed.  2016,  The Author(s) 2016. eid: 2-s2.0-85018777751
2. **Using telepsychology to provide a group parenting program: A preliminary evaluation of effectiveness**
Telepsychology offers the potential to reach rural and underserved **child**ren and families with mental health concerns. The current study evaluated the effects of using videoconferencing technology to deliver an evidence-based **parent**ing program, the Group Triple P Posit**ive Pa**renting Program (Group Triple P; Turner, Markie-Dadds, & Sanders, 2002), with families who ha**d a c**hild experiencing **behavior**al problems. Using a pre/post design, families (N = 13) from low socioeconomic backgrounds in Kentucky completed the Group Triple P via a videoconferencing delivery format. A benchmarking strategy (Weersing & Hamilton, 2005) indicated that treatment effect sizes for the videoconferencing format were generally comparable to treatment effect sizes for Group Triple P studies conducted in-person. Specif**icall**y, child behav**ior an**d parenting outcomes were similar across delivery formats. Implications of the study's findings and future directions for telepsychology research and practice with underserved f**amili**es and children are discussed.  2015 **American** Psychological Association. eid: 2-s2.0-84938206433
3. **Usability and reliability of a remotely administered adult autism assessment, the autism diagnostic observation schedule (ADOS) module 4**
Introduction: The **Autism** Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) Module 4 is** an au**tism assessment designed for verbally fluent adolescents and adults. Because of a shortage of available clinical expertise, it can be difficult for adults to receive a** prope**r **autism spectrum** disorder (ASD) diagnostic assessment. A potential option to address this shortage is remote assessment. The objective of this study was to examine the feasibility, usability, and reliability of administering the ADOS Module 4 remotely using the Versatile and Integrated System for Telerehabilitation (VISYTER). Materials and Methods: VISYTER consists of computer stations at the client site and clinician site for video communication and a Web portal for managing and coordinating the assessment process. Twenty-three adults with an ASD diagnosis participated in a within-subject crossover design study in which both a remote ADOS and a face-to-face ADOS were administered. After completing the remote ADOS, participants completed a satisfaction survey. Results: Participant satisfaction with the remote ADOS delivery system was high. The kappa value was greater than 0.61 on 21 of 31 ADOS items. There was substantial agreement on ADOS classification (i.e., diagnosis) between assessments delivered face-to-face versus assessments delivered remotely (interclass coefficient=0.92). Non-agreement may have been due to outside factors or practice effect despite a washout period. Conclusions: The results of this study demonstr**ate th**at an autism assessment designed to be delivered face to face can be administered remotely using an integrated Web-based system with high levels of usability and reliability.

4. **An integrated telehealth system for remote administration of an adult autism assessment**
We developed a telehealth system to administer an **autism** assessment remotely. The remote assessment system integrates videoconferencing, stimuli presentation, recording, image and video presentation, and electronic assessment scoring into an intuitive software platform. This is an advancement over existing technologies used in telemental health, which currently require several devices. The number of **child**ren, adolescents, and adults w**ith au**tism spectrum disorders (ASDs) has increased dramatically over the past 20 years and is expected to continue to increase in coming years. In general, there are not many clinicians trained in either the diagnosis or treatment of adults with ASD. Given the number of adul**ts wit**h autism in need, a remote assessment system can potentially provide a solution to the lack of trained clinicians. The goal is to make the remote assessment system as close to face-to-face assessment as possible, yet versatile enough to support deployment in underserved areas. The primary challenge to achieving this goal is that the assessment requires social interaction that appears natural and fluid, so the remote system needs to be able to support fluid natural interaction. For this study we developed components to support this type of interaction and integrated these components into a system capable of supporting the entire autistic assessment protocol. We then implemented the system and evaluated the system on real patients. The results suggest that we have achieved our goal in developing a system with high-quality interaction that is easy to use.

6. **A web-based tutorial for parents of young children with Autism: Results from a pilot study**
Objective: Early intervention can significantly improve long-term outcomes for **child**ren with **autism**. Unfortunately, m**any c**hildren do not receive early intervention services due to a critical shortage of trained professionals in this area. To bridge this gap, we evaluated a Web-based **parent** training tutorial (Enhancing Interactions), based on evidence-based practices and utilizing the Web-based platform to maximize learning. Methods: Twenty-th**ree pa**rents** with** a child between 18 months and 6 years with** an au**tism spectrum disorder participated. Pre-and posttest sc**ores o**f parents' knowledge were used to evaluate tutorial effectiveness. The system usability scale (SUS) evaluated technical user-friendliness and the user satisfaction questionnaire (USQ), gauged satisfaction with content. Results: The mean number of correct items on the posttest significantly increased, from 12.6 to 20.4, p<0.001. The mean SUS score was 85 (standard deviation=17), corresponding to a score of "excellent." All participants found the tutorial user friendly, well integrated, and 96% (all but one participant) thought it was easy to use, felt confident using the technical features, and would use a tutorial like this again. On the USQ, all participants found that the tutorial was well organized, clearly presented, and easy to understand; that it increased their knowledge about communicating** with** their child; and that they felt capable of applying these techni**ques **with their child. Conclusions: The tutorial appears effective in** incre**asing parents' knowledge with high user satisfaction.  2011, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-82455179552
7. **Effectiveness of a telehealth service delivery model for treating attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: A community-based randomized controlled trial**
Objective To test the effectiveness of a telehealth service delivery model for the treatment of **child**ren with attention-deficit/**hyperact**ivity disorder (ADHD) that provided pharmacological treatment and caregiver **behavior** training. Method **The C**hildren's ADHD Telemental Health Treatment Study (CATTS) was a randomized controlled trial w**ith 2**23 children referred by 88 primary care providers (PCPs) in 7 c**ommun**ities. Children randomized to the experimental telehealth service model received 6 sessions over 22 weeks of combined pharmacotherap**y, de**livered by child psychiatrists through videoconferencing, and caregi**ver beha**vior training, provided in person by community therapists who were s**uperv**ised remotely. Children randomized to the control service delivery model received treatment with their PCPs augmented with a telepsychiatry consultation. Outcomes were diagnostic criteria for ADHD and oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) and role performance on the Vanderbilt ADHD Rating Scale (VADRS) completed by caregivers (VADRS-Caregivers) and teachers (VADRS-Teachers) and impairment on the Columbia Impairment Scale-**Parent** Version (CIS-P). Measures were completed at 5 assessments** over** 25 weeks. Results Children in bo**th se**rvice models improved. Children assigned to the telehealth service model i**mprov**ed significantly more than children in the augmented primary care arm for VADRS-Caregiver criteria for inattention (2[4] = 19.47, p &lt;.00**1), hype**ractivity (2[4] = 11.91, p =.02), combined ADHD (2[4] = 14.90, p =.005), ODD (2[4] = 10.05, p =.04), and VADRS-Caregiver role performance (2 [4] = 12.40, p =.01) and CIS-P impairment (2[4] = 20.52, p &lt;.001). For the** VADR**S-Teacher diagnostic criteria, children in the telehealth service model had significantly more improve**ment in **hyperactivity (2[4] = 11.28, p =.02) and combined ADHD (2[4] = 9.72, p =.045). Conclusion The CATTS trial demonstrated the effectiveness of a telehealth service model to treat ADHD in communities with limited access to specialty mental health services.

8. **The modified checklist for autism in toddlers: A follow-up study investigating the early detection of autism spectrum disorders**
**Autism** spectrum disorders (ASD) often go undetected in toddlers. The Modified Checklist **for Au**tism in Toddlers (M-CHAT) was used to screen 3,793 **child**ren aged 16-30 months from low- and high-risk sources; screen positive cases were diagnostically evaluated. Re-screening was performed on 1,**416 c**hildren aged 42-54 months. Time1 Positive Predictive Value (PPV) was .36 for the initial screening and .74 for the screening plus follow-up telephone interview; values were similar for Time2 PPV. When separating referral sources, PPV was low for the low-risk sample but acceptable with the follow-up telephone int**ervie**w. Children with ASD from the low-risk and high-risk samples were highly similar. Results indicate that the M-CHAT continues to be a promising instrument for the early detection of ASD.  2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC. eid: 2-s2.0-42649127380
9. **Telemedicine and autism spectrum disorder in children and adolescents: Theoretical and practical guide [Tlmdecine et troubles du spectre de l'autisme de l'enfant et de l'adolescent: guide thorique et pratique]**
Objectives: The development of telemedicine for **child**ren and adolescents is a real need because of difficult accessibility of mental health and the paucity** of c**hildhood psychiatrists. Thus the **American** Acad**emy f**or Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP) published in 2008 good practice recommendations for teleps**ychia**try in children and adolescents based on clinical consensus and scientific evidence. In France the legal framework defines four practical modalities according to the presence or not of a health professional or a psychologist with the practitioner accomplishing the teleconsultation act. Data exist about** the **outcome of children and adolescents who benefited from therapeutic interventions with technological media. Effect size is modest but it doesn't justify ruling ou**t the**se techniques. Children who present with a developmental disorder or who cannot cooperate are evaluated with a certain degree of uncerta**inty.** By contrast, some children with severe Attention Deficit with or without **Hyperact**ivity (ADHD), social anxiety or **Autism** Spectrum Disorders (ASD) can be more easily engaged within a teleconsultation model. Teleconsultations** in au**tism spectrum disorders (ASD) are feasible because of the nature of diagnosis and the type of care recommended in this disorder. The **behavior**al nature of the disorder and **the beha**vioral therapeutic approaches recommended in North America culture highlight the potential interest of telemedicine because these disorders are easily observable. Literature suggests new opportunities in order to facilitate the care process for the ASD person and his family: the first one is diagnosis with use of validated instruments such** as th**e Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (AD**OS) an**d the Autism Diagnostic Interview (ADI). **Parent**al accompaniment is the second opportunity. Development of telemedicine for ASD could be a complementary approach for diagnosis and medical care. Method: Since 2015, a program called PROMETTED (PROgramme MEdical de Tlpsychiatrie pour enfants et adolescents prsentant un Trouble Envahissant du Dveloppement) was supported by Regional Health Agency of le-de-France. It was developed and managed by the team of a Diagnosis Center** Evalu**ation for Autism (DCEA) of Paris area in collaboration with a DCEA of le-de-France region. Five m**edico**-social structures for children and adolescents with autistic disorders and the two diagnosis center**s of e**valuation for autism co-elaborated a scheme of intervention with telemedicine. The remote evaluation is a 4-step process: a first teleconsultation structured around the medical history of the subject in order to complete his medical file and the observation of the young subject; a second teleconsultation structured around the ADI-R interview w**ith pa**rents; the third teleconsultation is a mixed teleconsultation associating the medical expert of the DCEA and a psychol**ogist** trained in t**he use** of the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) and the Vineland A**daptive **Behavior Scales (VABS). The fourth teleconsultation consists of the psychiatrist giving feed-**back t**o parents about the results of the observations of the DCEA team. Results: The four-step program is well-accepted and the use of validated instruments for diagnosis or functional evaluation appears feasible. Medical data were completed for 44% of cases; complementary genetic or medical investigations were prescribed for 50% of cases; medical advice about psychotropic or vitaminic medication was given for 31% of cases. Mean duration of evaluation was 11.1 weeks  9.4. Conclusions: The PROMETTED program empirically validates t**he co**ncept of remote evaluation for children and adolescents with ASD. The need to extend the use of telemedicine to tele-expertise for medicine mo**nitoring** or behavioral disorder management has been noted.  2019 Elsevier Masson SAS eid: 2-s2.0-85065535811
10. **Clinician perspectives delivering telehealth interventions to children/families impacted by pediatric traumatic brain injury**
Purpose: Technological advances have made the delivery of psychological interventions via web-based platforms increasingly feasible. In recent years, there has been growth in the delivery of psychological interventions through web-based modalities, that is, telepsychology. Although there is evidence supporting the usability and feasibility of telepsychology for a range of populations, there is limited literature on clinician perceptions delivering telepsychology, particularly to pediatric rehabilitation populations. In this mixedmethods study, we report on clinician perspectives and experiences delivering telepsychology to **child**ren/ families impacted by pediatric traumatic brain injury. Method: Seventeen clinicians (psychologists and advanced psychology doctoral students) who delivered telepsychology interventions** to c**hildren/families impacted by pediatric brain injuries completed surveys and interviews. Results: Overall, clinicians reported that telepsychology was equivalent to face-to-face treatment in many regards (e.g., therapeutic alliance, weekly pr**ogres**s, child/family engagement, and establishing rapport). Clinicians reported a number of advantages of telepsychology over face-to-face interventions for this pediatric population including greater ease of scheduling, increased understanding of the family and home environments, and less caregiver stigma of **behavior**al health care. Disadvantages of telepsychology included difficulties reading nonverbal cues, logistical/technological issues, and greater disruptions during sessions. Conclusions: Findings provide an important foundation for future investigations examining the merits of telepsychology versus traditional treatment for both pediatric rehabilitation populations.  2019 **American** Psychological Association. eid: 2-s2.0-85062274795

0. **Study to promote innovation in rural integrated telepsychiatry (SPIRIT): Rationale and design of a randomized comparative effectiveness trial of managing complex psychiatric disorders in rural primary care clinics**
Objective: Managing complex psychiatric disorders like **PTSD** and **bipolar** disorder is challenging in Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) delivering care to U.S residents living in underserved rural areas. This **protocol** paper describes SPIRIT, a pragmatic comparative effectiveness trial **design**ed to compare two approaches to manag**ing **PTSD **and bip**olar disorder in FQHCs. Interventions: Treatment comparators are: 1) Telepsychiatry Collaborative Care, which integrates consulting telepsychiatrists into primary care teams, and 2) Telepsychiatry Enhanced Referral, where telepsychiatrists and telepsychologists treat patients directly. Methods: Because Telepsychiatry Enhanced Referral is an adaptive intervention, a Sequential, Multiple Assignment, Randomized Tr**ial de**sign is used. Twenty-four FQHC clinics without on-site psychiatrists or psychologists are participating in the trial. The sample is patients screening posit**ive **for PTSD** and/or** **bipolar disord**er who are not already engaged in pharmacotherapy with a mental health specialist. Intervention fidelity is measured but not controlled. Patient treatment engagement is measured but not required, and intent-to-treat analysis will be used. Survey questions measure treatment engagement and effectiveness. The Short-Form 12 Mental Health Component Summary (SF-12 MCS) is the primary outcome. Results: A third (34%) of those enrolled (n = 1004) are racial/ethnic minorities, 81% are not fully employed, 68% are Medicaid enrollees, 7% are uninsured, and 62% live in poverty. Mental health related quality of **life** (SF-12 MCS) is 2.5 **standard** deviations below the national mean. **Discuss**ion: We hypothesize that patients randomized to Telepsychiatry Collaborative Care will have better outcomes than those randomized to Telepsychiatry Enhanced Referral because a higher proportion will engage in evidence-based treatment.  2019 eid: 2-s2.0-85078769514
1. **Online psycho-education to the treatment of bipolar disorder: Protocol of a randomized controlled trial**
Background: **Bipolar** disorder patients frequently present recurrent episodes and often experience subsyndromal symptoms, cognitive impairment and difficulties in functioning, with a low quality of **life**, illness relapses and recurrent hospitalization. Early diagnosis and appropriate intervention may play a role in preventing neuroprogression in this disorder. New technologies represent an opportunity to develop **standard**ized psychological treatments using internet-based tools that overcome some of the limitations of face-to-face treatments, in that they are readily accessible and the timing of therapy can be tailored to user needs and availability. However, although many psychological programs are offered through the web and mobile devices **for bip**olar disorder, there is a lack of high quality evidence concerning their efficacy and effectiveness due to the great variability in measures and methodology used. Methods: This clinical trial is a simple-blind randomized trial within a European project to compare an internet-based intervention with treatment as** usual.** **Bipolar disord**er patients are to be included and randomly assigned to one of two groups: 1) the experimental group (tele-care support) and 2) the control group. Participants in both groups will be evaluated at baseline (pre-treatment) and post-treatment. **Discuss**ion: This study describes the **design** of a clinical trial based on psychoeducation intervention that may have a significant impact on both prognosis and t**reatmen**t** in bipolar di**sorder. Specifically, bringing different services together (service aggregation), it is hoped that the approach proposed will significantly increase the impact of information and communication technologies on access and adherence to treatment, quality of the service, patient safety, patient and professional satisfaction, and quality** of **life of patients.

2. **Bipolar disorder and PTSD screening and telepsychiatry diagnoses in primary care**
Objective: To describe clinical diagnoses from telepsychiatrist consultation in safety net primary care settings for adult patients screening positive for **bipolar** disorder, **PTSD**, or both. Methods: Patients were administered **the **PTSD Checklist (PCL-6) and the Composite International Diagnostic Interview 3.0 (CIDI) **for bip**olar disorder. Positive screening result definitions were PCL-6 score of 14 and CIDI positive stem question responses and score of 8. Patient characteristics were assessed by survey. Psychiatrists consulted in primary care via telehealth and recorded clinical diagnoses. Results: Among 767 patients attending consultation with a telepsychiatrist, 495 (65%) screened PCL-6 positive only, 249 (32%) screened both PCL-6 and CIDI positive, and 23 (3%) screened CIDI positive. Approximately two-thirds screening PCL-6 positive were diagnos**ed w**ith PTSD, and most had comorbid mood disorder diagnose**s, with** **bipolar disord**er diagnosis occurring more often in those screening CIDI positive compared to negative (42% vs. 15%). Positive predictive values were 64.9% for PCL-6 and 43.8% for CIDI. Conclusion: Most individuals screening pos**itiv**e for **PTSD an**d**/or bipolar di**sorder had two or more psychiatric diagnoses; misclassification exists for both instruments but was greater for CIDI. Psychiatrist consultation early in treatment for individuals screening positive on the PCL-6 and/or CIDI could help clarify diagnoses and improve treatment planning.  2020 The Authors eid: 2-s2.0-85084993436

This review article presents existing research describing how information technologies can be used to improve mental health services for trauma survivors, either by enhancing existing treatment approaches or as a stand-alone means of delivering trauma-relevant interventions. The potential ways in which technology aids in overcoming barriers to care are first addressed in terms of providing mental health treatment. The use of technologies enables shifting the locus of care from the traditional provider's office to mobile, online, and virtual environments which are less threatening for patients with post-traumatic **stress** disorder (**PTSD**), helping to overcome the core nature of the illness which includes avoidance and increased personal isolation.

1. **EPA guidance on eMental health interventions in the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)**
The aim of this EPA guidance was to develop recommendations on eMental health interventions in the treatment of **posttraumat**ic **stress** disorder (**PTSD**). A systematic literature search was performed and 40 articles were retrieved and assessed with regard to study characteristics, applied technologies, therapeutic approaches, diagnostic ascertainment, efficacy, sustainability of clinical effects, practicability and acceptance, attrition rates, safety, clinician-supported vs. non-supported interventions and active vs. waiting-list controls. The reviewed studies showed a great heterogeneity concerning study type, study samples, interventions and outcome measures. Based on these findings, five graded recommendations dealing with symptom reduction, acceptability, type of administration, clinician support, self-efficacy and coping were developed.  2017 Elsevier Masson SAS eid: 2-s2.0-85013750745
2. **Risperidone for post-traumatic combat nightmares: A report of four cases**
OBJECTIVE: To report the response to low-dose risperidone in individuals with **combat**-related post-traumatic **stress** disorder (**PTSD****) co**mbat nightmares. DESIGN: Case series. SETTING: **Veteran**s Affairs Medical Center Mental Health Clinic and collaborative VA-U.S. Army Fort Bragg Warrior Transition Telepsychiatry Clinic. PRACTICE DESCRIPTI**ON: Vet**erans at the VA; soldiers that have severe medical and mental health problems in the Warrior Transition Telepsychiatry Clinic. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): No response: no change in frequency and/or severity of nightmares; partial response: decrease in frequency and/or severity of nightmares; full response: total cessation of recall of nightmares. RESULTS: The four individuals included one active duty soldier an**d three** veterans, ranging from 40 to 76 years of age. All served in the infantry, each in a di**fferen**t combat theater. Two participants had a reduction in the frequency and severity of nightmares at risperidone 1 mg at** night.** One veteran with blood alcohol levels greater than 300 mg/mL had a partial response with risperidone 3 mg at night. Without active substance abuse, the four individuals had a total cessation of nightmares the first night at a risperidone dose of 2 mg at night. The total cessation of nightmares with risperidone continued despite changes in concurrent anti**depress**ants, anxiolytics, and hypnotics. No medication side effects were reported. CONCLUSION: The use of low-dose risperidone (1-3 mg) at night can reduce the severity and frequency or stop the recall**** of ****PTSD combat nig**htmares** in some veterans and active duty soldiers. Risperidone may be an effective** medic**ation for combat nightm**ares** of PTSD and merits additional exploration.  2011 American Society of Consultant Pharmacists, Inc.

3. **Utilizing telehealth to support treatment of acute stress disorder in a theater of war: Prolonged exposure via clinical videoconferencing**
Background: **Posttraumat**ic **stress** disorder (**PTSD**) and ac**ute st**ress disorder are prevalent mental health diagnoses associated with the military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan and are especially significant in service members returning from **combat**. Prolonged exposure (PE) therapy is a highly effective behavioral treatment for these symptoms, and providing this treatment as soon as possible, even in the midst of a soldie**r's co**mbat deployment, has strong potential benefits. Materials and Methods: In the current case study, telehealth technology was used to support the delivery of PE therapy to treat a service member diagnosed wit**h acut**e stress disorder in a war zone. PE was conducted face-to-face on the relatively secure Forward Operating Base for the first half of therapy and via clinical videoconferencing (CV) to the service member's** remot**e combat outpost during the later stages of therapy. The service member exhibited marked improvements in symptoms over 10 sessions. Results: Results are consistent with previous empirical findings and highlight the potential benefits of using telehealth to deliver evidenced-based treatment fo**r trau**matic stress disorders in a war zone. This case study provides a preliminary working model for deliver**ing PE** in a combat environment using multiple delivery systems. Conclusions: Benefits and clinical utility of CV-delivered exposure therapy are discussed, particularly for providers pending future operational deployments (e.g., including members of the military, independent government agencies, and first responders) and for those treating patients in remote locations.

4. **Posttraumatic stress disorder treatment for operation enduring freedom/operation iraqi freedom combat veterans through a civilian community-based telemedicine network**
Background: Telemedicine holds great potential to improve access to care and to reduce barriers to treatment for military populations with **posttraumat**ic **stress** disorder (**PTSD**). This study sought to integrate the use of telemedicine mental health treatment services by a community healthcare provider to military populations residing in a rural location and to compare the equivalency of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) administered via telemedicine and traditional face-to-face therapy. Subjects and Methods: Study subjects were men or women 18 years of age or older who had served in Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and/or Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and were diagnosed w**ith **PTSD. The 18 study subjects were randomized and provided 10 weekly therapy sessions of CBT. Pre- and post-intervention assessments were conducted using the Clinician Admin**iste**red PTSD Scale (CAPS), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), Montgomery-Asberg **Depress**ion Rating Scale (MADRS), Life Events Checklist, and SF-36v2 (QualityMetric, Lincoln, RI) Health Survey. Results: The CAPS, HAM-A, and MADRS each demonstrated lower scores, signifying improvement, and 69% of subjects experienced a clinically significant change in the CAPS. Patient satisfaction results indicated greater satisfaction for telemedicine as opposed to traditional face-to-face treatment. Conclusions: Findings reveal a trend expressing the equivalence of telemedicine and face-to-face therapy when treating OEF/OIF ve**tera**ns with PTSD among rural populations by a community provider. It further demonstrates the successful collaboration between a community healthcare provider and the military healthcare system. Copyright  2014, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-84900027015
5. **Telepsychology for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder: A systematic review**
The effectiveness of psychological services provided remotely, telepsychology, for the management of **Posttraumat**ic **Stress** Disorder (**PTSD**) was evaluated. Eleven studies (n = 472 participants) were identified from electronic database searches. Study quality was assessed, with studies characterised by small and underpowered samples. Effect sizes and associated confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to determine the direction and magnitude of treatment change. Short-term treatment gains were reported for internet and video-based interventions. This included significant medium to large improvements (d range = 0.663.22) in cognitive and behavioural symptoms of **depress**ion, generalised anxiety and posttrauma**tic st**ress. However, the equivalence of telepsychology and face-to-face psychotherapy could not be determined, with few comparative studies available. Both treatment gains and deterioration were noted 1 to 6 months following treatment cessation, although this was based on limited follow-up data. Further larger scale and longitudinal research will help to ascertain the minimum requirements for the management and treatment** of **PTSD in a technology-supported environment.  2015,  The Author(s) 2015. eid: 2-s2.0-84936874287
6. **Are Community Studies of Psychological Trauma's Impact Accurate? A Study Among Jews and Palestinians**
We evaluated the accuracy of **posttraumat**ic **stress** disorder (**PTSD**) and major **depress**ion (MD) diagnoses using brief assessment instruments conducted by pho**ne. **PTSD and MD were assessed by telephone interview in a randomly selected sample of Jewish and Palestinian residents of Jerusalem (N = 150) during a period of marked threat of terrorism and war. We utili**zed **the PTSD Symptom Scale Interview Format (Foa, Riggs, Dancu, & Rothbaum, 1993) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9; Kroenke, Spitzer, & Williams, 2001). We then conducted in-depth, in-person interviews within 2 weeks**, as**sessing PTSD and MD using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI; Kessler et al., 2004). Th**e pr**evalence of PTSD and MD diagnosis ascertained by the 2 assessment modalities was similar. Indices of classification accuracy for the phone interview, using the in-person interview as the standard, ranged from modest to high. Brief phone and in-depth in**-per**son measures of PTSD and MD also correlated similarly with other demograph**ic, st**ress, and coping factors, suggesting convergent validity. Brief phone interviews appear useful for estimating the prevalence of psychological disorders in mass casualty contexts and may have a critical role in both epidemiologic work and guiding public health interventions.  2011 American Psychological Association. eid: 2-s2.0-80052649535
7. **Randomized controlled equivalence trial comparing videoconference and in person delivery of cognitive processing therapy for PTSD**
Introduction: In an effort to improve access to and utilization of health care, the **Veteran**s Health Administration (VHA) continues to investigate the effectiveness of video-teleconferencing (VTC) technologies for service delivery. While previous research focused on the efficacy of VTC treatment for post-traumatic **stress** disorder (**PTSD**) in Vietnam **era vet**erans, few studies have evaluated the efficacy of this modality and treatment for the Iraq/Afghanis**tan era** veterans. The aim of this randomized clinical trial was to evaluate equivalence between in person and VTC psychotherapy **for **PTSD in this newer cohor**t. Meth**ods: Veterans of the Iraq/Afghanistan conflict from two VHA hospitals in the United States were recruited and randomized to receive cognitive processing therapy (C**PT) **for PTSD either in person (IP) or over VTC. Clinician-administered and self-report measures were collected before, during, and after treatment. Results: A trend was observed which suggested that CPT over VTC may be equivalent to the treatment delivered in person, as suggested by previous studies. Regardles**s of tr**eatment, veterans who received the intervention in both conditions reported significant decreases on post-treatment measures. Discussion: This study highlighted research and clinical challenges in providing ser**vices t**o the newest veteran generation in general as well as unique challenges with VTC. One complicating factor to the statistical power of this study was a treatment dropout rate twice the original estimate. Factors that could have influenced this high dropout rate are explored.  2015,  The Author(s) 2015. eid: 2-s2.0-84971468403
8. **Pilot Assessment and Survey of Syrian Refugees' Psychological Stress and Openness to Referral for Telepsychiatry (PASSPORT Study)**
Background: Given the scarcity of mental health resources available for refugees in areas of conflict, it is imperative to investigate interventions that would be accepted by the refugees. Materials and Methods: In this study we surveyed 354 Syrian refugees using the HAD**Stress** screening tool and asked about their openness to referral to psychiatry and telepsychiatry. Results: Of the surveyed sample, 41.8% had scores on** HADSt**ress that correlate to posttr**aumati**c stress disorder. However, only 34% of the whole sample reported a perceived need to see a psychiatrist, and of those only 45% were open to telepsychiatry. Conclusions: Women, those who were bilingual, and those with **positi**ve HADStress status were less likely to accept telepsychiatry; however, this finding did not reach statistical significance. This study reports a partial acceptance of Syrian refugees for telepsychiatric services despite the high prevalence o**f psyc**hological stress.

9. **Telemedicine: A cost-reducing means of delivering psychotherapy to rural combat veterans with PTSD**
Background: Although effective psychotherapies for **posttraumat**ic **stress** disorder (**PTSD**) exist, high percentages of **Veteran**s in need of services are unable to access them. One particular challenge to providing cost-effective psychological treatments** to Vet**erans w**ith **PTSD involves the difficulty and high cost of delivering in-person, specialized psychothe**rapy to** Veterans residing in geographically remote locations. The delivery of these services via clinical videoteleconferencing (CVT) has been presented as a potential solution to this access to care problem. Materials and Methods: This study is a retrospective cost analysis of a randomized controlled trial investigating telemedicine service delivery of an anger management therapy for Vetera**ns w**ith PTSD. The parent trial found that the CVT condition provided clinical results that were comparable to the in-person condition. Several cost outcomes were calculated in order to investigate the clinical and cost outcomes associated with the CVT delivery modality relative to in-person delivery. Results: The CVT condition was significantly associated with lower total costs compared with the in-person delivery condition. The delivery of mental health services via **CVT ena**bles Veterans who would not normally receive these services access to empirically based treatments. Additional studies addressing long-term healthcare system costs, indirect cost factors at the patient and societal levels, and the use of CVT in other geographic regions of the United States are needed. Conclusions: The results of this study provide evidence that CVT is a cost-reducing mode of service delivery to Ve**tera**ns with PTSD relative to in-person delivery.

10. **BEHAVIORAL ACTIVATION and THERAPEUTIC EXPOSURE for POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER: A NONINFERIORITY TRIAL of TREATMENT DELIVERED in PERSON VERSUS HOME-BASED TELEHEALTH**
Objective **Combat** **veteran**s returning to society with impairing mental health conditions such as **PTSD** and major **depress**ion (MD) report significant barriers to care related to aspects of traditional psychotherapy service delivery (e.g., stigma, travel time, and cost). Hence, alternate treatment delivery methods are needed. Home-based telehealth (HBT) is one such option; however, this delivery mode has not been compared to in person, clinic-based care **for **PTSD in adequately powered trials. The present study was designed to compare relative noninferiority of evidence-based psychotherap**ies **for PTSD and MD, specifically Behavioral Activation and Therapeutic Exposure (BA-TE), when delivered via HBT versus in person, in clinic delivery. Method A repeated measures (i.e., baseline, posttreatment, 3-, 6-month follow-up) randomized controlled design powered for noninferiority analyses was used** to **compare PTSD and MD symptom improvement in response to BA-TE delivered via HBT versus in person, in clinic conditions. Participants were **232 vet**erans diagnosed with full criteria or predefin**ed s**ubthre**shol**d PTSD. Results PTSD and MD symptom improvement following BA-TE delivered by HBT was comparable to that of BA-TE delivered in person at posttreatment and at 3- and 12-month follow-up. Conclusion Evidence-**base**d psychotherapy for PTSD **and dep**ression can be safely and effectively delivered via HBT with clinical outcomes paralleling those of clinic-based care delivered in person. HBT, thereby, addresses barriers to care related to both logistics and stigma.  2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-84964643214
11. **Therapist adherence and competence with manualized cognitive-behavioral therapy for PTSD delivered via videoconferencing technology**
Using secondary analyses from a randomized trial comparing the effectiveness of manualized cognitive-behavioral therapy for **posttraumat**ic **stress** disorder, we compared ratings of therapist competency and adherence between two service delivery modes: telepsychiatry (TP) and same room (SR). Patients were 38 male treatment-seeking **veteran**s recruited fro**m a vet**erans affairs medical center. Domains of therapist competence and adherence included structuring sessions, implementing session activities, providing feedback, dealing with difficulties, developing rapport, and conveying empathy. Only one difference emerged between the two treatment conditions, with more favorable ratings on this item in the TP condition. Findings suggest that therapist competence and adherence to cognitive-behavioral therapy is similar whether the treatment is delivered via TP or by traditional means, and TP does not compromise therapists' ability to effectively structure sessions or build rapport with patients. These data further support the use of TP to address shortages in access to mental health care.  2007 Sage Publications. eid: 2-s2.0-34848840294
12. **Effectiveness of cognitive behavioural therapy administered by videoconference for posttraumatic stress disorder**
Telehealth, or health care via videoconferencing, constitutes a clinical option that makes it possible to treat patients remotely. A growing number of studies have demonstrated that telehealth is a feasible and effective method for diagnostic interviews and psychiatric consultations. However, few studies have assessed the effectiveness of psychotherapy given by videoconference. This study examines the effectiveness of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) administered by videoconference for **posttraumat**ic **stress** disorder (**PTSD**). Forty-eight participants w**ith **PTSD were recruited for the study: 16 in the videoconferencing condition and 32 in a control face-to-face condition. Each participant received CBT for 16 to 25 weeks and completed various questionnaires before and after treatment. The results show a significant decline in the frequency and severity** of posttra**umatic symptoms after treatment in both conditions. A clinical improvement in overall functioning was also observed. No significant difference was observed in the effectiveness of the two therapeutic conditions. The examination of effect sizes supports these results. A number of clinical implications and certain avenues for future research are discussed. eid: 2-s2.0-61549135353
13. **Telepsychiatry- based care for the treatment follow-up of iranian war veterans with post- traumatic stress disorder: A randomized controlled trial**
Background: Physical limitations, distance, and time are major obstacles to access to mental health services for **veteran**s and soldiers. This study was aimed at comparing the efficacy of telepsychiatry and face-to-face consultation as methods of treating post-traumatic **stress** disorder (**PTSD**). The comparison was based on treatment costs, access to health services, completion of therapy sessions, and patient satisfaction as variables. Methods: This research was a double blinded clinical trial supported by Tabriz University of Medical Sciences and conducted in 2015 to 2016 in Tabriz, Iran. Totally, 60 patients were included in the study. Through simple randomization, the patients were divided into experimental and control groups, both of whom were treated through face-to-face consultations for the first 3 sessions. Six follow-up sessions were then held remotely with the experimental group and face to face with the control group. Data were collected using a self-designed and reliable questionnaire and entered in SPSS, version 16. Intergroup comparisons were performed using descriptive statistical measures. Finally, the results were tested using the t test method. Results: A significant relationship was found between the use of information technology and increased patient satisfaction, completion of therapy sessions, and reduction in treatment costs; however, no significant difference was found between the groups in terms of reduction in waiting time and access to a psychiatrist. Conclusion: Telepsychiatry is an effective means of delivering mental health services to psychiatric outpatients living in remote areas with limited resources. The results provide preliminary support for the use of telepsychiatry in treat**ing **PTSD and improving access to care.  2019, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences.

14. **Early treatment withdrawal from evidence-based psychotherapy for PTSD: Telemedicine and in-person parameters**
Objective: To determine differences in reported barriers to treatment completion associated with telemedicine vs. in-person delivery of evidence-based treatment for **PTSD** in **combat** **veteran**s. Method: The present study was derived from two ongoing randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing in-person vs. telemedicine delivery of exposure therapy **for **PTSD. A onetime telephone assessment of participants who dropped out from the treatment phase of these two studies was conducted, with measures focusing on reported reasons for dropout, and perceived comfort and efficacy of the treatment modality. Dichotomous data were analyzed via chi-square and logistic regression; continuous data via ANOVA. Results: Forty-seven of 69 total dropouts participated. There was no difference in rate of dropout between modalities. A greater proportion of participants receiving in-person exposure therapy reported difficulties with logistical aspects of care (e.g., parking), whereas a greater proportion of participants receiving telemedicine therapy reported difficulty tolerating certain **stress**ful aspects of treatment; however, those receiving telemedicine delivered treatment completed more sessions before dropping out. Participants in both conditions reported that they liked and were confident in their therapist Conclusions: Dropout reasons varied according to type of treatment delivery. Recommendations for future research are given in terms of modification of treatment protocol according to delivery modality.  2014, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-84988260168

**High** quality health services for psychiatric emergencies are difficult to maintain 24h a day in sparsely populated areas, where the availability of specialists are **limit**ed. To overcome this challenge, the University Hospital of North Norway implemented an on-call system in psychiatric emergencies, by which psychiatrists are accessible 24/7 for telephone and **videoconferenc**ing consultations with patients and nurses at three regional psychiatric centers. The purpose of this study was to explore the usefulness** of videoconfe**rencing consultations in psychiatric emergencies. The on-call psychiatrists and nurses at the regional psychiatric centers who participated in at le**ast one videoc**onferencing consultation were recruited for semi-structured interviews: 5 psychiatrists and 19 nurses for a total of 24 participants. The interviews were performed from July of 2012 to **June** of 2013. The interviews were transcribed and analyzed using a stepwise-deductive-inductive approach supported by the HyperRESEARCH analysis software. After the introduc**tion of the vi**deoconferencing system, telephone consultations were still used for straightforward situations when further treatment or admission decision**s were obvious**. Videoconferencing consultations, during which patients were present, were useful for challenging situations when there was 1) uncertainty regarding the degree of illness or the level of treatment, 2) a need to clarify the severity of the patient condition, 3) a need to build an **allianc**e with the patient, and 4) disagreement either between health personnel or between the patient an**d health perso**nnel. Videoconferencing is useful for challenging and complex psychiatric emergencies and is a suitable tool for build**ing **high quality, decentralized psychiatric services.  2017, The Author(s). eid: 2-s2.0-85047478559
1. **Telepsychology in Australia: 2020 vision**
The current roll-out of broadband across **Australia** provides new opportunities for psychologists to reach out to residents in **remot**e and **rural** areas. With the advent of internet protocol (IP)-based **videoconferenc**ing, telepsychology is becoming more accessible and affordable, and a potential solution to those** in r**emote areas who require access to specialist assessment and psychotherapy services. Telepsychology represents a **high**-quality/low-cost model of service delivery. Findings to date suggest that **outcom**e might be equivalent to in-person therapy across a range of client groups both using standardised assessments and evidence-based therapies. Studies have consistently shown that clients r**ate **high levels of satisfaction and **therapeut**ic rapport. However, uptake among psychologists has been slow. This article provides a synthesis of the gradual growth of telepsychology** in Austr**alia. It identifies factors that hinder the development of telepsychology and outlines the main arguments for developing this as a model for the provision of psychology** acro**ss remote **and **r**ural A**ustralia.

2. **Therapeutic alliance in videoconferencing psychotherapy: A review**
Psychotherapy services are **limit**ed in **remot**e and **rural** areas in **Australia** and across the globe. **Videoconferenc**ing has become well established as a feasible and acceptable mode of psychological treatment delivery. **Therapeut**ic **allianc**e (TA) is an essential factor underlying successful therapy acr**oss thera**peutic models. In order to determine the state of knowledge regarding TA in psychotherapy **via videoconfe**rencing, a literature review was conducted on research studies that formally measured TA as primary, secondary or tertiary **outcom**e measures over the past 23 years. The databases searched were Medline, PsycArticles, PsycINFO, PsycEXTRA and EMBASE. Searching identified 9915 articles that measured satisfaction, acceptabi**lity or t**herapeutic rapport, of which 23 met criteria for the review. Three studies were carried out** in Austr**alia, 11 in USA, 4 in Canada, 3 in Scotland and 2 in England. Studies overwhelmingly supported the notion that TA can be developed in psychothe**rapy by videoc**onference, with clients rating bond and presence at least equally as strongly as in-person settings across a range of diagnostic groups. Therapists also rated **high** levels of TA, but often not quite** as **high as that of their clients early in treatment. The evidence was examined in the context of important aspects of TA, including bond, presence, therapist attitudes and abilities, and client attitudes and beliefs. Barriers and facilitators** of all**iance were identified. Future studies should include observational measures of bond and presence to supplement self-report.  2014 Natio**nal R**ural** Health** Alliance Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-84916242832

Most college counseling centers do not utilize telehealth despite evidence of positive **outcom**es. The aim of this study was to examine the telehealth experience of students in a college counseling center. Participants were health professional students who utilized at least one telehealth visit between November 2015 and April 2017 (N=67). Methods: In **June** 2017, the authors administered a telehealth survey that assessed access, experience, effectiveness, and impact on **therapeut**ic **allianc**e. Of 67 students, 36 (53.7%) responded. The majority reported telehealth was convenient (34, 94.4%), time-saving (34, 94.4%), and helped them to feel better (30, 83.3%). Over half used telehealth because of distance (20, 55.5%). Eighty-one percent reported telehealth as being as good, nearly as good, or no different than meeting in person. Conclusion: Telehealth is a viable option for college counseling centers and is experienced as convenient, time-saving, and effective with little negative impact on therapeu**tic all**iance.  2018,  2018 Taylor & Francis. eid: 2-s2.0-85052063325

0. **Exploring the Telepsychiatry Experience: Primary Care Provider Perception of the Michigan Child Collaborative Care (MC3) Program**
Background: **Pediatr**ic mental healthcare is a growing component of primary care practice. However, there is a lack of access to mental health services, particularly those provided by **Child** and **Adolesc**ent Psychiatrists. The Michi**gan C**hild Collaborative Care (MC3) Program is a telepsychiatry service that offers embedded behavioral health consultants within primary care practices, telephonic consultation, video consultation and embedded care. Primary care provider (**PCP**) **util**ization of telepsychiatry services is predicated on perceiving the consultation service as user-friendly, helpful, and feasible in their practice. Objective: A survey** of** PCPs was conducted over a 5-year period to** as**sess PCP attitudes and perceptions regarding MC3 consultation, including measures of efficiency, user-friendliness, and confidence in providing mental healthcare. The survey contained 4 items, (2 quantitative and 2 qualitative), and took less than 2 minutes to complete. Results: 649 responses were received out of 1475 possible responses (44% response rate). Common themes elicited from the qualitative items included perception of improved patient care for **youth** with mental illness (45.3%), improved comfort and confidence in caring **for y**outh with mental illness (30.9%), greater comfort with the prescribing and monitoring of psychotropics (25.9%) and improved access to mental healthcare for you**th **(23.1%). PCPs strongly agreed that MC3 was user-friendly, efficient, and enhanced their confidence in manag**ing ped**iatric mental health concerns. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that the MC3 Telepsychiatry Program is w**ell** accepted by PCPs with self-reported improvements in providing mental healthcare to patients. Future research** sh**ould explore how** PC**P perception impacts PCP practice, knowledge, as well as outcomes for patients and families longitudinally.  2018 Academy of Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry eid: 2-s2.0-85051084783
1. **Evolution of telepsychiatry to rural sites: changes over time in types of referral and in primary care providers' knowledge, skills and satisfaction**
Introduction: **Rural** populations remain underserved in terms of psychiatric services. This study assesses changes over time in the **util**ization of telepsychiatric services by individual primary care providers (**PCP**s) and clinics** in r**ural areas, specifically: (a) types of **referr**als for telepsychiatry service; **(b)** PCPs' knowledge and skills related to medication dosing; **and** (c) PCPs' **satisfact**ion with telepsychiatry. Methods: Data with regard to patient demographics, diagnoses, reason for consultation, medication dosing **and satis**faction were prospectively collected on the first 200 and the subsequent 200 telepsychiatric initial consultations. A number of educational interventions were implemented during the project. Results: Adult patients were primar**ily re**ferred for mood and anxiety disorders, particularly for diagnosis and medication treatment planning.** Ov**er time, PCPs significantly improved medication dosing and asked for more treatment** pl**anning help**. PCPs' s**atisfaction also improved over time. Discussion: Telepsychiatric consultation, in combination with specific educational interventions, appears to facilitate the enhancement of skil**ls **and knowledge of PCPs. "Developmental" steps in provider and clinic evolution, along with interventions specific to a given provider's and a given site's needs, ought to be further elucidated.  2006 Elsevier Inc.

Access to psychiatric care for **child**ren and **adolesc**ents is limited outside of urban areas. Telepsychiatry provides one mechanism to bring needed services to **youth**. This investigation examines whether telepsychiatry could be successful in providing needed services. Using interactive video teleconferencing at 384 kilobits per second, psychiatrists based at a regio**nal c**hildren's hospital provided consultation and management services to patients at 4 sites across Washington State located 75-150 miles f**rom t**he children's hospital. Twelve-month review of billing records provided **util**ization data. Surveys of parents' **satisfact**ion over 12 months examined whether parents would accept and be satisfied with the care render**ed to** their children. Over the study year, 387 telepsychiatry visits were provided to **172 y**outh 2-21 years old with a mean of 2.25 visits per patient. The demographic and diagnostic profile of this sample was consistent with usual outpatient mental health samples. Parents endorsed high satisfac**tion **with their children's telepsychiatric care, with an indication of increas**ing satis**faction upon return appointments. Parents demonstrated some diffe**rential s**atisfaction, tendin**g to high**er satisfaction wit**h the**ir school-aged children's** care and** lower satisfaction with th**eir ado**lescents' care. Telepsychiatry off**ered **through a regional children's hospital was w**ell **utilized and parents were **highl**y satisfied with their children's care.

Methods: A mixed methods approach was used. This included an online survey completed by** 43** PCPs in Ontario **rural** communities who **had re**ferred patients to the telemental health program. Qualitative interviews were conducted with** 11 c**hild/**adolesc**ent telepsychiatrists who provide consultations via teleconferencing. Results: The majo**rit**y of PCPs (61%) reported somewhat to moderate **satisfact**i**on wit**h referral experiences. Challenges identified by physicians were related to communication and administration issues including: lack of timely follow-up appointments and continuity of ca**re; le**ngthy referral forms; and recommendations for mental health services not accessible in their communities. Similarly, psychiatrist consultants expressed frustration with the sparse information the**y rece**ived from referring physicians and most significantly, the absence of appropriate service providers/professionals during the consultation to provide collateral information and ensure uptake of recommendations. Conclusion: Telemental health programs provide a valuable** se**rvice to PCPs an**d the**ir child and **youth** clients that could be significantly enhanced with a different consultation model. Such models of service delivery require proto**col**s to educate PCPs, improve communication and information sharing and establish clear e**xpe**ctations between PCPs and telepsychiatry consultants.  2019, Canadian** Acad**emy of Child **and Ado**lescent Psychiatry.

Background: In line with the wider trend of offering **support** via the Internet, many **counsel**ing and referral services for **child**ren have introduced online chat, often in addition to a **tradit**ional **telephon**e service. Methods: A comparative study was conducted between **the tele**phone service and the confidential one-on-one online chat service of the Dutch Kindertelefoon. The design included a concise pretest and a posttest (n = 902). The study also comprised a follow-up test (n = 213), which included the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Resul**ts: C**hildren experienced a higher sense of well-being and a reduced severity of their problems after consulting the Kindertelefoon. The results were slightly more favorable for the chat service than **for the **telephone service. The follow-up survey showed that many** of t**he children who contact the Kindertelefoon suffer from relatively severe emotional problems. Conclusion**s: Both **the telephone and the web-ba**sed sup**port i**mprov**ed the children's well-being and decreased their perceived burden of problem. The results of this study underline the need for closer coop**erati**on between child helplines an**d men**tal health and child welfare services**.  20**09 Association for Child and **Adolesc**ent Mental Health. eid: 2-s2.0-70349564761
1. **Using technology to deliver mental health services to children and youth: A scoping review**
Objective: To conduct a scoping review on the use of technology to deliver mental health services to **child**ren and **youth** in order to identify the breadth of peer-reviewed literature, summarize findings and identify gaps. Method: A literature database search identified 126 original studies meeting criteria for review. Descriptive numerical summary and thematic analyses were conducted. Two reviewers independently extracted data. Results: Studies were characterized by diverse technologies including videoconferencing, **telephon**e and mobile phone applications and Internet-based applications such as email, web sites and CD-ROMs. Conclusion: The use of technologies plays a major role in the delivery of mental health services and **support**s** to c**hildren **and y**outh in providing prevention, assessment, diagnosis, **counsel**ing and treatment programs. Strategies are growing exponentially on a global basis, thus it is critical to study the impact of these technolo**gies **on ch**ild a**nd youth mental health service delivery. An in-depth review and synthesis of the quality of fndings of studies on effectiveness of the use of technologies in service delivery are also warranted. A full systematic review would provide that opportunity.  Canadian** Acad**emy of Child and **Adolesc**ent Psychiatry. eid: 2-s2.0-84900805289
2. **Study protocol: A randomised controlled trial of a telephone delivered social wellbeing and engaged living (SWEL) psychological intervention for disengaged youth**
Background: Internationally, from 12.2-23.4% of **youth** (aged 16-24 years) are not in employment, education or training (NEET). These disenga**ged y**outh are more likely to experience social exclusion, increased psychological distress and poor quality o**f lif**e. Youth at risk of disengagement are less likely to access **tradit**ional **support** services, requiring development of innovative interventions. Methods: The trial is a single blind, three arm, randomised controlled trial evaluating the effectiveness of a **telephon**e delivered psychological intervention for** dise**ngaged youth (12-25 years). Participants will be randomised to receive either (i) SWEL, (ii) Befriending, or (iii) Single Session Psycho-Education. Therapy will be over an 8 week period with a minimum of four and maximum of eight sessions for the SWEL or Befriending conditions, or a single session for the Psycho-Education condition. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline and at 2, 8 and 14-month follow-up with the primary outcome being re-engagement in education, training or employment. Discussion: This large, multi-site, randomised controlled trial will inform the delivery of services for young people at risk of disengaging from education or training. The provision of psychological therapy** by tele**phone incr**eases** access by youth - especially those in rural and remote areas - both to the trial and the treatment, if adopted by services. The outcomes of this trial could have meaningful societal impact for a vulnerable population. It is expected that recruitment, intervention and retention will present challenges for the trial given the **focus** on disengaged youth. Trial registration: ANZCTR, ACTRN12614001212640, Registered 18 Nov 2014. Retrospectively registered. Ethics and dissemination: Ethics approval has been obtained from the participating institutions. Results of the trial will be submitted for publication in peer reviewed journals and findings presented at scientific conferences and to key service providers and policy makers.  2019 The Author(s). eid: 2-s2.0-85065641912

The prevalence of overweight and obesity is approximately 32% among **child**ren and **adolesc**ents in the United States. Comorbid conditions associated with pediatric overweight and obesity include psychiatric conditions. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of overweight and obesity am**ong c**hildren **and ado**lescents presenting for consultation from **rural** communities to the UC Davis Telemedicine Program (UCDTP), as well as to collect preliminary data to design an integrated disease management prog**ram f**or child**ren and** adolescents with obesity and mental illness. Patients aged 21 and under seen for psychiatric consultation at the UCDTP between 2004 and 2006 were included. Retrospective medical record review was conducted to determine the major psychiatric diagnoses, height, weight, body-mass index, and weight status (underweight/at risk for underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese) for each patient. Of the 230 patients referred, a total of 121 patients had both height and weight values documented. Three patients were underweight; 51 were normal weight; 28 were overweight; 39 were obese. The most common psychiatric diagnoses in the 121 patients were attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; n=40), bipolar disorder (n=36), and **depress**ion (n=31). The most common psychiatric diagnoses in patients with available weight and height data who were overweight and obese were bipolar disorder (n=2**0), dep**ression (n=18), and ADHD (n=17). Approxima**tely **55% o**f child** and adolescent patients seen for telepsychiatry consultation whose charts documented height and weight measurements were overweight or obese. Psychiatric diagnoses in overweight youngsters need to be researched further to determine whether the weight change is primary or secondary to mood and/or to treatments, such as medication. At such a high rate of comorbidity, monitoring the weight status of young psychiatric patients in this population is indicated.  2009, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-74249085171
1. **E-CYMHS: An expansion of a child and youth telepsychiatry model in Queensland**
Objectives: The purpose of this study was to describe the evolution of the E-**Child** and Youth **Mental Health Servic**e (E-CYMHS), which supports regional and **rura**l** mental health se**rvices by providing access to consult**ant c**hild and **adolesc**ent psychiatrists to isolated staff in regional areas, where access to specialist psychiatric services is limited. Conclusions: E-CYMHS provides a level of parity in mental health care between metropolitan, regional and remote services through the provision of regular videoconferencing servic**es wi**th child **and ado**lescent psychiatrists and senior allied health clinicians. The three key features which underpin the success of the service are: 1. A central co-ordinator of services; 2. Provision of support outside regular videoconference times; and 3. Routine outreach visits that foster community capacity-building. E-CYMHS has been well received by the r**egional mental healt**h services it supports, and the total provision of services has more than doubled over the last three years. It is anticipated that as telepsychiatry is increasingly viewed as a credible alternative to traditional means of patient care, this trend is likely to continue.  2012 The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists. eid: 2-s2.0-84872155638

3. **Establishing a telepsychiatry consultation practice in rural Georgia for primary care physicians: A feasibility report**
Objective. One approach to solving mental health care disparity issues in **rural** areas is by establishing a telepsychiatry consultation practice for **child**ren, in which a psychiatrist see**s a c**hild via videoconferencing for a limited number of sessions and then provides a treatment plan **to th**at child's primary care physician and family. Method. The present study offered a 2-session telepsychiatry consultation clinic, consisting of a psychiatric evaluation session and a recommendation session, with patients located remotely** in r**ural Georgia. Results. Fifteen consult**ation**s with children aged 4 to 18 years (M = 9.73, SD = 3.39) with varying diagnoses were completed. Parental satisfaction with the telepsychiatry consultation model was high, overall mean of 4.58 (SD = 0.63) on a 5-point scale (n = 11). Conclusion.** Esta**blishing a child telepsychiatry consultation practice is feas**ible **in rural areas.

4. **A statewide child telepsychiatry consult system yields desired health system changes and savings**
Background: Telepsychiatry has clinical efficacy with **child**ren, but questions remain about cost-effectiveness. State agencies and health systems need to know i**f a c**hild telepsychiatry consult system can address system concerns and improve care quality while lowering costs. Materials and Methods: To assist care in a **rural** state w**ith f**ew child and **adolesc**ent psychiatrists, an academic center coordinated a consult system of (1) televideo consults for** high**-needs children with Medicaid and state Multidisciplinary Team (MDT)/foster care involvement, (2) remote medication reviews for beyond guidelines prescribing, and (3) elective community provider telephone-based consults. Consult service data were collected and analyzed with Wyoming's Medicaid and Foster Care Divisions between the program start in January 2011 until March 2013. Results: There were 229 televideo MDT/foster care consults, 125 mandatory medication reviews, and 277 elective phone consultations supporting community providers during this period. Following implementation, the num**ber o**f Medicaid children 5 years of age using psychotropic medications decreased by 42% (p<0.001)**, and** the number of children using psychotropic doses >150% of the Food and Drug Administration maximum decreased by 52% (p<0.001). Televideo con**sults** redirected 60% of children slated by caseworkers for a psychiatric residential treatment facility admission into alternative community treatment and placements. A financial return on investment was 1.82 to 1 for combined services. Co**nclus**ions: This coordinated child telepsychiatry consult system for a state Medicaid division reduced outlier pediatric psychiatric medication prescribing, supported local community-delivered treatments, and reduced unnecessary hospitalizations in a financially advantageous manner that was well received by the practice community.  2015, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-84936936665
5. **Telepsychiatry assessments of child or adolescent behavior disorders: A review of evidence and issues**
Background: The limited number of mental health specialists for **child**ren has led to an increased need **for c**hild and **adolesc**ent psychiatrists to provide primary care consultations and treatment recommendations. Psychiatric assessments and treatments provided via two-way videoconferencing (telepsychiatry) have been used to increase the availabi**lity **of **child psychiatri**sts. This article reviews the **literatur**e on telepsychiatry as**sessm**ent of children **and ado**lescents. Methods: Research on telepsychiatry has focused on the comparability of telepsychiatric treatments to in-person treatment for adult patients. Relatively little research has addressed the ability of telepsychiatric assessments to facilitate favorable treatment outcomes, p**artic**ularly for c**hild or** adolescent patients. This wa**s a liter**ature search using Medline via Ovid. It focused on English-language material published between 1996 and 2009. A range of search terms relating to assessment, mental health**, tel**emedicine, and children was used. **Any s**tudies focusing o**n child** and adolescent psychiatric assessment were included. Results**: The** **limited l**iterature on children is usually related to project descriptions or case reports. The studies tend to find acceptance and the diagnoses and recommendations are not seen as different from in-person assessments. Practical considerations that arise in giving telepsychiatric assessments are discussed. Conclusion: Although there are significant weaknesses in the research justifying** tele**psychiatric assessments **in chil**dren and adolescents, there are no data that suggest that this process contributes to negative outcomes. Details on the setting for telepsychiatry assessments and camera view have not been studied.  2010, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-77956140102
6. **A child and adolescent psychiatric outreach service for rural New South Wales: A telemedicine pilot study**
Objective: To examine the feasibility of a tertiary outreach service in **child** and **adolesc**ent psychiatry to two **rural** health centres in New South Wales, Australia. Methods: Following a site visit to Dubbo Hospital and Bourke Hospital, telemedical videoconferencing was provided for 2 h/week for 32 weeks. Details of referrers, patients' diagnosis and outcome, and satisfaction with the service were obtained. Results: Cases were triaged by a nominated ru**ral ado**lescent mental health worker. The service provided detailed assessment and management of severe, complex, mental and neuropsychiatric disorders. Fifty-four young people were assessed and 72 joint consultative videoconferencing interviews were undertaken, including 26 initial consultations. Twenty-three initial consultations were undertaken on the visit to **the r**ural centres. Clinical descriptions illustrate the flexibility and sensitivity of the service. Conclusion: Telepsychiatry provides access to a flexible, effective tertiary service for those with special, complex needs, including the disadvantaged or isolated. It makes a valuable, economic contribution to supporting and ed**ucati**ng rural health professionals, thereb**y enr**iching rural **mental health servic**es. eid: 2-s2.0-0032702251
7. **The child and adolescent telepsychiatry consultation: Can it be a more effective clinical process for certain patients than conventional practice?**
The **literatur**e on the efficacy of telepsychiatry for assessing and treating **child**ren and **adolesc**ents with mental health problems is still developing, but there is evidence that telepsychiatry is diagnostically valid, and that there is high patient and provider satisfaction. Outcome studies are awaited, with the assumption that telepsychiatry has to demonstrate at least as good outcomes and reliability as face-to-face psychiatric care. In this article we suggest, by reviewing the process of telepsychiatry w**ith c**hildren, and illustrating relevant issues with five case studies of patients we have seen, that there is a valid case for arguing that in **certa**in children **and ado**lescents, telepsychiatry, as a consultation process, might actually be a superior method of psychiatric assessment to face-to-face consultation. Four factors stand out supporting this view. These are the novelty of the consultation, the capacity to provide direction, the extra distance involved (both psychological and physical), and the authenticity of the interaction. More **resea**rch in ch**ild and** adolescent telepsychiatry is indicated.  2010, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-77952403959
8. **Diffusion of efficacious interventions for children and adolescents with mental health problems**
Background: **Child** and **adolesc**ent mental health problems are prevalent and require adequate interventions. Despite several evidence-based interventions for these problems described in the **literatur**e, few studies addressed strategies to diffuse efficacious interventions **for c**hild mental disorders especially in developing countries. Methods: An extensive but not systematic review of **the liter**ature was performed aiming to identify evidence-based interventi**ons f**or children **and ado**lescents with mental disorders, professionals to target in disseminating these interventions, and the available strategies to diffuse information. Results: Substantial evidence-based information is available to guide preventive, psychosocial and psychopharmacological interventions. The effectiveness of treatments in real-world settings and the cost-effectiveness of interventions are rarely tested. Professionals at different levels (teachers, school counselors, social workers, general practitioners, ped**iatri**cians, child psychologists and psychiatrists) should be targeted in diffusing efficacious in**terve**ntions for child mental health problems worldwide. Telepsychiatry and the internet seem to be the most promising strategies to diffuse knowledge with lower costs. Conclusions: Medical and allied professiona**ls mu**st incorporate ch**ild and** adolescent mental health issues in their under- and postgraduate curricula, and be better prepared to critically evaluate available information. Professionals need to disseminate evidence-based programs to guide parents and teachers in developing** coun**tries to deal wit**h child** and adolescent difficulties. Countries need to explore internet solutions for dissemination of medical information.  2007 The Authors. eid: 2-s2.0-40449105030
9. **A retrospective analysis of a child and adolescent eMental health program**
OBJECTIVE: New models of psychiatric intervention are needed to improve the accessibility of mental health care in the primary care setting, particularly in **rural** areas of the United States and especially for **child**ren and **adolesc**ents. The aim of this study was to examine the diagnostic characteristics and outcomes **for c**hildren referred for eMental Health consultations at UC Davis (videoconferencing, telephone, and secure e-mail) from 10 primary care clinics** in r**ural northern California. METHOD: A retrospective analysis was conducted on the diagnostic and clinical outcomes of 139 r**eferr**ed children who received a full psychiatric diagnostic evaluation via videoconferencing. Within the group, a convenience sample of 58 initial and 41 three-mont**h fol**low-up Child Behavior Checklists (CBCLs) was collected. RESULTS: Comprehensive eMental Health programs appear to be effective for psychiatric diagnosis an**d ass**essment of children. Attention deficit (36.2%) and mood (28.1%) disorders were the most common diagnostic grou**pings** overall. Most children were seen only once, but a statistically significant improvement between initial evaluation and 3-month follow-up in the convenience sample was seen in the Affect and Oppositional domains of the CBCL for girls and boys, respectively.

This practice parameter discusses the use of telepsychiatry to provide services to **child**ren and **adolesc**ents. The parameter defines terms and reviews the status of telepsychiatry as a mode of health service delivery. Because many of the issues addressed are unique to telepsychiatry, the parameter presents principles for establishing a telepsychiatry service and optimizing clinical practice within that service. The principles presented are based on existing scientific evidence and clinical consensus. Telepsychiatry is still evolving, and this parameter represents a first approach to determining "best practices."

Background: Evaluation of telepsychiatry (via videoconference) for older adults is mostly focussed on nursing homes or **inpati**ents. We evaluated the role of a community based program for older adults in **rural** and remote regions of South Australia. Method: The utilization pattern was studied using retrospective chart review of telepsychiatry assessments over 24 months (2010-2011). Satisfaction was evaluated through prospective post-consultation feedback (using a 5-point Likert scale), from patients, community based clinicians and psychiatrist participating in consecutive assessments from April-November 2012. Descriptive analysis was used for the utilization. Mean scores and proportions were calculated for the feedback. Mann Whitney U test was used to compare patient subgroups based on age, gender, prior exposure to telepsychiatry services **and in**patient/ outpatient status. Feedback comments were analysed for emerging themes. Results: On retrospective review of 134 consults, mean age was 75.89 years (SD 7.55), 60.4% (81) were females, and 71.6% (96) lived independently. Patients had a broad range of psychiatric disorders, from mood disorders to **delirium** and dementia, with co-morbid medical illness in 83.5% (112). On feedback evaluation (N = 98), mean scores ranged from 3.88-4.41 for patients, 4.36-4.73 for clinicians and 3.67-4.45 for psychiatrists. Feedba**ck fro**m inpatients (14 out of 37) was significantly lower compared to outpatients (37 out of 61) (chi sq. = 0.808, p < 0.05), and they were significantly less satisfied with the wait time (U = 163.0, p < 0.05) and visual clarity (U = 160.5, p < 0.05). Audio clarity was the most **common** aspect of dissatisfaction (mean score less than 3) among patients (6, 11%). Psychiatrists reported a preference for telepsychiatry over face to face in 55.4% (46) assessments. However, they expressed discomfort in situations of cognitive or sensory disabilities in patients. Conclusions:** In r**ural and remote areas, community-based telepsychiatry program can be a useful adjunct for psychiatrist input in the care of older adults. Innovations to overcome sensory deficits and collaboration with community services should be explored to improve its acceptance among the most vulnerable population.  2018 The Author(s). eid: 2-s2.0-85054051128
1. **Telepsychiatry Consultation for Medical and Surgical Inpatient Units**
Background Telepsychiatry is becoming more **common**place in the provision of psychiatric care. M**ost co**mmonly used in the outpatient setting, there is little information available in the literature as to the use of telepsychiatry for **inpati**ent medical/surgical consultation. Objective We review the University of Pittsburgh Medical **Center**'s telepsychiatry consultation program that provides consultation to an outlying community-based **rural** hospital. Methods This article examines the 69 telepsychiatry consultations that were performed from November 2014 through February 2016, looking at the patients **served**, common consultation questions, and patterns of diagnoses and recommendations. Results The median age of individuals undergoing telepsychiatry evaluations was 67 years, a**nd the** most common reason for consultation was for **delirium**. Over half of the patients consulted had a primary diagnosis** of deli**rium, dementia, or a cognitive disorder not otherwise specified, using Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition, Text Revision) diagnoses. In most patients, additional laboratory studies or imaging or both were requested and medication changes recommended (initiation, dose changes, and discontinuation). Conclusion This report provides one of the first detailed views of the use of telepsychiatry in a rem**ote in**patient medical setting. Findings will guide education to primary teams and will shape the **develop**ment of future telepsychiatry interventions.  2018 The Academy of Psychosomatic Medicine. eid: 2-s2.0-85029228744
2. **Telepsychiatry for Inpatient Consultations at a Separate Campus of an Academic Medical Center**
Background: Many hospitals do not have regular access to psychiatry consult services. This is well understood as a **common** shortage at nonacademic community hospitals (especially in **rural** environments, and may also be a problem at noncontiguously located smaller hospitals that are affiliated with academic medical **center**s in urban settings. The authors sought to deliver timely **inpati**ent psychiatric consultation-liaison services via telemedicine to a local but physically separated hospital affiliated with an academic medi**cal ce**nter. Materials and Methods: The authors collaborated with an office dedicated to the advancement of telemedicine technology at their academic **medica**l center. They **develop**ed a telemedicine-based care model to deli**ver in**patient consultation-liaison psychiatry consultations to an affiliated (but physically separate) small academic hospital that did not have its own on-site consultation-liaison psychiatry team. Results: The authors were able to successfully complete 30 consultations, each within 24 h. Only 1 patient was ultimately unwilling to participate in the telemedicine interview. As consultations were accomplished on same day as request, patient length of stay was unaffected. Conclusions: This pilot study suggests that telemedicine is a viable mo**del fo**r inpatient consultation-liaison psychiatry services to hospitals without on-site psychiatry resources and represents a viable alternative model of service delivery.  2016, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2016. eid: 2-s2.0-84978032635
3. **Expansion of the consultation-liaison psychiatry paradigm at a university medical center: Integration of diversified clinical and funding models**
The perspective of the contemporary Consultation-Liason Service (CLS) psychiatrist is increasingly one of consultant to medical and surgical colleagues in models other than **inpati**ent medical and surgical units. Simultaneously, the need for a clinically and educationally rob**ust in**patient CLS persists despite funding pressures. The University of California, Davis Medical **Center** Department of Psychiatry has made use of creative organizational and financial models to accompl**ish th**e inpatient CLS clinical and educational missions in a fiscally responsible manner. In addition, the department has in recent years expanded the delivery of psychiatry consultation-liaison clinical and educational services to other models of care delivery, broadening the role and influence of the CLS. Several of the initiatives described in this paper parallel an overall evolution of the practice of consultation-liaison psychiatry in response to managed care influences and other systems pressures. This consultation-liaison paradigm expansion with diversified sources of funding support facilitates the **develop**ment of consultation-liaison psychiatry along additional clinical, administrative, research, and educational dimensions. Other university medi**cal ce**nters may consider adaptation of some of the initiatives described here to their institutions.  2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. eid: 2-s2.0-0038013578
4. **Telepsychiatry "coverage" to a rural inpatient psychiatric unit**
Objective: **Rural** psychiatrists responsible for **inpati**ent psychiatry units in general hospitals often have trouble getting coverage for training, vacations, and periods of illness. This article describes telepsychiatry "coverage" t**o a r**ural general hospital psychiatric unit for 1 week. Materials and Methods: All adult patients meeting criteria **for in**patient mental health treatment in the emergency room were offered admission to the general hospital after obtaining informed consent regarding the** use o**f inpatient telepsychiatry. The number of pati**ents o**n the inpatient psychiatric unit ranged from three to nine, with an average daily census of seven. All psychiatric care was provided via video teleconferencing (VTC) at a bandwidth of 512 kilobits per second using Internet Protocol. Results: Patients with psychosis reported more difficulty hearing the doctor than patients without psychosis and incorporated VTC into delusions in a congruent manner. Patients rated **develop**ment of rapport and effectiveness of treatment higher than staff ratings. Two staff thought telepsychiatry was either not effective for acutely psychotic patients or more effective with higher functioning patients. Conclusions: Short-term co**vera**ge** **of rural inpatient psychiatric units for purposes of vacation, training, and illness is possible using telepsychiatry. Psychiatrist's efficiency and consistency are enhanced with instantaneous connections possible from hospital, office, or home. Significant increases in staff workload will occur without remote access to electronic medical records, electronic physician ordering, and an adequate phy**sical **layout of the inpatient psychiatric unit. Adequate educational preparation of unit staff regarding telepsychiatry and a staff process group during implementation is recommended.

5. **Telepsychiatry by a Public, Academic Medical Center for Inpatient Consults at an Unaffiliated, Community Hospital**
Background: Telepsychiatry has the potential to help address the uneven distribution of psychiatrists between urban and **rural** areas. While telepsychiatry has been used for several decades, employing video conferencing technologies to conduct psychiatry consults to the medical wards** of r**ural hospitals is a more recent application. Objective: To **develop** the first US program wherein psychiatrists covering the consult service at a public, academic medical **center** also delivered same-day consults to patients on the medical wards of unaffi**liate**d, rural hospitals. Methods: We describe the rationale, workflow, technology, case distribution, benefits, and lessons learned from the first 24 months of the service. Results: The program resulted in 156 initial and follow-up consults wherein patient interviews were conducted via live videoconference. An additional 19 curbside consults were done via hospitalist-to-psychiatrist phone calls. Though the initial impetus for **the dev**elopment of the program was to manage involuntarily-detained patients awaiting the availability of a psychiatric bed, the availability of the psychiatrists resulted in the service being used for a wide range of situations and diagnoses. Conclusion: Given the benefits noted by consultants, patients, and community hospital medical staff, the program could be replicated by other institutions.  2018 Academy of Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry eid: 2-s2.0-85059526970

Objective: To **evalu**ate a telepsychiatry clinical service to Wagga Wagga in rural New South Wales, comprising a face-to-face interview with a psychiatrist followed by a telepsychiatry interview with a Sydney-based psychiatrist. Methods: Thirty-one patients were referred to a specialist **mood** disorder clinic in a rural setting for consultation and assessment. A retrospect**ive e**valuation was made to determine the acceptance of the teleconferenced psychiatry and face-to-face psychiatry, as well as the **overal**l patient response. Results: Twenty participants comple**ted a**ll evaluation components. Their results indicated a **satisfact**ion level of 95% with the consultation process as a whole, with 80% happy to use telepsychiatry again and 60% preferring telepsychiatry over travelling to a larger centre for face-to-face consultation. The face-to-face component **was satis**factory for 85% of patients while the telepsychiatry compon**ent was s**atisfactory for 72%. Conclusions: Although face-to-face psychiatry was preferred by this **sampl**e, the telepsychiatry component was highly rated and preferred over travel to larger centres for face-to-face consultation, by residents of rural and remote locations. Certain issues are of more concern in telepsychiatry than face-to-face psychiatry, including confidentiality, rapport, explanation and education. eid: 2-s2.0-4744354629
1. **Does the Use of Telemental Health Alter the Treatment Experience? Inmates' Perceptions of Telemental Health Versus Face-to-Face Treatment Modalities**
In corrections, where staffing limitations tax an overburdened mental health system, telemental health is an increasingly common mode of **mental health servic**e delivery. Although telemental health presents an efficient treatment modality for a spectrum** of mental health se**rvices, it is imperative to study how this modality influences key elements of the treatment experience. In this study, the authors compared inmates' perceptions of the working alliance, postsession **mood**, and **satisfact**ion with psychiatric and psycho**logical mental healt**h services delivered through 2 different modalities: telemental health and face-to-face. Participants consisted of 186 inmates w**ho received mental h**ealth services (36 via telepsychology, 50 via face-to-face psychology, 50 via telepsychiatry, and 50 via face-to-face psychiatry). Results indicate no significant differences in inmates' perceptions of the work alliance with the mental health professional, postsess**ion **mood, or over**all satis**faction with services when telemental health and face-to-face modalities were compared with**in each type of ment**al health service. Implications of these findings are presented.  2008 American Psychological **Associ**ation. eid: 2-s2.0-38949111763
2. **Evaluating the diagnostic agreement between telepsychiatry assessment and face-to-face visit: A preliminary study**
Objective: Despite accumulated evidence that demonstrates clinical outcome of telepsychiatry is comparable with conventional method; little research has been done on telepsychiatry in developing countries. This study aimed to **evalu**ate the diagnostic agreement between telepsychiatry assessment and face-to-face assessment. Moreover, patient and doctor **satisfact**ion was assessed by self-report questionnaire. Method: This study was conducted in an inpatient department of a university-affiliated hospital in Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Iran. The study **sampl**e consisted of 40 inpatients aged over 18 years who were selected from October 2016 to February 2017. All patients were visited once by face-to-face conventional method and once by interactive video teleconsultation by 2 psychiatric consultants. Results: Results of this study revealed that the diagnostic agreement between the 2 interviewers was 75%. Moreover, about 85% of the patients preferred telepsychiatry for follow-up visits. Also, more than 82% of the patients would recommend telepsychiatry to others although 95% of them perceived contact via telepsychiatry as uncomfortable to some extent. Conclusion: Telepsychiatry service can be used for psychiat**ric e**valuation in Iran, and it has a desirable effect on patient and doc**tor satis**faction. The results of this study showed the capacity of moving towards using telepsychiatry.  2020 Korean Cancer **Associ**ation. All rights reserved. eid: 2-s2.0-85083399092

Objective: This study examined the **agreement** between diagnoses and severity ratings assigned by clinicians using a structured web-based **interview** within a child and adolescent mental health outpatient setting. Method: Information on 100 youths was obtained from multiple informants through a web-based Development and Well-Being Assessment (DAWBA). Based on this information, four experienced clinicians independently diagnosed (according to the International Classification of Diseases Revision 10) and **rate**d the severity of mental health problems according to the Health of the Nation Outcome Scales for Children and Adolescents (HoNOSCA) and the Children's Global Assessment Scale (C-GAS). Resul**ts: Agree**ment for diagnosis was K=0.69-0.82. Intra-class **correl**ation for single measures was 0.78 for HoNOSCA and 0.74 for C-GAS, and 0.93 and 0.92, respectively for average measures. Concl**usions: A**greement was good to excellent for all diagnostic **categorie**s. Agreement for severity was **mode**rate, but improved to substantial when the average of the ratings given by all clinicians was considered. Therefore, we conclude that experienced clinicians can assign **reliabl**e diagnoses and assess severity based on DAWBA data collected online.

1. **Application of telepsychiatry: A preliminary study**
Telemedicine is the provision of professional medical services from sites removed from the patient. This study was conducted in order to assess the reliability of psychiatric evaluations via **video**-consultation. The inter- **rate**r reliability was determined for each **interview**ing **condit**ion by employing the reliability-testing paradigm in which the brief psychiatric rating scale (BPRS) and the interclass **correl**ation **coeffici**ent (ICC) are used. The int**er- ****rater** reliability scores between face-to-f**ace inter**vi**ews and i**nterviews conducted** by v**ideo at two different levels of image qualities were compared by the authors. Reliability was found to be in perfect **agreement** in **each of t**he interview**ing co**nditions. This study verifies that telepsychiatry is a **reliabl**e method of assessing **patien**t conditions. It may be used to provide much needed mental health-care services to patients whose access to them is restricted. eid: 2-s2.0-0034014241
2. **The reliability of telepsychiatry for a neuropsychiatric assessment**
Objective: To determine whether or not the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS), an examination that relies on visual judgments, can be **reliabl**y measured via **video** conferencing equipment. Methods: AIMS scores were assessed by two independent **rate**rs in face-to-face contact with the subject and **two ****rater**s observing remotely via audio-visual transmission. We determine**d in****ter-r**ater reliabilities using the Intraclass **Correl**ation **Coeffici**ent (ICC). We assessed if the condi**tion**** of t**he rater influenced the ICC. We distinguished betw**een ****wheth**er the rater was physically in the room with the subject or was connected **via v**ideo. We then statistically compared the differences between these **condit**ions. Results: There were no significant statistical diff**eren****ces b**etween the raters, which could be attributed to **the co**ndition while assessing involuntary movements using the AIMS instrument. Regardless of whether this assessment was conducted by direct observation** or v**ia video conferencing equipment, the results w**ere rel**iable to the same degree. Conc**lusion:** Reliable neuropsychiatric assessments can be conducted using telemedicine even if primarily visual input is evaluated.  Copyright 2011, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-79955081873
3. **Transcultural psychiatry made simple - Asynchronous telepsychiatry as an approach to providing culturally relevant care**
Objective: To examine the feasibility and diagnostic reliability of asynchronous telepsychiatry (ATP) consultations in Spanish and ATP consultation with Spanish-to-English translation. Subjects and Methods: Twenty-four **interview**s of Spanish-speaking patients were **video**recorded by a bilingual clinician who also collected patient history data and gave the Structured Clini**cal Inter**view for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders (SCID-I) to each patient. The ATP da**ta (v**ideo** of the i**nterview and patient history) were forwarded for psychiatric consultation and a diagnostic assessment by the investigators. The ATP data were then examined sepa**rate**ly by two Spanish-speaking psychiatrists, before being translated into English and then re-examined by two English-speaking psychiatrists. **Agreement** between the expert diagnoses of the investigators and the diagnoses from the Spanish consultations, the Spanish-to-English translated consultations, and the SCID-I results was assessed using kappa statistics. Results: We found acceptable levels** of agree**ment for major diagnostic groupings among the Spanish- and English-speaking psychiatrists. Kappa values for dia**gnostic a**greement between the expert and the translated consultations, the original language consultations, and the SCID-I were at least 0.52 **(percenta**ge agreement, 79%) and higher. Conclusions: ATP consultations in Spanish, and those translated from Spanish to English, are feasible, and broad diagnostic reliability was achieved. The ATP process allows for rapid language translation. This approach could be useful across national boundaries and in numerous ethnic groups. Cross-language ATP may also offer significant benefits over the use of real-time interpreting services and has the potential to improve the quality of care by allowing for the addition of culturally relevant information.

4. **Telepsychiatry: Assessment of televideo psychiatric interview reliability with present- and next-generation internet infrastructures**
Objective: We assessed the reliability of remote **video** psychiatric **interview**s conducted via the internet using narrow and broad bandwidths. Method: **Telev**ideo psychiat**ric inter**views conducted with 42 in-patients with chronic schizophrenia using two bandwidths (narrow, 128 kilobits/s; broad, 2 megabits/s) were assessed in terms of **agreement** with face-**to-face i**nterviews in a test-retest fashion. As a contr**ol, agree**ment was assessed between f**ace-to-fa**ce interviews. Psychiatric symptoms were **rate**d using the Oxford version of the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPR**S), and a**g**reement b**etween interviews was estimated as the intraclass **correl**ation **coeffici**ent (ICC). Results: The ICC was significantly lower in the narrow bandwidth than in the broad bandwidth and the control for both positive symptoms score and total score. Conclusion: While reliability o**f te****levideo p**sychiatric interviews is insufficient using the present narrow-band internet infrastructure, the next generation of infrastructure (broad-band) may permit ****reliabl****e diagnostic interviews. eid: 2-s2.0-0034893102

0. **Thinking Outside the Box: Are We Ready for Teleprecepting to Expand Training and Practice Venues?**
A significant challenge related to nurse practitioner (NP) training is the shortage of clinical sites with qualified faculty to precept NP interns. The problem is compounded in **rural** communities with provider shortages, restricting their opportunities to train (and potentially recruit) new APRNs. Consequently, these underserved communities have difficulty accessing specialty providers, such as Psychiatric Mental Health Nurse Practitioners (PMHNPs). Combined with geographic distance from urban communities and generally lower pay, m**any r**ural and/or remote communities struggle with the disparity in contrast to more populated regions. A needs assessment of an underserved county with poor access to psychiatric services suggests that contracted telepsychiatry was costly and failed to address the long-term dearth of local psychiatric providers. Stakeholders reported that local RNs (and possibly FNPs) were employed by the local hospital and that a subgroup may have aptitude and interest in psychiatry if a **univers**ity program and preceptors were available. Collaborating with an urban PMHNP program, televideo technology for clinical training and preceptor **develop**ment offers a solution to the dearth of preceptors. A pilot intervention will use teleprecepting aimed at establishing best practice guidelines for implementation of this novel approach to expanding the clinical training and capa**city **in rural and under-served communities.  2019,  2**019 Uni**versity of California San Francisco. eid: 2-s2.0-85055985260

Objectives: This **paper** reviews the major findings of the Victorian Psychiatry Attraction, Recruitment and Retention Needs Analysis **Project** and considers some of the implications for the psychiatrist workforce working in public sector psychiatry. Conclusions: The report provides a snapshot of the issues that are impairing the ability of Victorian psychiatrists to comprehensively treat those in our community who have severe mental illness. As the report shows, the issues impacting the profession are multi-faceted and complex, yet surmountable.  The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists 2019. eid: 2-s2.0-85070292936
2. **Reaching rural Ohio with intellectual disability psychiatry**
Individuals with intellectual disability experience higher rates of mental illness when compared with the general population, and there is a lack of medical and mental health professionals in **rural** and under-served areas. With the increase in discharge of individuals from institutional settings back to their home communities into the least restrictive environments, there are more patients with complex needs being added to the schedules of physicians in the outpatient delivery care system. Patients with disabilities may not travel well or tolerate changes in routine so may not have access to psychiatry. Utilization of telepsychiatry is well suited to this specialized patient population because it allows a highly traumatized group to meet with a psychiatrist and other mental health professionals from a location of their choice. Ohios Telepsychiatry **Project** for Intellectual Disability was initiated in 2012 to serve outlying communities with a lack of infrastructure and resources, to provide specialized **mental health servic**es to individuals with co-occurring mental illness and intellectual disability. After five years, over 900 patients with intellectual disability from 64 of Ohios 88 counties receive specialized mental health treatment through this statewide grant-fun**ded pro**ject.  2017, The Author(s) 2017. eid: 2-s2.0-85029819907

The Alabama Coalition for a Healthier Black was a demonstration of concept **project**. This **paper** is a descriptive and qualitative overview of this 2.5 y**ear pro**ject. Limi**ted key** project results are reported here. Located in the **rural** Black Belt region of Alabama this coalition had several key aims: to **develop** a collaboration between primary care and mental health care through co-location of services; use of video-conferencing capability to provide **mental health servic**es more efficiently; enhanced training** in r**ural healthcare; **and dev**elopment of stigma reduction campaigns along with other coalition partner specific initiatives. Co-location and telepsychiatry implementation produced the major challenges and resulting adaptations to original aims. Despite many challenges these new service patterns were put into place and appear to be sustainable.  2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC. eid: 2-s2.0-84872618079
4. **Training psychiatrists for rural practice: A 20-year follow-up**
Objective: This report describes the **Rural** Psychiatry Residency Program at the **Univers**ity of New Mexico (UNM RPRP) and presents findings from a survey of program graduates. Methods: Current practice location of residency graduates was identified to learn whether graduates of the UNM RPRP continued to practice** in r**ural communities compared to the graduates of the traditional residency program. Additionally, a web-based survey was completed by 37 of the 60 graduates who participated in the UNM RPRP since its inception in 1991 through 2010. Questions addressed current practice, perceived barriers, and perceptions of experiences. Results: Thirty-seven percent of the graduates from the UNM RPRP currently prac**tice **in rural communities compared to 10 % of the graduates from the traditional residency track. Of the survey respondents, 95 % continue to work with underserved individuals. Reported barriers to **pract**ice in rural areas include professional isolation, lack of referral resources, and travel distances. Respondents reported valuing education about systems based practice and telepsychiatry. Conclusion: Purposeful and well-coordinated educational opportunit**ies s**ituated in rural community health clinics can address some of the barriers for recruiting and retaining practici**ng ps**ychiatrists in rural areas. Practical skill building at the individual, agency, and system level is integral in training psychiatrists for work in these communities. In particular, the use of telepsychiatry emerged as an important practical applicati**on fo**r the provision of rural mental health care.  2014 Academic Psychiatry. eid: 2-s2.0-84907187036
5. **Developing telepsychiatry services in kwazulu-Natal - an action research study**
Objective: In 2009, the Departments of Psychiatry and Telehealth of the **Univers**ity of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN) initiated a three year **project** to **develop** telepsychiatry services in KwaZulu-Natal. This **paper** describes the challenges and opportunities of t**his pro**ject. Method: This was a collaborative, in situ health **service** project and an action research framework was adopted. Over the three years, following a needs assessment and an e-health Readiness Assessment, two action research cycles were completed. Cycle 1: The preparation, implementation and evaluation of educational material, technical requirements and clinical guidelines and clinical support materials. Cycle 2: Preparation and evaluation of educational and clinical outreach sessions. Results: Videoconference education sessions were beneficial to health staff without post-qualification psychiatry training. A flexible format for education improved knowledge outcomes. Clinical sessions are feasible, but require administration and technical support for facilitation. With facilitator training, 128Kbps is a suitable bandwidth for education but 384Kbps is preferred for clinical consultation. Conclusion: Telepsychiatry offers tremendous potential to facilitate the three strategies suggested by the World Psychiatric Association to address the treatment gap, save time and costs and improve access to the small pool of specialist psychiatrists in resource constrained environments. eid: 2-s2.0-84871026764

7. **A Review of Mental Health Approaches for Rural Communities: Complexities and Opportunities in the Canadian Context**
Three mental health approaches with potential relevance to **rural** Canada were reviewed: telepsychiatry, integrated mental health models, and community-based approaches. These approaches have been evaluated in relation to their cost-effectiveness, comprehensiveness, client-centredness, cultural appropriateness, acceptability, feasibility and fidelity; criteria that may vary ami**dst r**ural contexts. Collaborative approaches to care, technologies fully integrated into local health systems, multi-sectoral capacity-building, and further engagement with informal social support networks may be particularly promising strate**gies **in rural communities. More research is required t**o det**ermine rural mental health pathways among diverse social groups, and further, to establish the acceptability of novel approaches in mental health. eid: 2-s2.0-84959270278
8. **A pilot project to improve access to Telepsychotherapy at rural clinics**
Background: The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has pioneered telemental health (TMH) with over 500,000 TMH encounters over the past decade. VA community-based outpatient clinics were established to improve accessibility of mental healthcare for **rural** Veterans. Despite these clinics clinics and increased availability of TMH, m**any r**ural Veterans have difficulty receiving mental healthcare, particularly psychotherapy. Materials and Methods: Twelve therapists participated in a pilot **project** using TMH technologies to improve mental healthcare service deli**very **to rural Veterans treated at six community clinics. Therapists completed online training, and study staff communicated with them monthly and clinical leaders every other month. Therapists completed two questionnaires: before training and 10 months later. This article describes barriers and facilitators to the implementation of **the pro**ject, as well as therapists' knowledge, confidence, and motivation regarding TMH. Results: Two clinicians were offering telepsychotherapy after 10 months. At all six sites, unanticipated organizational constraints and administrative barriers delayed implementation; establishing organizational practices and therapists' motivation helped facilitate the process. Adopters** of the** project reported more positive views of the modality and did not worry about staffing, a concern of nonadopters. Conclusions: Despite barriers to implementation, lessons learned from** this p**ilot project have led to improvements and changes in TMH processes. Results from the pilot showed that therapists providing telepsychotherapy had increased confidence, knowledge, and motivation. As TMH continues to expand, formalized decision-making with clinical le**aders r**egarding project goals, better matching of therapists with this modality, and assessment of medical center and clinic readiness are recommended.  2014, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-84891592314
9. **A telepsychiatry model to support psychiatric outreach in the public sector in South Africa**
The access of **rural** Mental Health Care Users in South Africa to specialist psychiatrists and quality mental health care is currently sub-optimal. Health professionals and planners working in psychiatry lack a well-defined and feasible outreach model to facilitate the delivery of services to remote **and r**ural areas. In response to this challenge, a three-year action research telepsychiatry study was undertaken by the Departments of Psychiatry and TeleHealth at the **Univers**ity of KwaZulu-Natal, to **develop** a telepsychiatry outreach model based on local research and international evidence. The Model draws on needs and infrastructure assessments of the designated psychiatric hospitals in the province, a review of the published international evidence on telepsychiatry and videoconference-based education, and an evaluation of local clinical and educational telepsychiatry implementations in KwaZulu-Natal. The Model proposed is "virtual", i.e. not bound to provincial or district referral patterns, aims not to add to the burden on the current workforce and is intended to be integrated into psychiatry outreach services and policy. The Model should be subjected to in situ testing for validation and implementation. It is hoped that an implementation of this Model will improve the access of Mental Health Care Users to specialist psychiatry care. eid: 2-s2.0-84870978861
10. **Continuing professional development for Australian rural psychiatrists by videoconference**
Objective: The **Rural** Special Interest Group (RSIG) of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists provided a program of educational meetings for psychiatrists and trainees** in r**ural locations to decrease professional isolation and facilitate opportunities to obtain credit for continuing professional **develop**ment (CPD) purposes in ongoing professional registration. A pilot peer review group by videoconference was also implemented in Western Australia, to provide peer review for psychiatrists working in isolation. Method: Six national interactive videoconferenced education seminars were provided. The membership was polled prior to the program for topic preferences and requested speakers, who were subsequently approached to present the seminars. A West Australian peer review group was formed, involving psychiatrists from five di**ffere**nt rural locations and one psychiatrist from the metropolitan area. Results: National seminars were attended by 106 individuals (67% consultant psychiatrists, 17% trainees and 16% allied health professionals). Evaluation demonstrates favourable views of the content and quality of the presentations and impact on practice patterns. Conclusions: Attendance at seminars via videoconferenci**ng pr**ovided rural psychiatrists with opportunities to obtain CPD credit without the need to travel, providing a cost-effective alternative for accessing education. Involvement enabled interaction among peers throughout Australia, alleviating professional isolation and generating networking opportunities. The West Australian peer review group demonstrated sustainability with a commitment to continuation and positive impact on practice. eid: 2-s2.0-48749111372

12. **Telepsychiatry for neurocognitive testing in older rural latino adults**
As the population of older Latinos in the U.S. increases, availability of culturally adapted geriatric psychiatry services is becoming a growing concern. This issue is exacerbated for **rural** Latino populations. In this study, we assessed whether neuro-cognitive assessment via telepsychiatry (TP) using a Spanish-language battery would be comparable to in-person (IP) testing using the same battery in a sample of Spanish-speaking older adults i**n a r**ural setting. Patients (N = 22) received IP and TP testing 2 weeks apart. The order of IP and TP test administrations in individual subjects was determined randomly. Comparison of scores indicated that there were no significant differences between IP and TP test performance though both groups scored non-significantly higher at the second visit. This study demonstrates feasibility and utility of neurocognitive testing in Spanish using TP amon**g old**er rural Latinos.  2015 American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry. eid: 2-s2.0-84942746515
13. **Rural mental health: Implications for telepsychiatry in clinical service, workforce development, and organizational capacity**
In Hawai'i, **rural** residents suffer disproportionately from poor health and mental health outcomes. Hawai'i's island geography ma**kes r**ural health service disparities especially compelling. Physician workforce shortages are **project**ed to increase, despite 30 years of programs aimed at recruiting physic**ians **to rural areas. Telepsychiatry has been shown to be a feasible way to provide a variety of health services to individual**s liv**ing in rural areas with limited access to healthcare. The Univer**sity **of Hawai'i Rural Health Collaboration (UHRHC) was established by the Department of Psychiatry to address the need for workfo**rce d**evelopment and rural access to **mental health servic**es across the State of Hawai'i by using telepsychiatry. Partnerships with community health clinics have been formed to provide patient care and consultation-liaison services through telepsychiatry technology. In addition, UHRHC focuses on workforce **develop**ment in its residency training curriculum by utilizing a servi**ce-le**arning approach to rural mental health. Evaluation of these efforts is currently underway, with preliminary evidence suggesting that UHRHC is a promising strategy to increase access to criti**cal mental health se**rvices and r**educe** health disparities in rural Hawai'i.

14. **Attitudes toward medical and mental health care delivered via telehealth applications among rural and urban primary care patients**
Adequate health care services are often not available in **rural** and remote areas, and this problem is expected to grow worse in the near future. "Telehealth" interventions represent a strategy for addressing access to care problems. We examined and compared attitudes toward medical and mental health care delivered via telehealth applications among ad**ult r**ural (n = 112) and urban (n = 78) primary care patients. We also examined attitudes toward telehealth applications among a subset of patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-a group likely in need of specialized services. Both ur**ban a**nd rural patients were receptive to receiving medical and psychiatric services via telehealth. There were few meaningful differences across variables betwee**n urb**an and rural patients, and there were no meaningful differences by PTSD status. These findings support the feasibility of telehealth applications, p**artic**ularly for rural patients who may not otherwise receive needed services.  2008 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-39149100645
15. **The use of telemedicine in psychiatry**
This **paper** examines the potential effects of using video-conferencing within the field of mental health in the UK. In order to assess the usefulness of telepsychiatric services, an electronic search was conducted for articles published between August 1998 and July 2006 using the MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychINFO and Telemedicine and Information Exchange (TIE) databases. The search was carried out using the following terms: telepsychiatry, videoconferencing and telepsychology. A total of 178 articles were identified and based on review of the abstracts 72 were identified as being specific to efficacy, cost-effectiveness and satisfaction with psychiatric services delivered via videoconferencing. T**his p**aper concludes that the use of video conferencing can enhance psychiatric services within the UK especially for those patients who live in **rural** areas. Current advances in technology make this an increasingly more reliable and cost-effective method for assessing patients. The limitations of telemedicine are discussed and it is clear that this type of care is not suitable for all patients. Further research is required to assess the types of patients that telepsychiatry is most suitable for.  2006 The Author. eid: 2-s2.0-33750682657
16. **The importance of external clinical facilitation for a perinatal and infant telemental health service**
Introduction: Clinical facilitation is an established strategy for introducing innovation into clinical practice. The Queensland Centre for Perinatal and Infant Mental Health has used clinical facilitation to establish a telehealth service to support perinatal and infant mental health in regional, **rural** and remote areas of the Australian state of Queensland. The aim of this study is to explore the role of clinical facilitation in implementing and sustaining the telehealth service. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 14 remote-site users of the telehealth service. Interviews were analysed using thematic analysis. Results: Two dominant themes emerged: unmet need and service visibility. The study confirms the usefulness of telehealth as a way to address unmet need for specialist **mental health servic**es in region**al, r**ural and remote areas. The study also provides evidence that a telehealth service with intermittent demand requires a consistent clinical facilitator, to keep the service visible to remote-site clinicians and maintain awareness of the service as a referral option. Conclusion: Previous research has identified the importance of clinical facilitation in initial service implementation. This study demonstrates the necessity of clinical facilitation for ongoing service provision. Facilitation is likely to be more important where the telehealth service responds to intermittent or infrequent clinical need, compared with high-volume services where clinics are conducted routinely.

**Background**: Since 1999, the University Hospital Zurich (Zurich, Switzerland) has offered an e-mail-based consultation service for individual health concerns where anonymous questions can be asked to an online doctor. This study aimed at the characterization of the user profile, the content of the question, and the answers given specific in the field of psychiatry. Materials and Methods: In total, 3,148 questions were asked from 2008 to 2010. Of these, 209 (6.6%) requests were selected by International Classification of Diseases-10 and International Classification of Primary Care codes relevant for psychiatry and included in the retrospective **qualit**ative study. The content analysis of the requests was supported by means of the Mayring inductive category system using a professional text analysis program (MAXQDA). Results: Of the users, 45.9% were female, and 46.9% were male. The mean age was 37.4 years. The main topics of the request were somatoform, somatization, and hypochondriac disorders in 18.4%, behavioral syndromes in 17.9%, and **mood** disorders in 15.4%. The reason stated most frequently for using the service was looking for a second opinion. The doctors responded with detailed information about disease and treatment and in 70.8% recommended consultation of a physician. Conclusions: Telemedicine is suggested to empower patients by developing health literacy with professional advice. The gender ratio of the users is almost equal, although the prevalence of psychological diseases in the general population is higher in women than in men. Psychological online consultation may potentially reach mentally ill individuals who do not have or did not seek professional help yet, and it seems to be especially attractive for men.  2015, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-84921509769
1. **Designing and implementing an innovative digitally driven primary care psychiatry program in India**
**Background**: Primary Care Doctors (PCDs) are the first contact for majority of patients with psychiatric disorders across the world including **India**. They often provide symptomatic treatment which is naturally inadequate. Absence or inadequate exposure to psychiatric training during undergraduate medical education is one of the prime reasons. Classroom training (CRT), a standard practice to train PCDs is driven by specialist based psychiatric curriculum and inherently lacks clinical translational value. Aim and Context: The 'Department of Psychiatry' of 'National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences', Bengalu**ru, I**ndia has recently come up with an innovative digitally driven modules of 'Primary Care Psychiatry Program' (PCPP) for practicing PCDs. Goal of this paper is to provide an overview of all these (five) modules with its various stages of implementation. Methods: Authors briefly discuss the **current** status of primary care psychi**atry **in India and also narrate the newly designed five modules of PCPP in this paper. Results and Discussion: An adopted psychiatric curriculum is designed in 'Clinical Schedules for Primary Care Psychiatry' (CSP) which is an integral part of PCPP. This is brief clinical schedules contains culturally appropriate screening questionnaire, transdiagnostic classification of 8 core psychiatric disorders, diagnostic, referral and management guidelines. PCPP contains 5 modules named as orientation module, basic module, advanced module [Tele-psychiatric 'On-Consultation Training' (Tele-OCT)], videoconference based continuing skill development module, and collaborative video consultation modules which covers all essential areas of primary care psychiatry for practicing PCDs. Last three modules are fully designed digital modules in hub and spoke model of Tele Medicine. In this designed program, the CSP and Tele-OCT are two path braking innovations having inbuilt higher clinical translation value. The challenges and opportunities that could be faced during its implementa**tion **across India are also discussed. Conclusion and Future Directions: Innovative PCPP is pragmatic in nature and has potential for higher clinical translational value. Once validated thoroughly, PCPP has po**tenti**al for pan-India expansion. There is a need for artificial intelligence-based modules for ne**xt ph**ase of PCPP in India considering her population and lesser number of availab**le ps**ychiatrists.  2018 Indian Journal of Psychiatry | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow. eid: 2-s2.0-85052293597
2. **Coping, productive time use, and negative mood among adults with severe mental illness: A daily diary study**
Most studies on coping among persons with severe mental illness have relied on retrospective self-report methods; a limitation of this methodology is susceptibility to recall bias. The purpose of the present investigation was to expand the **current** understanding of the impact of coping among persons with severe mental illness by examining coping strategies, **mood**, and social functioning (operationalized as productive time use) using a daily process design. Twenty-seven adults diagnosed with severe mental illness completed baseline clinical interviews and up to 20 days of nightly tele**phone** interviews addressing coping and daily life. A total of 198 coping efforts were reported for 387 days. Mixed-effects regression analyses examined the association between type of daily coping strategy (problem-centered, neutral, or avoidant) and both daily proportion of time participants spent in productive activity and daily negat**ive **mood, controlling for demographic and clinical variables. The results indicated that productive time use was significantly lower on days when avoidant strategies were used, in contrast with days when problem-centered strategies and neutral strategies were used. There was no significant main effect of coping on n**egat**ive mood, although there was a trend in the expected direction. Findings support the hypothesis that the types of coping strategies adults with severe mental illness use are related to better social functioning on a daily level.  2010 Elsevier B.V. eid: 2-s2.0-78249245684
3. **'SMS' for mental health - Feasibility and acceptability of using text messages for mental health promotion among young women from urban low income settings in India**
Objective: The **current** study assesses the acceptability and feasibility of **mobil**e text messages for promoting positive mental health and as a helpline among **young** women in urban slums of Bangalore. Methodology: Forty girls in the age range of 16-18 years from urban slums received messages every day for a month. They could call or message back or give a 'missed call' to the same number whenever they had emotional problems or felt like talking to a counselor. The received responses in the form of return texts, missed calls and return **phone** calls were recorded. Feedback about the feasibility and acceptability of **the m**obile messages was collected after a month. Results: 25 out of 40 (62.5%) participants called back, asking for mental health services and to say they felt good about the messages. 23 of 40 (57.5%) messaged back regarding their feelings. 62% reported that they felt supported with the mental health messages. Male family members of nearly half of the participants called back to check the authenticity of the source. Most women did not face any problems because of the messages. Conclusion: This pilot **qualit**ative study indicat**es th**at mobile text messages are a feasible and culturally acceptable method for mental health promotion and prevention am**ong y**oung women from urban slums in **India**. Issues such as consent from the woman and family, ensuring confidentiality and providing authentic and reliable support services, need to be taken into account before attempting to scale up such a service, particularly in vulnerable groups.  2014 Elsevier B.V. eid: 2-s2.0-84912031259
4. **A qualitative study of young people's perspectives on receiving psychiatric services via televideo**
Objective: It is critical to consult **young** people about their experiences. This study addresses the paucity of research on the perspective** of y**oung people in general, and in paediatric telepsychiatry specifically. The goal is to understand the experi**ence **of young people receiving telepsychiatry. Method: Interpretive interactionism (Denzin, 1989) was used to i**nterv**iew 30 young people; immediately following the consultation and four to six weeks later. Analysis occurred via a series of steps in keeping with the interpretive interactionist framework. Results: Four themes arose repeatedly: the encounter with the psychiatrist and experience of having others in the room; the helpfulness of the session; a sense of personal choice during the consultation; and, the technology. Participants highlighted the importance of their relationship with the psychiatrist. Participant's narratives were replete with examples of ways that they actively took responsibility and exerted control within the session itse**lf. C**onclusion: Young people have a significant role to play in their own care. It is critical that telepsychiatry recommendations be explained an**d opp**ortunities for young people to express their concerns and discuss alternatives are provided. Fur**ther **efforts to include young people may include ensuring offering alternate treatments and/or negotiated when recommended treatments are unacceptable and/or resisted. eid: 2-s2.0-77949602145
5. **Applying mobile technologies to mental health service delivery in South Asia**
**Mobil**e **phone**s have increasingly assumed an important role in the treatment of mental disorders in high-income countries. This paper considers such possibilities in the South Asian context. First, a brief review** of m**ob**ile p**hone use in mental disorders is provided. Next, data on the market penetration and dissemina**tion **of** mobi**le phones in South Asia is presented. Finally, common barriers to treatment for mental disorders in South Asia are evaluated against solutions that could be d**erive**d from mobile technologies. Though not witho**ut th**eir ri**sks, ****mobile phon**es have the potential to increase engagement, treatment, and retention of South Asian patients with mental disorders in unprecedented ways.  2012 Elsevier B.V. eid: 2-s2.0-84866153860
6. **A mobile phone program to track young people's experiences of mood, stress and coping**
**Background**: Research examining **adolesc**ent **mood**, stresses, and coping has tended to use retrospective questionnaires which are affected by recall biases. The aim of this study was to develop, pilot, and evaluate a youth-friendly **mobil**e **phone** program to monitor, in real-time, **young** people's everyday experiences** of **mood, stress, and their coping behaviours. Method and design: A momentary sampling program was designed **for m**ob**ile p**hones, and ran for 7 days, administering a brief questionnaire four random times each day, capturing information on **current** ac**tivi**ty, mood, responses **to n**egative mood, stresses, alcohol and cannabis use. Eleven high school students reviewed the program in focus groups, and 18 students completed 7 days of monitoring. Results: Engagement w**ith t**he mobile type program was high with 76% of 504 possible entries completed and 94% (17/18) of the participants reporting that the program adequately** cap**tured their moods, thoughts, and acti**vitie**s. The mobiletype program captured meaningful and analyzable data on the **w**ay y****oung people's moods, stresses, coping strategies, and alcohol and cannabis use, vary both between and within individuals. C**onclu**sions: The mobile type program captured a range of detailed and interesting **qualit**ative and quantitative dat**a abo**ut **youn**g people's everyday mood, stresses, responses, and general functioning.

7. **Perspectives of Young Adults on Receiving Telepsychiatry Services in an Urban Early Intervention Program for First-Episode Psychosis: A Cross-Sectional, Descriptive Survey Study**
**Background**: Limited knowledge exists on telepsychiatry in specialized services for first-episode psychosis (FEP), despite its potential for improving service access and engagement. Objective: To explore access and use of technology, obstacles to attending clinic appointments, and perspectives of **young** adults with FEP on using telepsychiatry as part of outpatient services. Methods: A cross-sectional, descriptive survey study was conducted between July and October 2017 w**ith y**oung adults between the ages of 18 and 38 recruited from a specialized program for FEP in an urban Canadian setting. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and content analysis. Results: Among 51 participants (mean age = 26.1, SD = 4.2; 59% male; 20% experiencing housing instability), more than half (59%, n = 30) rarely or never used mainstream video chat (e.g., Facetime). The majority (78%, n = 40) reported obstacles to attending appointments, with several (37%, n = 19) identifying two or more. Almost half (49%, n = 25) were very favorable towards telepsychiatry and a quarter (25%, n = 13) were somewhat favorable. Participants expressed several concerns about telepsychiatry, including loss of human contact and confidentiality. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is a first study on the perspectives of individuals with FEP about telepsychiatry. Despite experiencing obstacles to attending appointments and expressing receptivity towards telepsychiatry, participants did not have access to these services. It is important to provide education to clinicians on the potential of telepsychiatry to improve service access. Also, more research is needed on when, where, and how telepsychiatry can be integrated into existing care while addressing patient and clinician concerns.

0. **Alcohol abuse management in primary care: An e-learning course**
Background: The mental health knowledge gap challenges public health. The **Alcohol** **Abus**e Management in Primary Care (AAMPC) is an e-learning course designed to co**ver alc**ohol-**relat**ed problems from the primary care perspective. The goal of this study was to verify if the AAMPC was able to enhance healthcare profess**ionals'** alco**hol-r**elated problems knowledge. Materials and Methods: One hundred subscriptions for the AAMPC were offered through the federal telehealth program. The course was instructor-led and had nine weekly classes, delivered synchronously or asynchronously, at the students' convenience, using a varied array of learning tools. At the beginning, students took a test that provided a positive** scor**e, related to critical knowledge for clinical management, and a nega**tive **score, related to misconcep**tions **a**bo**ut alcohol-related problems. The test was repeated 2 months after course completion. Results: Thirty-three students completed the course. The positive score improved significantly (p<0.001), but not the negative score. Students with previous experience with e-courses presented greater improvement on the positive score (p<0.036). Eighty-percent of the students thought the course excelled in meeting its objectives. Web conferences and video and audio recordings were the most appreciated learning tools. Course satisfac**tion **was negatively related to frequency of Internet access (Spearman's rho=-0.455, p=0.022). Conclusions: E-learning was highly appreciated as a learning tool, especially by students with the least frequency of Internet use. Nonetheless, it worked better for those previously familiar with e-courses. The AAMPC e-course provided effective knowledge transmission and **retent**ion. Complementary strategies to reduce misco**nc**eptio****ns about alcohol-related problems must be **develop**ed for the training of primary care staff.

1. **Telemedicine-delivered treatment interventions for substance use disorders: A systematic review**
With increased negative impacts from opioid and other **substanc**e use disorders in the US, it is important for treatments to not only be effective, but also accessible to patients. Treatment delivery via telemedicine, specifically, the use of videoconferencing, which allows real time communication between a patient and a clinician at a distant site, has been shown to be an effective approach for increasing reach and access to treatments for mental health disorders and other chronic illnesses. This **systemat**ic review identified and summarized studies examining the effectiveness of telemedicine interventions to deliver treatment for patients w**ith subs**tance use disorders. Out of 841 manuscripts that met our **search** criteria, 13 studies met the inclusion criteria. Studies covered interventions for nicotine, **alcohol** and **opioid use** disorders. They varied widely in size, quality, and in the comparison groups examined. Studies examined both delivery of psychotherapy and medication treatments. Most studies suggested telemedicine interventions were associated with high patient satisfaction and are an effective alternative, especially when access to treatment is otherwise limited. However, there were substantial methodological limitations to th**e rese**arch conducted to date. Further studies are needed, including larger scale randomized studies that examine different models of telemedicine that can be integrated into existing healthcare delivery settings, to increase the use of effective treatments for patien**ts with **substance use disorders.  2019 eid: 2-s2.0-85063614225
2. **Telepsychological services with criminal justice and substance abuse clients: A systematic review and meta-analysis**
Recent years have seen the incorporation of telepsychology into poorly accessed, rural, and underserved settings, including criminal justice and **substanc**e **abus**e treatment. A **systemat**ic **search** of the literature on telepsychological and **relat**ed services with justice-involved **and subs**ta**nce **abuse clients revealed numerous descriptive reports, but few empirical studies. The results of 3 studies of criminal justice participants and 2 stu**dies of **su**bsta**nce-abuse participants were subjected to a series of 5 outcome-specific meta-analyses (mental health symptoms, therapeutic processes, program engagement, program performance, and service satisfaction). These 5 studies, all of which utilized a comparison group, contributed a total of 342 participants and 14 total effect sizes. Summary data on 3 additional uncontrolled studies are also presented. Results indicated that telepsychological outcomes were at least comparable with in-person outcomes. This review serves as an initial reference for clinicians and policymakers working with criminal **justice **an**d su**bstance abuse clients, but also highlights the need for more rigorous scientific investigation into the nuances of telepsychological practice. eid: 2-s2.0-84957955680
3. **Treatment outcome comparison between telepsychiatry and face-to-face buprenorphine medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorder: A 2-year retrospective data analysis**
Objectives: To retrospectively review clinic records to assess the difference between face-to-face and telepsychiatry buprenorphine medication-assisted treatment (MAT) programs for the treatment of **opioid use** disorder on 3 outcomes: additional **substanc**e use, average time to achieve 30 and 90 consecutive days of abstinence, and treatment **retent**ion rates at 90 and 365 days. Methods: Medical records of patients (N=100) who were participating in telepsychiatry and in face-to-face group-based outpatient buprenorphine MAT programs were reviewed and assessed using descriptive statistical analysis. Results: In comparison with the telepsychiatry MAT group, the face-to-face MAT group showed no significant difference in terms of additio**nal subs**tance use, time to 30 days (P=0.09) and 90 days of abstinence (P=0.22),** or re**tention rates at 90 and 365 days (P=0.99). Conclusions: We did not find any significant statistical difference between telepsychiatry buprenorphine MAT intervention through videoconference and face-to-face MAT treatment in our Comprehensive Opioid Addiction Treatment model for individuals diagnosed w**ith opioid** use disorder in terms of add**itional **substance use, average time to 30 and 90 days of abstinence, and tr**eatmen**t retention rates.

4. **Effectiveness and feasibility of telepsychiatry in resource constrained environments? A systematic review of the evidence**
Objective: A review of **systemat**ic reviews of the effectiveness and feasibility of videoconference-based telepsychiatry services for resource constrained environments was conducted. Specifically with the aim of producing an evidence-based review of the effectiveness and feasibility of videoconference-based telepsychiatry services in resource constrained countries like South Africa. Methods: Eight key questions on telepsychiatry effectiveness and feasibility were identified and inclusion and exclusion criteria were **develop**ed. Review of citations from 2000-2011 from CINAHL, Medline, Pubmed, PsycInfo, EBSCOhost, SABINET, Cochrane Database** of Syst**ematic Reviews (CCTR), Cochrane Controlled Trial Registry (CCTR), Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE), unpublished abstracts through NEXUS and internet **search** engines (Google/Google scholar) was conducted. Resul**ts: Ten **systematic reviews were included for review. Despite the methodological limitations and heterogen**eity of **the systematic reviews, there appears to be good evidence of effectiveness (reliability and improved outcomes) and feasibility (use, satisfaction, acceptability and cost) for videoconference-based telepsychiatry internationally. The application of this evidence in lower middle income countries is dependent on the integration of telepsychiatry into local health system contexts. Conclusion: Based on the evidence, resource constrained countries such as South Africa should be encouraged** to dev**elop telepsychiatry programs along with rigorous evaluation methods. eid: 2-s2.0-84871017282
5. **Use of Tele-Mental Health in Conjunction With In-Person Care: A Qualitative Exploration of Implementation Models**
OBJECTIVE: Although use of tele-mental health services is growing, there is limited re**search** on how tele-mental health is deployed. This project aimed to describe how health centers use tele-mental health in conjunction with in-person care. METHODS: The 2018 **Substanc**e **Abus**e and Mental Health Services Administration Behavioral Health Treatment Services Locator database was used to identify community mental health centers and federally qualified health centers with telehealth capabilities. Maximum diversity sampling was applied to recruit health center leaders to participate in semistructured interviews. Inductive and deductive approaches were used to **develop** site summaries, and a matrix analysis was conducted to identify and refine themes. RESULTS: Twenty health centers in 14 states participated. All health centers used telepsychiatry for diagnostic assessment and medication prescribing, and 10 also offered therapy via telehealth. Some health centers used their own staff to provide tele-mental health services, whereas others contracted with external providers. In most health centers, tele-mental health was used as an adjunct to in-person care. In choosing between tele-mental health and in-person care, health centers often considered patient preference, patient acuity, and insurance status or payer. Although most health centers planned to continue offering tele-mental health, participants noted drawbacks, including less patient engagement, challenges sharing information within the care team, and greater inefficiency. CONCLUSIONS: Tele-mental health is generally used as an adjunct to in-person care. The results of this study can inform policy makers and clinicians regarding the various delivery models that incorporate tele-mental health. eid: 2-s2.0-85084961417

0. **Using telepsychiatry to enrich existing integrated primary care**
**Background**: Integrated care is characterized by evolving heterogeneity in models. Using telepsychiatry to enhance these models can increase access, quality, and efficiencies in care. Introduction: The **purpos**e of this report is to describe the process and outcomes of adapting telepsychiatry into an existing integrated care service. Materials and Methods: Telepsychiatry was implemented into an existing integrated care model in a high-volume, urban, primary care clinic in Colorado serving patients with complex physical and **behavior**al needs. Consultative, direct care, educational/training encounters, provider-to-provider communication, process changes, and patient-level descriptive measures were tracked as part of ongoing quality improvement. Results: Telepsychiatry was adapted into the exist**ing beha**vioral health services using an iterative team meeting process within a stepped care model. Over 35% of the requests for psychiatry services were medication related-and medication changes (type/dose) were the most frequent referral outcome of psychiatric consultation. Forty percent of patients in the service had m**ultiple ****behavioral health** diagnoses, in addition to physical health diagnoses. Discussion: Telehealth will become an increasingly necessary component in building hybrid/blended integrated care teams. Examples of flexible model implementation will support clinics in tailoring effective applications for their unique patient panels. Conclusions: An adapted integrated care model leveraging telepsychiatry is successfully serving the complex deep end of a primary care patient **popul**ation in Colorado. Lessons learned in implementing this model include the **import**ance of team attitudes.  2019, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-85071183030
1. **Treatment of Behavior Disturbances with Ketamine in a Patient Diagnosed with Major Neurocognitive Disorder**
A 77-year-old woman who had been previously diagnosed with a major neurocognitive disorder became highly agitated and aggressive in a long-term care facility. She did not respond to intramuscular (IM) haloperidol plus lorazepam and had to be transported to the local emergency department (ED). In the ambulance, she remained highly agitated and was given 200 mg IM **ketamin**e. Within minutes of receiving this, she de-escalated dramatically with no apparent adverse effects and remained stable for several days. Altho**ugh ket**amine has been used recently in pre-hospital settings and EDs to reduce agitated **behavior**, there has been little if any investigation of its potential for reduc**ing beha**vior disturbances in patients who suffer from major neurocognitive dis**orders.** Ketamine could potentially be a **promis**ing treatment **option** for this **popul**ation, but more research is needed.  2018 eid: 2-s2.0-85044665275

3. **The Digital Revolution in Behavioral Health**
**BACKGROUND**: Technology is disrupting every modern industry, from supermarkets to car manufacturing, and is now entering the health care space. Technological innovations in psychiatry include the opportunity for conducting therapy via two-way video conferencing, providing electronic consultations, and telementoring and education of community health care providers. Use of mobile health applications is also an expanding area of interest and **promis**e. OBJECTIVE: The **purpos**e of this article is to review the evolution and pros and cons of technology-enabled health care since the digital movement in psychiatry began more than 50 years ago as well as describe the University of Rochesters innovative digital **behavior**al health care model. METHODS: A review of the literature and recent reports on innovations in digi**tal beha**vioral health care was conducted, along with a review of the University of Rochesters model to describe the current state of **digital ****behavioral health** care. RESULTS: Given the lack of access to care and mental health professional shortages in many parts of the United States, particularly **rural** are**as, digi****tal behavioral he**alth care will be an increasingly **import**ant strategy for managing mental health care needs. However, there are numerous hurdles to be overcome in adopting digital health care, including provider resistance and knowledge gaps, lack of reimbursement parity, restrictive credentialing and privileging, and overregulation at both the state and federal levels. CONCLUSIONS: Digital health innovations are transforming the delivery of mental health care services and psychiatric mental health nurses can be on the forefront of t**his im**portant digital revolution.

Objective: The **Gulf Coast** continues to struggle with service need far outpacing available resources. Since 2005, the **Region**al Coordinating Center for **Hurrican**e Response (**RCC**) at Morehouse School of **Medicin**e, Atlanta, GA, has **support**ed telehealth solutions designed to meet high service needs (e.g., psychiatry) within primary care and other healthcare organizations. The over**all** RCC vision is** to sup**port autonomous, useful, and sustainable telehealth programs towards mitigating unmet disaster-related needs. Subjects and Methods: To ass**ess Gulf C**oast telehealth experiences, we conducted semistructured interviews with b**oth re**gional key informants and **nation**al organizatio**ns with Gu**lf Coast recovery interests. Using qualitative-descriptive analysis, interview transcripts were analyzed to identify shared **develop**ment themes. Results: Thirty-eight key informants were interviewed, representing a 77.6% participation rate among organizations engaged** by** the RCC. Seven elements **critic**al to telehealth success were identified: Funding, Regulatory, Workflow, Attitudes, Personnel, Technology, and Evaluation. These key informant accounts reveal shared insights with telehealth regarding successes, challenges, and recommendations. Conclusions: The seven eleme**nts cr**itical to telehealth success both confirm and organ**ize dev**elopment principles from a diverse collective of healthcare stakeholders.

2. **Teleconsultation and Training of VHA Providers on Transgender Care: Implementation of a Multisite Hub System**
Background: The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is piloting a **nation**al program providing teleconsultation and training to clinicians to increase knowledge and comfort with treating transgender veterans and to expand clinical capacity. This program is based on Project ECHO and uses specialist expertise to train and educate front-line clinicians. Over time, the front-line clinicians increase knowledge and skills, enabling them to provide care locally and obviate need for patient travel. This program is innovative in **its na**tional scope, interdisciplinary team model, and multihub structure. This article describes **develop**ment of the program and **initi**al results for the first cohort of learners. Materials and Methods: Five interdisciplinary clinical teams participated in the 14-session, 7-month program. Most teams had some experience treating transgender veterans prior to participation. Results: The teams completed at least 12 of 14 sessions. Thirteen of 33 participants completed an evaluation. In general, respondents found the teleconsultation program very helpful and credited the experience with improving their team functioning. Furthermore, respondents reported a significant increase in confidence to treat transgender veterans by the end of the program (59% versus 83%). We explored whether it is possible to recruit VHA clinical teams to participate in lengthy training on a low prevalence but complex condition. Conclusions: Early results **support** the feasibility and effectiveness **of thi**s national VHA teleconsultation and training program for transgender care. Lessons learned from the first group of learners have been applied to two concurrent groups with positive results.  Copyright 2015, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2015. eid: 2-s2.0-84948766201
3. **Provider barriers to telemental health: Obstacles overcome, obstacles remaining**
Many providers are hesitant to use telemental health technologies. When providers are queried, various barriers are presented, such as the clinician's skepticism about the effectiveness of telemental health (TMH), viewing telehealth technologies as inconvenient, or reporting difficulties with medical reimbursement. Provider **support** for TMH is **critic**al to its diffusion because clinicians often serve as the **initi**al gatekeepers to telehealth implementation and program success. In this article, we address provider concerns in three broad domains: (1) personal barriers, (2) clinical workflow and technology barriers, and (3) licensure, credentialing, and reimbursement barriers. We found evidence that, although many barriers have been discussed in the literature for years, advancements in TMH have rapidly reduced obstacles for its use. Improvements include extensive opportunities for training, a growing evidence b**ase sup**porting positive TMH outcomes, and transformations in technologies that improve provider convenience and transmission quality. Recommendations for further change are discussed within each domain. In particular, it is important to grow and disseminate data underscoring the promise and effectiveness of TMH, integrate videoconferencing capabilities into electronic medical record platforms, expand TMH reimbursement, and modify licensure standards.  2013, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-84896552508

0. **The diffusion of telehealth in rural American Indian communities: A retrospective survey of key stakeholders**
Objective: Mental health issues are a serious concern for many American Indian Veterans, especially for post-traumatic stress disorder and related psychiatric conditions. Yet, acquiring mental health treatment can be a challenge in Native communities where specialized services are largely unavailable. Consequently, telehealth is increasingly being suggested as a way to expand healthcare access on or near reservation lands. In this study, we wanted to understand the factors affecting the **diffus**ion of telehealth clinics that provided mental health care to rural, American Indian Veterans. Materials and Methods: We surveyed 39 key **person**nel and stakeholders who were involved in the decision-making process, technological infrastructure, and implementation of three clinics. Using Roger Everet**t's Di**ffusion Theory as a framework, we gathered information about specific tasks, factors hindering progress, **and pe**rsonal reactions to telehealth both before and after implementation. Results: Many participants expressed initial concerns about using telehealth; however, most became positive over time. Factors that influenced participants' viewpoint largely included patient and staff feedback and witnessing the fulfillment of a community health need. The use of outside information to support the implementation of the clin**ics an**d personal champions also showed considerable influence in the clinics' success. Conclusion: The findings presented here address critical gaps in our understanding of tel**ehealt**h diffusion and inform research strategies regarding the cultural issues and outcomes related to telemental **health servic**es. Information contained in this report serves as a long overdue guide for developing telemental health programs and policies among American Indians, specifically, and rural populations in general.  2012 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-84856690652
1. **Soldiers' personal technologies on deployment and at home**
Objective: **Person**al technologies such as smartphones, computers, and gaming devices, are ubiquitous in the civilian world. Consequently they represent ideal vehicles for disseminating psychological and other health resources and interventions. However, almost nothing is known ab**out pe**rsonal technology use in the U.S. military. We conducted the most comprehensive survey to date of the use, availability, and n**eed fo**r personal technologies by U.S. military service members. Our survey asked detailed questions about computers and the Internet, phones and smartphones, other mobile or portable technologies, gaming devices, and TV and video media used during **deploy**ment and at permanent duty station or home. Materials and Methods: We collected data by paper-and-pencil survey in 2010 and 2011 from 331 active Army service members at a processing and registration center in a large military installation in the western United States. Two cohorts were surveyed: Soldiers who had previously b**een de**ployed to a warzone and soldiers who had nev**er bee**n deployed. Results and Conclusion: We measured hi**gh rat**es of personal technology use by service members at home across all **popular** electronic media. Soldiers at home essentially resembled civilian consumers in their use** of pop**ular technologies. Some technologies, including the Internet, gaming, and TV, were wi**despre**ad on deployment. Others, most notably cellphones, were more restricted by availability, connectivity, opportunity, and military regulation in the warzone. Results will enable researchers and technology developers target their efforts on the most promis**ing and** popular technologies for psychological health in the military.

0. **Enchantment in psychiatric medicine**
Max Weber's 1918 essay Science as a Vocation posits that increasing scientific knowledge has contributed to a disenchantment of the natural world. His argument has implications for **medicin**e, an applied science aimed at the improvement of health, including psychiat**ric med**icine. Using Weber's argument, this paper discusses the ambivalent relationship psychiatry has with technology. On one hand, based on the historical roots of the specialty and the influence of psychodynamic psychotherapy, psychiatrists believe themselves to be masters of the invisible space between physicians and their patients. They claim to have the skills and insight that enable them to establish a unique kind of relationship in which communication not only allows them to diagnose, but also to heal through a variety of psychotherapeutic techniques. As a result, many psychiatrists are wary of the introduction of technology into therapeutic setting and the potential for this type of communication to be disrupted or diminished in value, often basing their concern on the ways in which technology has been witnessed to be disenchanting in other medical specialties. On the other hand, others see the future practice of psychiatry best guided through whole-hearted embrace of brain-based medical technology, which has been stunted by the complexity of the brain and relative lack of research funding compared to other medical specialties. This discussion within the field is timely, as on the horizon lies the holy grail of technological advancement for psychiatric practice: definitive biomarkers to diagnose mental illness and provide individualized treatments.  2019 Elsevier B.V. eid: 2-s2.0-85073722642
1. **Cost-effectiveness of Synchronous vs. Asynchronous Telepsychiatry in Prison Inmates With Depression [Costo-efectividad de telepsiquiatra sincrnica frentea asincrnica parapersonas condepresin privadas delalibertad]**
Introduction Telepsychiatry is defined as the use of information and communication technology (ICT) in providing remote psychiatric services. Telepsychiatry is applied using two types of communication: **synchron**ous (real time) and** **async**hron**ous (store and forward). Objective To determine the **cost**-effectivene**ss of a **synchronous and** an async**hronous telepsychiatric model in prison inmate patients with symptoms of depression. Method**s A **cost-effectiveness study was performed on a population consisting of 157patients from the Establecimiento Penitenciario y Carcelario de Mediana Seguridad de Manizales, Colombia. The sample was determined by applying Zung self-administered surveys for depression (1965) and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), the latter being the tool used for the comparison. Results Initial Hamilton score, arrival time, duration of system downtime, and clinical effectiveness variables had normal distributions (P>.05). There were significant differences (P<.001) betwe**en c**are costs for the different models, showing th**at t**he mean cost**** of the** a**synchronous mod**el is le**ss than synchronous model, **and** ma**king t**he asynchro**nous** model more cost-effectiv**e. **Con**clusio**ns The asynchronou**s mo**del is the most cost-effective model of telepsychiatry care for patients with depression admitted to a detention centre, according to the results of **clin**ical effectiveness, cost measurement, and patient satisfaction.  2016 Asociacin Colombiana de Psiquiatra eid: 2-s2.0-84973590686
2. **Asynchronous Telepsychiatry: A Component of Stepped Integrated Care**
Objective: Integrated behavioral healthcare models typically involve a range of consultation options for mental healthcare. **A**synchron****ous telepsychiatry (ATP) consults may be an additional potential choice, so we are conducting a 5-year clinical trial comparing ATP w**ith sync**hronous telepsychiatry (STP) consultations. Methods: Patients referred by primary care providers are randomly assigned to one of the two treatment groups, ATP or STP. Clinical outcome, satisfaction, and economic data are being collected from patients for 2 years at 6-month intervals. Results: Baseline characteristics for the first 158 patients and case examples of ATP are presented. Conclusion: Implementing ATP in existing integrated behavioral healthcare models could make mental healthcare more **effici**ent.  Copyright 2018, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-85046971165
3. **PsychVACS: A system for asynchronous telepsychiatry**
Objective: To describe the technical development of an **a**synchron****ous telepsychiatry application, the Psychiatric **Video** Archiving and Communication System. Methods: A client-server application was developed in Visual Basic.Net with Microsoft SQL database as the backend. It includes the capability of stor**ing v**ideo-recorded psychiatric interviews and manages the workflow of the system with automated messaging. Results: Psyc**hiatr**ic Video Archiving and Communication System has been used to conduct the first ever series** of async**hronous telepsychiatry consultations worldwide. A review of the software application and the process as part of this project has led to a number of improvements that are being implemented in the next version, which is being written in Java. Conclusions: This is the first description of** the **use of video recorded dat**a in an** a**sync**hronous tele**medicin**e application. Primary care providers and consulting psychiatrists have found it easy to work with and a valuable resource to increase the availability of psychiatric consultation in remote rural locations.  2011, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-79957603064
4. **Disruptive innovation: The future of healthcare?**
The traditional face-to-face doctor-patient relationship is the core of conventional medical practice. One key aspect of this changing relationship is the increasing dependency on **a**synchron****ous data collection in clinical consultations. Such electronic communications and data streams may be numeric, text-based, audio, digitized still pictures, **video** and radiologic, as well as emanating from multiple medical devices. Wh**ile async**hronous **medicin**e may be established in specialties like radiology and dermatology, there is little research regarding the** use of** a**sync**hron**ous med**icine in a**reas of** medicine that traditionally rely on the physical doctor-patient interaction such as primary car**e, inte**rnal medicine, geriatrics, and psychiatry. The practice of psychiatry stands out as a discipline that is highly dependent on the quality of the physical meeting between the doctor and the patient, yet even in this specialty it is possible** to uti**li**ze** a**syn**chronous medicine for some types of psychiatric** consul**ta**ti**on**s. **Asynchronous medicine has the potential to be significantly disruptive to our current healthcare processes, as well as more clinically and economically **effici**ent.

5. **Cost analysis of store-and-forward telepsychiatry as a consultation model for primary care**
Store-and-forward telepsychiatry, or **a**synchron****ous telepsychiatry (ATP), which allows clinical data, including **video** to be collected to be reviewed at a later time by a specialist, has been described as a feasible alternative to real-time telepsychiatry,** or sync**hronous telepsychiatry (STP), as a consultation model for primary care. In theory, ATP should be economically more **cost**-effective than STP due to the increased flexibility of patient data collection and the substitution of the time of specialists with that of lo**wer-**cost providers. The aim of this study was to conduct a retros**pect**ive cost-analysis comparing ATP with STP and traditional in-person psychiatric consultations in the primary care setting. One hundred and twenty five ATP consultations were performed and fixed a**nd m**arginal costs were calculated for each model using inputs su**ch a**s equipment costs, time spent by providers and support staff, and hourly **sala**ries. The fixed costs were $7,000 and $20,000 for A**TP a**nd STP and marginal costs were $68.18, $107.50, and $96.36, respectively, for the three groups. STP was the most expensive of the three types of consult**atio**ns. ATP became the most cost-effective of the three models beyond **249 **consultations. The marginal cost savings of **ATP **were due to substitution of low-cost providers for specialists. ATP represents a potential disruptive healthcare process that could allow more affordable care to be delivered to a larger population of patients. A full accounting of ATP's **effici**ency will require** fur**ther studies, including prospective cost-benefit analyses from the perspectives of the patient, provider, and society.  2012 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-84856731575

0. **Women's use of online resources and acceptance of e-mental health tools during the perinatal period**
Objectives The women's professional help-seeking rate for **perinat**al depression is low, despite the prevalent and disabling nature of this condition. Therefore, new approaches should be implemented to increase women's access and **util**ization of treatment resources, namely e-mental health tools. This study aimed to characterize women's current pattern of use of online resources for mental heal issues and women's acceptance of e-mental health tools during **the per**inatal **period**, and to investigate its main determinants. Methods This study used an online cross-sectional survey that was completed by 546 women dur**ing the** perina**tal pe**riod. Results 31.3% had prior knowledge of websites targeting mental health illness. Women presenting an actual need for help (i.e., a positive screen for depression) reported greater use of online resources and greater engagement in e-health behaviors related to mental health (d=0.460.61), and being more accepting of e-mental health tools, particularly of informative websites. Women's perceptions concerning the e-mental tools were found to predict their intentions to use them. Conclusions The results seem to globally support Portuguese women's acceptance of e-mental health tools. To improve the level of acceptance, women should be involved as stakeholders in the development of new e-mental health tools and provided with specific information before th**eir **utilization.  2016 eid: 2-s2.0-84982824306
1. **Evaluating the promise of health IT to enhance/expand the reach of mental health services**
Objective: A growing number of health information technologies (HIT) are being developed and tested to address mental health conditions. HIT includes Internet and smartphone programs or apps, text messaging protocols and telepsychiatry. We reviewed the **promis**e and evidence that HIT can expand access to mental health care and reduce disparities in use of services across groups in need. Conclusions: Limited **reach** of mental health services is a pervasive problem in the United States, and solving it will require innovations that enable us to extend our clini**cal r**each into underserved populations without significantly expanding our workforce. In theory, HIT can extend access to mental health care in several ways: by enhanc**ing t**he reach to priority populations, addressing system capacity issues, supporting training, improving clinical decision making, lowering the "consumer's threshold" for treatment, delivering preventiv**e ment**al health services, speeding innovation and adoption and reducing cost barriers to treatment. At present, evidence is limited, and research is needed, focusing on consumer engagement strategies, the benefits and harms of HIT for the therapeutic relationship and the comparative effectiveness of various HIT alternatives.  2013 Elsevier Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-84879461048

Demographic and clinical characteristics indicate high acceptance of e-mail by outpatients with anorexia nervosa. Patients **report** that frequent e-mail contact provides them with the experience of greater contact with their clinicians and requires them to be more attentive to therapeutic tasks. Routine logs of calorie counts and symptoms may be communicated by e-mail on a frequent basis, freeing up office time for better discussions. Informal investigations in a **case** series of outpatients with anorexia nervosa suggest that e-mail can offer a useful adjunct to treatment. No adverse consequences have been experienced. Clinicians using e-mail in this fashion must attend to legal and ethical concerns about e-mail communication.

1. **Recurrent hypoglycemia, a rare case of insulin autoimmune syndrome in a young African American male**
Insulin autoimmune syndrome (IAS)is an uncommon cause of spontaneous hypoglycemia from hyperinsulinemia due to autoantibodies against endogenous insulin (Jian-Ping Chu, 2016). These individuals have no prior exposure to exogenous insulin. We **report** a **case** of a 35-year-old African American male, who **present**ed to Vaughn Regional Medical Center in Selma, AL, after he was found to have seizures from hypoglycemia, with a blood sugar of 63** on pre**sentation. He was never diagnosed with diabetes in the past, nor did he have a history of seizure disorder. He continued to be hypoglycemic during the **initi**al period of his hospital stay. His fasting insulin level was 27 mIU/l (normal is less than 25, with presence of insulin autoantibodies (IAA), and a negative workup otherwise. This led us to include IAS as one of our differentials for his hypoglycemia.  2019 eid: 2-s2.0-85066323409
2. **Acute laryngeal dystonia: A persisting psychiatric emergency**
Objective: Acute laryngeal dystonia is one of the most life-threatening medication side effects in psychiatry. It is **rare** and predominately caused by the use of antipsychotics in at-risk individuals. Within days of a patient's **initi**al **present**ation, several antipsychotics can be administered for the purposes of acute sedation and ongoing pharmacotherapy. In this ****case** **report****, we describe a 27-year-old at-risk male, who developed acute laryngeal dystonia in the context of antipsychotic polypharmacy. Conclusion: Clinicians should take into account recent sedation and ongoing antipsychotic use in patients at risk of developing acute laryngeal dystonia. Awareness of this condition and prompt treatment with parenteral anticholinergic medication can be lifesaving.

0. **Attitudes Towards Implementation of Store-and-Forward Telemental Health in Humanitarian Settings: Survey of Syrian Healthcare Providers**
Store-and-forward (SandF) telemedicine is thought to be most applicable in humanitarian settings. Unlike other kinds of telemental health (TMH), SandF requires engagement and active **particip**ation from healthcare providers in submitting text or audio-video clinical material for consultations. To implement such consultative systems there is a need to gauge providers' attitudes towards this technology. Materials and Methods: An electronic survey was sent to Syrian healthcare providers (physicians and nonphysicians) who are affiliated with humanitarian nongovernmental organizations managing Syrians affected by war. After a description of what TMH and SandF a**re, part**icipants were asked about their attitudes towards such services. Results: Fifty-two providers responded to the electronic survey. Only results from providers inside Syria (n=30) are presented. The majority of respondents had no **experi**ence with TMH. Half of the providers believed that mental healthcare can be provided through SandF and that there would be a benefit from such services. Respondents reported that **cultur**al (68%), financial (84%), and **technic**al (80%) barriers do exist for such services. When asked, providers believed that patients would agree to be audiotaped (58%) for the purpose of SandF compared with being videotaped (15%) (p=0.007). Conclusions: Electronic surveys of healthcare workers in humanitarian settings are feasible. Providers in the Syrian humanitarian setting have lit**tle ex**perience in TMH; however, they are open to using an SandF service while acknowledg**ing cu**ltural, financial, **and tec**hnical barriers to the implementation.  2016 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-84954457631
1. **Reactions of psychiatric patients to telepsychiatry**
Telepsychiatry could offer a viable medical service to remote or isolated social communities if it does not generate adverse reactions such as delusional ideation, particularly in patients in settlements without adequate exposure to mainstream **cultur**e and internet. We examined subjective reactions to telepsychiatry of randomly selected 84 psychiatric patients from remote locations in Ontario, Canada. They rated the quality of their teleconferencing sessions via 10 item questionnaire and were asked about advantages and disadvantages of telepsychiatry. The majority of patients indicated that they were able to communicate as if physically present (92.9%) and were **comfort**able with telepsychiatric service (95.2%). They found the sessions as beneficial as direct meetings with their psychiatrist (84.5%) and would use this service again (98.8%). There were no instances of telepsychiatry being associated with adverse reactions in patients from remote communities with inadequate exposure to modern mainstr**eam cu**lture and internet.  R.

2. **Telepsychiatry services for Korean immigrants**
Asian Americans often face **cultur**al and language barriers when obtaining mental health treatment. With the small number of Asian mental health providers, it is difficult to ensure the linguistic and ethnic matching of providers and patients. Telepsychiatry holds great promise to address the unique needs of Asian Americans. We developed a project to establish telepsychiatry services that connect **Korean** mental health patients in Georgia with a linguistically **and cu**lturally **compet**ent psychiatrist in California and assessed the level of acceptability of psychiatric treatment via real-time teleconferencing among these patients. Upon the completion of the program, 16 patients (5 men, 11 women) completed a questionnaire that measured their acceptability of the telepsychiatry service. The findings indicate a high level of acceptance of the program am**ong Ko**rean patients. The quantitative and qualitative data show that they especially apprecia**ted th**e cultural sensitivity of the consultation and the **comfort**able interaction with the provider. However, challenges such as **technic**al issues of teleconferencing may negatively affect the quality of the clinical interaction. Our study expands the knowledge base regarding the acceptability of such services to a **popul**ation that **experi**ences disparities in mental health care. Future research should extend telepsychiatry services to other As**ian p**opulation groups t**hat ex**perience lower access to mental health services.  2012, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-84871264338
3. **Acceptability of telepsychiatry in American Indians**
Telepsychiatry differs from in-person treatment in terms of its delivery mechanism, and this dissimilarity may increase **cultur**al differences between the provider and the patient. Beca**use cu**ltural **compet**ence and identification can impact **patient satisfact**ion ratings, we wanted to explore **whethe**r cultural differences in our study **popul**ation influenced telepsychiatric and in-person interviews. Here, we compared the acceptability of conducting psychiatric assessments with rural American Indian veterans by real-time videoconferencing versus inperson administration. The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IIIR (SCID) was given to **particip**ants both in person and by telehealth. A process measure was created to ass**ess part**icipants' responses to the interview type concerning the usability of the technology, the perceptions of the interviewee/interviewer inter**action**, the cultu**ral co**mpetence of the interview, and satisfaction with the interview and the interview process. The process measure was administered to 53 American Indian Vietnam veterans both in-person and by real-time interactive videoconferencing. Mean responses were compared f**or each **participant. Interviewers were also asked several of the same quest**ions as **the participants; answers were compared to th**e corres**ponding participant responses. Overall, telepsychiatry was well received and comparable in level of patient **comfort**, sa**tisfac**tion, and cultural acceptance to in-person interviews. We also found evidence to suggest that interviewers so**metimes **interpreted participant satisfaction as significantly **less fav**orable than the participants actually responded. Despite the potential of videoconfe**rencin**g to increase cultural differences, we found that it is an acceptable means for psychiatric assessment of American Indian veterans and presents an opportunity to provide mental health services t**o a p**opulation that might otherwise not have access.

4. **Telepsychiatry and cultural barrier in Korea**
This research was performed in order to empirically prove that telepsychiatry can result in overcoming of the Confucian **cultur**al barrier which discouraged **Korean** patients from seeking psychiatric care. The Confuc**ian cu**lture of Korea forces its members to observe absolute conformity to the social norm. In this **kind o**f culture it is very hard to admit one's mental illness and to seek medical help. Thus telepsychiatry might be a good alternative to face-to-face meeting-based psychiatry es**pecial**ly in culturally inhibitive places such as Korea. We conducted a telepsychiatry **experi**ment using Instant Messenger with 93 volunteers who had** an ex**perience of seeing a psychiatrist in person. The result shows that people tend to think that telepsychiatry allowed them to break out o**f the **Confucian cultural protocol which put heavy emphasis on avoiding any irregular thought. eid: 2-s2.0-77953016400

2. **From Digital Mental Health Interventions to Digital Addiction: Where the Two Fields Converge**
Scientific **literatur**e from the **last** two decades indicates that, when it comes to mental health, technology is presented either as panacea or anathema. This is partly because researchers, too frequently, have planted themselves either in the field of digital mental health interventions (variably called telepsychiatry, digital therapeutics, computerized therapy, etc.), or in that of the problems arising from technology, with little cross-fertilization between the two. Yet, a closer look at the two fields reveals unifying themes that underpin both the advantages and dangers of technology in mental health. This article discusses five such themes. First, the breakneck pace of technology evolution keeps digital mental health interventions updated and creates more potentially problematic activities, leaving researchers perennially behind, so new technologies become outdated by the time they are studied. Second, the freedom of creating and using technologies in a regulatory vacuum has led to proliferation and choice, but also to a Wild-West online environment. Third, technology is an open window to access information, but also to compromise privacy, with serious implications for online psychology and digital mental health interventions. Fourth, weak bonds characterize online interactions, including those between therapists and patients, contributing to high attrition from digital interventions. Finally, economic analyses of technology-enabled care may show good value for money, but often fail to capture the true **cost**s of technology, a fact that is mirrored in other online activities. The article ends with a call for collaborations between two interrelated fields that have beentill nowmutually insular.  Copyright  2020 Aboujaoude and Gega. eid: 2-s2.0-85079160741

Background: In the **age** of online communication, psychiatric care can now be provided via videoconferencing technologies. While virtual visits as a part of telepsychiatry and telemental health provide a highly efficient and beneficial modality of care, the implementation of virtual visits requires attention to quality and safety issues. As practitioners continue to **util**ize this technology, issues of clinician licensing, treatment outcomes of virtual visits versus in-person visits, and **cost** offset require ongoing study. Methods: This review provides an overview of the topics of technology, legal and regulatory issues, clinical issues, **and **cost savings as they relate to practicing psychiatry and psychology via virtual visits in an **academ**ic medical center. We review the telepsychiatry/telemental health effectiveness **literatur**e from 2013 to the present. **Our liter**ature **search**es used the following terms: telemental health effective, telepsychiatry effective, telepsychiatry efficacy, and telemental health efficacy. Th**ese se**arches produced 58 articles, reduced to 16 when including only articles that address effectiveness of clinician-to-patient services. Results: The technological, legal, and regulatory issues vary from state to state and over time. The eme**rging **research addressing diverse populations and disorders provides strong evidence for the effectiveness of telepsyc**hiat**ry. Cost savings are difficult to precisely **determin**e and depend on the s**cope** of the cost and benefit measured.

1. **Locum Tenens and Telepsychiatry: Trends in Psychiatric Care**
Abstract Background: There is a national short**age** of psychiatrists, and according to nationally available data, it is projected to get worse. Locum tenens psychiatry and telepsychiatry are two ways to fill the s**hor**tages of psychiatric providers that exist in many areas in the United States. Employment and salary data in these areas can be used to illuminate current trends and anticipate future solutions to the problem of increasing demand for, and decreasing supply of, psychiatrists in the United States. Materials and Methods: A **search** was conducted of the **literatur**e and **relev**ant Web sites, including PubMed, Google Scholar, and www.google.com, as well as information obtained from locum tenens and telepsychiatry organizations. Results: There is a dearth of data on the use of locum tenens in the field of psychiatry, with little available prior to 2000 and few published studies since then. The majority of the data available are survey data from commercial entities. These data show trends toward increasing demand for psychiatry along with increasing salaries and indicate the **util**ization of telepsychiatry and locum tenens telepsychiatry is increasing. The published **academ**ic data that are available show that although locum tenens psychiatry is slightly inferior to routine psychiatric care, telepsychiatry is generally equivalent to face-to-face care. Conclusions: One can anticipate that as the nation**al **shortage of psychiatrists is expected to accelerate, use of both locum tenens and telepsychiatry may also continue to increase. Telepsychiatry offers several pos**sib**le advantages, including lower **cost**, longer-term services, quality of care, and models that can extend psychiatric services. If current trends continue, systems that demand face-to-face psychiatry may find themselves paying higher fees for locum tenens psychiatrists, whereas others may employ psychiatrists more efficiently with telepsychiatry.

2. **The effectiveness of telemental health: A 2013 review**
Introduction: The effectiveness of any new technology is typically measured in order to **determin**e whether it successfully achieves equal or superior objectives over what is currently offered. Re**search** in telemental health - in this article mainly referring to telepsychiatry and psychological services - has advanced rapidly since 2003, and a new effectiveness review is needed. Materials and Methods: The authors reviewed the published **literatur**e to synthesize information on what is and what is not effective related to telemental health. Terms for **the se**arch included, but were not limited to, telepsychiatry, effectiveness, mental health, e-health, videoconferencing, telemedicine, **cost**, access, and international. Results: Telemental health is effective for diagnosis and assessment across many populations (adult, child, geriatric, and ethnic) and for disorders in many settings (emergency, home health) and appears to be comparable to in-person care. In addition, this review has identified new models of care (i.e., collaborative care, asynchronous, mobile) with equally positive outcomes. Conclusions: Telemental health is effective and increases access to care. Future directions suggest the need for** more **research on service models, specific disorders, the issues **relev**ant to culture and langu**age**, **and **cost.  2013, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-84896551334

0. **Resident Evaluation of a Required Telepsychiatry Clinical Experience**
Objective: The authors explored **resid**ent **experi**ences of telepsychiatry clinical training. This paper describes an analysis of evaluation forms completed by psychia**try r**esidents following a required train**ing ex**perience in telepsychiatry. Methods: Retrospective numeric and narrative data were collected from 2005 to 2012. Using a five-point Likert-type scale (1 = strongly disagree and 5 = strongly **agree**), residents ranked the session based on the following characteristics: the **overal**l experience, **interest** in participating in telepsychiatry in the future, understanding service provision to underserved areas, telepsychiatry as mode of service delivery, and the unique aspects of telepsychiatry work. The authors also conducted a content analysis of narrative comments in response to open-ended questions about the positive and negative aspects of t**he tra**ining experience. Results: In a**ll, 8**8 % of residents completed (n = 335) an anonymous evaluation following their participation in telepsychiatry consultation sessions. Numeric results were mostly positive and ind**icated** that the experience **was inte**resting and enjoyable, e**nhanced **interest in participating in telepsychiatry in the future, and increased understanding of providing psychiatric services to underserved communities. Narrative data demonstrated that the most valuable aspects of training included the knowledge acquired in terms of establishing rapport and engaging with patients, using the technology, working collaboratively, identifying different approaches used, and awareness of the compl**exity** of cases. Resident desire for more training of this nature was prevalent, specifically a wish for more detail, additional time for discussion and debriefing, and further explanation of the unique aspects of telepsychiatry as mode of delivery. Conclusions: More evaluation of telepsychiatry training, elective or required, is needed. The context of this training offered potential side benefits of learning about interprofessional and collaborative care for the underserved.  2015 Academic Psychiatry. eid: 2-s2.0-84959335862
1. **Telemedicine interest for routine follow-up care among neurology patients in Arkansas**
Background: Teleneurology in Arkansas has been used primarily for management of acute stroke with a state-funded hub-and-spoke model allowing physicians at rural hospitals to access vascular neurologists in time to facilitate tissue plasminogen activator **administr**ation. Routine neurologic care has been provided only in small pilot studies. We wished to determine patient **interest** in participating in teleneurology for routine follow-up visits as well as demographic and medical factors associated w**ith inte**rest. Materials and Methods: New and established patients of the Neurology Outpatient Clinic at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) were surveyed between March 2011 and December 2012 to asses**s their **interest in participating in teleneurology as well as potential factors associated** with th**eir interest. Results: Of 1,441 responde**nts, 52.**4% were interested in tel**emedicin**e. Of th**ose inte**rested versus uninterested in telemedicine, respectively, 68.9% versus 36.32% traveled more than 1 h to the clinic, 64.7% versus 35.3% had difficulty secondary to neurological conditions, 22.6% versus 6.8% had missed medical appointments due to travel problems, and 43.1% versus 9.4% had travel-imposed financial hardship**. Conclu**sions: Telemedicine interest for routine follow-up visits was strong among patients at the UAMS Neurology Outpatient Clinic. Fac**tors pos**itively associated with interest included long travel distances, travel expenses, and transportation difficulties. These results suggest that implementing a telemedicine program for follow-up visits would be acceptable to neurology patients for routine ongoing care.

2. **Connecting to the future: Telepsychiatry in postgraduate medical education**
Objective: This study characterized and examined factors influencing psychiatry **resid**ents' and fellows' **interest**, **exposur**e, and future plans to use telepsychiatry. Subjects and Methods: A 17-item electronic survey was distributed to 485 psychia**try r**esidency and fellowship programs in the United States. Each program director or **administr**ator was asked to voluntarily distribute the survey to his or her trainees. Chi-squared tests were performed to test differences in proportions. Stepwise multivariate logistic regression was used to model outcomes** of inte**rest. Results: In total, 283 respondents completed the survey. A majority of responden**ts were **interested in telepsychiatry and felt that it was an important part of training. Of the 50 respondents who had clini**cal exp**osure to telepsychiatry and completed the survey, most reported that their **experi**ence incr**eased th**eir interest level, and two-thirds reported having either a one-time encounter or less than 6 h of multiple pati**ent ex**periences via telepsychiatry. C**linical** exposure to telepsychiatry was significantly related to level of training (p=0.001) and program **locat**ion (p=**0.005**). Residents in their **postgradu**ate year (PGY) 4 or fellowship were 2.6 times more likely to be exposed to clinical telepsychiatry t**han P**GY 1-3 residents (95% confidence interval [**CI] 1**.41-4.95). Residents and fellows in rural programs were 4.3 times more likely to be exposed than those in urban or suburban settings (95% CI 1.07-17.28). Factors affecting trainees' plans to use telepsychiatry in their future practice include prog**ram l**ocatio**n (p=0.0**13) and intere**st le**vel (p<0.001). Residents and fellows i**n rur**al locations were 9.3 times more likely to report future plans to use telepsychiatry (95% CI 1.88-45.71). Conclusions: There is a p**racti**ce g**ap betw**e**en** resident interest a**nd resi**dent exposure to telepsychiatry. Training programs should consider incorporating a brief telepsychiatry** expe**rience t**o fulfil**l both resident interest and the growing demand for psychiatrists.  2013, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-84896551051
3. **Choosing psychiatry as a career: Motivators and deterrents at a critical decision-making juncture**
Objective: To examine factors influencing the choice of psychiatry as a career between **resid**ency program application and ranking decision making. Methods: Using an online questionnaire, applicants to the largest Canadian psychia**try r**esidency program were surveyed about the impact of various factors on their ultimate decision to enter psy**chiat**ry residency training. Results: Applicants reported that patient-related stigma was a motivator in considering psychiatry as a career, but that negative comments from colleagues, friends, and family about choosing psychiatry was a deterrent. Training program length, limited treatments, and insufficient clerkship **exposur**e were noted as deterrents to choosing psychiatry, though future job prospects, the growing role of neuroscience, and diagnostic **complex**ity positively influenced choosing psychiatry as a specialty. Research and elective time away opportunities were deemed relatively unimportant to ranking decisions, compared with more highly weighted factors, such as program flexibility, emphasis on psychotherapy, service-training balance, and training program **locat**ion. Most applicants also reported continuing to fine tune ranking decisions between the application and ranking submission deadline. Conclusions: Stig**ma, exp**osure to psychiatry, diagnos**tic com**plexity, and an encouraging job market were highlighted as positive influences on the choice to enter** psyc**hiatry residency. Interview and information days represent opportunities for continued targeted recruitment activity** for **psychiatry residency programs. eid: 2-s2.0-84905994899
4. **Defining competencies for the practice of telepsychiatry through an assessment of resident learning needs Approaches to teaching and learning**
Background: A foundational assessment of learning needs is missing from previous reports of telepsychiatry curricula. We used an in-depth needs assessment to identify specific skills required for the practice of effective telepsychiatry, and provide an evidence base to guide the development of telepsychiatry curricula in **postgradu**ate psychiatry training. Many of these skills set telepsychiatry apart from practice in traditional face-to-face clinical settings, or result from adaptations to clinical practice to meet the needs of a telepsychiatry interface in patient care. Methods: We used a qualitative, modified grounded theory approach to gain insight into areas of importance for telepsychiatry training** in postg**raduate psychiatry **resid**ency. 16 interviews of faculty **and r**esidents (9 and 7 interviews, respectively), allowed participants to reflect on their **experi**ences in telepsychiatry. Data were then thematically analyzed. Results: Interview respondents identified important aspects of the context for telepsychiatry training; the skills required to competently practice telepsychiatry; and the desired teaching and learning methods for acquiring these skills. Specific domains of competency were identified: Technical skills; assessment skills; relational skills and communication; collaborative and interprofessional skills; **administr**ative skills; medico-legal skills; community psychiatry and community-specific knowledge; cultural psychiatry skills, including knowledge of Indigenous cultures; and, knowledge of health systems. The skills identified in this study map well to competency- based **medical educ**ation frameworks. Conclusions: Telepsychiatry is increasingly being adopted as a solution to health systems problems such as regional disparities in access to care, and it requires explicit competency development. Ensuring adequate and quality **exposur**e to telepsychiatry** duri**ng residency training could positively impact our health systems and health equity.  2016 Crawford et al. eid: 2-s2.0-84956888493

0. **Telepsychology: A Primer for Counseling Psychologists **
Telepsychology is having a profound influence on professional practice. Currently, however, many **psychologist**s lack the requisite knowledge and skill to provide **ethic**al and competent telepractice services. Moreover, the field has lagged in developing the educational and supervised experiences required to achieve competency. Yet, there is great opportunity as well. The purpose of this article is to identify the natural integration of the pillars of counseling psychology with the major domains of telepractice and to link telepractice to the values and mission of counsel**ing psycholo**gists. We **present** aspects of telepsychology includ**ing e**thical and legal factors, asynchronous and synchronous practice, and group-**focu**sed practice along with technologies and the rules that govern them. We also describe interjurisdictional practice, and introduce a proposed curriculum based upon the benchmark competencies for infusion of telepsychology into training across the professional lifespan.

2. **Digitising psychiatry? Sociotechnical expectations, performative nominalism and biomedical virtue in (digital) psychiatric praxis**
Digital artefacts and infrastructures have been **present**ed as ever more urgent and necessary for mental health research and practice. Telepsychiatry, **mHealth**, and now digital psychiatry have been promoted in this regard, among other endeavours. Smartphone apps have formed a particular **focu**s of promissory statements regarding the improvement of epistemic and clinical work in psychiatry. This article contextualises and historicises some of these developments. In doing so, I show how purportedly novel fields have been constituted in part through practices of **perform**ative nominalism (whereby articulations of a neologism in relation to established and recent developments participate in producing the referent of the new term). Central to this has been implicit and explicit extolment of what I term biomedical virtues in public-facing and professionally orientated discourse. I document how emphases on various virtues have shifted with the attention of psychiatry to different digital modalities, culminating with knowledge-production in mental health as one signific**ant **focus.  2018 The Author.

3. **Capacity, consent and electroconvulsive therapy: A qualitative and cross-sectional study**
Background: Mental capacity based mental health legislation has been proposed, but its potential impact on practice has not been described. Aims: To describe the extent to which mental capacity based law might change prescriptions of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in England and Wales. Method: A qualitative study using **focu**s groups and semi-structured interviews of psychiatrists, was followed by a cross sectional study of 186 consultant psychiatrists. Results: Psychiatrists were divided in their management of detained but apparently competent patients refusing ECT. From the cross sectional survey, 15.9% reported having prescribed ECT in such patients, but some expressed views that the treatment was not acceptable under these circumstances. Conclusions: Mental capacity based legislation could limit the use of compulsory treatment to some individuals refusing treatment. However, it might equally lead to psychiatrists redefining their operational definitions of mental capacity. Declaration of interest: This study was funded by the Department of Health.

4. **Expanding our Reach: Telehealth and Licensure Implications for Psychologists**
This article discusses the background and history of the Association of State and Provincial Psychology Board's (ASPPB) Principles and Standards for Telepsychology. The Principles/Standards are described with comments on each one as they apply to the practice of telepsychology, and with a guide on how they coordinate with the American Psychological Association's Guidelines for the Practice of Telepsychology. Further, barriers to the interjurisdictional practice of telepsychology are reviewed and a proposed solution to them is **present**ed. The ASPPB psychology interjurisdictional compact, known as the PSYPACT is in process of being introduced as an effective vehicle for addressing these barriers.  2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York. eid: 2-s2.0-84949535290
5. **Towards learning organisations with telemedicine**
For the post-industrial society, the knowledge and information society, learning is an important activity. We speak about learning organisations and even a learning society. In healthcare dissemination of knowledge may be a tool for improving patient care. Working with telemedicine has been proposed to result in learning, but research on this is limited. To investigate learning in telemedicine a study was **perform**ed with qualitative interviews of 30 persons working with telepsychiatry, teledermatology, a telepathology frozen-section service, and teleotolaryngology. The results clearly show that working with telemedicine provides learning. More than 80% of the respondents revealed that they had learnt something new by using telemedicine and had improved their knowledge of their specialty as well as other areas. All GPs said they had learnt something new, as well as nurses, **psychologist**s, other categories of personnel, and even medical specialists. When all within psychiatry report that they have learnt something new the future learning potential of telemedicine looks promising for psychiatry. Two-thirds of the respondents could not tell that the learning made t**hem per**form tasks for which they previously needed assistance, but the answers may have been dependent on the type of telemedical work and the educational background of the respondents. Two-thirds of the respondents thought that something more could be done in telemedical work to promote their own learning, which shows the clear potential for learning by telemedicine. To start working with telemedicine initial instruction seems to be sufficient; a more extensive training programme appears unnecessary. In future with many applications of telemedicine implemented, healthcare organisations may become important arenas for learning and leaders will have to **focu**s on learning.

6. **Prospective acceptance of distinct mobile mental health features in psychiatric patients and mental health professionals**
Background: Despite numerous mobile health (**mHealth**) applications available, current impact on mental healthcare is low. Users face overwhelming variety of applications and sensors. Evidence for distinct features' effectiveness is largely lacking. Along with technical feasibility and data security issues, readiness and preferences of patients predetermine engagement and impact** of mHe**alth in psychiatry. Objective: We aimed to assess the prospective attitudes of psychiatric patients and mental health professionals (MHP) **towards** mHealth applications in general and with regard to distinct features. Methods: We conducted a survey entailing 486 subjects (297 MHP and 189 patients). Results: Professionals and patients indicate both, considerable acceptance and rejection for most features. Marked concerns across groups relate to data security in general. Actimetry and geotracking were considered particularly skeptical. Importantly, most patients prefer to be prompted timely about health status changes. Conclusion: Altogether, evidence indicates substantial **support** for mHealth features in mental healthcare despite considerable rejection of distinct features. We conclude that tighter collaboration between researchers, developers and clinicians must a**ddress **matching mHealth-apps to patients' needs. Improved information on potential risks and possibilit**ies ass**ociated with mHealth features is strongly indicated in MHP and psychiatric patients in order to reach an appropriately informed decision on individual involvement.  2018 Elsevier Ltd eid: 2-s2.0-85059267634
7. **Online counseling: An exploratory survey of Italian psychologists attitudes towards new ways of interaction**
Objective: Online counseling may be defined as an interaction between users and mental health professionals that takes place through computer mediated communication technology. This study aimed to investigate the attitudes of Italian **psychologist**s towards different aspects of online counseling provided via email, chat, forums, and videoconference. Method: An online questionnaire was administered to a sample of 289 licen**sed psycholo**gists in the Veneto Region (Italy) in order to collect opinions, preferences, and intentions to use online modalities, along with prior knowledge and practice experiences. Results: Only 18.3% of the respondents had previous experience with online counseling. Overall, the majo**rity of psyc**hologists (62.6%) were favorable towards online counseling, but they also had several reservations about the provision of online diagnosis and therapeutic interventions. Results showed a consistent lack of clarity regarding **ethic**al and penal issues concerning online modalities. Conclusions: More efforts must be directed to deepening the application of new technologies in the field of psychology in order to enable** an e**thical and professional practice of online counseling in Italy.  2017,  2017 Society for Psychotherapy Research. eid: 2-s2.0-85009200750
8. **Forensic Assessment via Videoconferencing: Issues and Practice Considerations**
Forensic assessment videoconferencing (VC) is gradually gaining popularity among forensic mental health practitioners. Given the profound impacts of the characteristics of VC on forensic assessment destined for courts, knowledge of and familiarity with the salient features of the technology and its application in forensic assessment is relevant so as to obviate any potential negative impact. The **present** study examines some issues as well as practice considerations that may help forensic **psychologist**s enhance the results of forensic assessments conducted with VC technology. Discussions and suggestions on how to advance forensic assessment via VC are offered. Copyright  Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. eid: 2-s2.0-84930885227

Palsbo SE. Medicaid payment for telerehabilitation. Arch Phys Med Rehabil 2004;85:1188-91. Objective To assess current payment practice for telerehabilitation in state Medicaid programs. Design Telephone survey. Setting State Medicaid programs. Participants State Medicaid directors. Interventions Not applicable. Main outcome measure Descriptive. Results Half of the 35 state Medicaid programs contacted reimbursed at least some telemedicine services other than radiology in 2002. The primary reason for reimbursing for telemedicine is to make services available when there is no local practitioner. Consultation and evaluation and management services were most likely to be reimbursed (12 states). Seven state programs reimbursed telepsychology, and 4 states reported reimbursing for telespeech and language pathology, physical therapy, or occupational therapy. Conclusions Telemedicine helps Medicaid programs deliver specialized care to locations with provider shortages. Telerehabilitation is not yet widespread, despite its potential benefit to people with disabilities who cannot travel to a clinic for rehabilitation therapy. Most Medicaid programs calculate the financial costs and patient benefits when considering payment policies, and about half of states require a state law to allow payment for telerehabilitation. Minnesota, Hawaii, and Nebraska, among the responding states, currently reimburse for telerehabilitation. Research is needed to evaluate the appropriateness of telerehabilitation for Medicaid beneficiaries.  2004 by the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine and the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation. eid: 2-s2.0-3242678150
10. **Attitudes Toward Psychological Telehealth: Current and Future Clinical Psychologists' Opinions of Internet-Based Interventions**
Objectives: The current study explored differences in acceptance of telehealth interventions amongst currently **licens**ed and future clinicians with a **focu**s on web camera-based intervention. The influence of theoretical orientation was also assessed. Method: An online survey assessed 717 participants comprising **409 li**censed **psychologist**s (40.8% female, mean age = 56.57, standard deviation [SD] = 11.01) and 308 doctoral-level students (78.9% female, mean age = 27.66, SD = 5.9) across domains of endorsement and rejection. Results: Binary logistic regression indicated no significant difference between cu**rrentl**y licensed and fut**ure psycholo**gists in their endorsement of telehealth modalities. Cognitive-behavioral, cognitive, behavioral, and **systems psyc**hologists were significantly more accepting of telehealth interventions than were dynamic/analytic or existential therapists. Conclusions: Increasing exposure to telehealth through education as well as continued research on efficacy for specific diagnos**es may help **psychologists to more effectively determine whether telehealth is the "best fit" for both clinician and client.  2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-84870919311
11. **Twenty-First Century Ethical Challenges for Psychology**
Foreseeable social and technological changes will force us to reevaluate our thinking about **ethic**ally appropriate ways to fulfill our mission of using psychology to advance human health and welfare in the twenty-first century. Three categories of challenge related to societal and technological changes have become particularly evident. First, increasing patterns of delivering services over substantial distances by electronic means (i.e., telepsychology) demand consideration. Second, we must parse **our e**thical obligations to individuals, to groups, and to society at large as our influence working behind the scenes as "invisible" **psychologist**s grows. Finally, as we witness the accelerating demise of psychiatry, we must take care not to follow a similar path. As we f**ace n**ew ethical challenges, we must continually ask ourselves where our responsibilities lie as individuals and as a profession. We must learn not to repeat the mistakes of the past and **focu**s instead on optimizing the future for a science and practice of psychol**ogy **focused on human health and welfare.  2007 American Psychological Association. eid: 2-s2.0-34548642366
12. **Delivery of evidence-based psychotherapy via video telehealth**
There has been increasing interest in using video telehealth to deliver evidence-based psychotherapies (EBPs). Telehealth may have numerous advantages over standard in-person care, including decreasing patients' and providers' costs and increasing system coverage area. However, little is known regarding the effectiveness of EBPs via video telehealth. This review had two goals, including a review of the existing literature and ongoing research on using video telehealth technologies to deliver EBPs as well as an informal survey of telehealth experts to discuss the special considerations and challenges **present** in adapting practices to video telehealth. Together, findings suggest that telehealth practices coul**d repre**sent an important component of the future of psychotherapy and clinical practice, especially in dissemination and implementation of EBPs in traditionally underserved areas and populations.  2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York (outside the USA). eid: 2-s2.0-84888199158

0. **The opportunity for telehealth to support neurological health care**
Neurological conditions affect one-third of **American**s and are some of the most prevalent health issues in the country. Many sufferers have difficulty accessing treatment, however, advances in technology may be able to support availability, affordability, and convenience of care through telehealth services. This review outlines the current state of telemedicine in neurological healthcare, **high**lighting evidence-based research and use cases for digital services. Details on expenses associated with managing certain well-known conditions are included to shed light on the financial burden of disease and how telehealth can contribute to cost savings for patients and providers. Finally, a discussion of current telehealth legislature gives additional perspective on regulatory dynamics experienced by different stakeholders in the field. Research supports telemedicine as a solution to enhance current care models given its many benefits, including efficient and clinically useful service delivery. This movement has the opportunity to help billions of individuals globally by acting as a mechanism to provide impactful and scalable neurological healthcare.

1. **Predicting engagement with an online psychosocial intervention for psychosis: Exploring individual- and intervention-level predictors**
Background: Individuals with psychosis demonstrate positive attitudes towards utilising digital technology in mental health treatment. Although preliminary research suggests digital interventions are feasible and acceptable in this population, little is known about how to best promote engagement with these resources. Candidate predictors include therapist support, sources of motivation and recovery style. Understanding what factors predict engagement will aid more effective **design** and implementation of digital interventions to improve clinical benefits. Objective: This study aimed to investigate demographic, psychological, and treatment variables that predict overall and type of engagement with a psychosocial, online intervention for individuals with psychosis. Methods: Ninety-eight participants with a history of psychosis were given access to a web program containing modules on self-management and recovery, which they were asked to use flexibly at their own pace. Activity was automatically logged by the **system**. Baseline measures of demographics, recovery style and motivation were administered, and participants were randomised to receive either website access alone, or website access plus weekly, asynchronous emails from an online coach over 12 weeks. Log and baseline assessment data were used in negative binomial regressions to examine predictors of depth and breadth of use over the intervention period. A logistic regression was used to examine the impact of predictor variables on usage profiles (active or passive). Results: Depth and breadth of engagement were positively predicted by receiving email support, low levels of externally controlled motivations for website use, older age, and having a tertiary education. There was a significant interaction between level of controlled motivation and condition (+/email) on breadth and depth of engagement: receiving asynchronous emails was associated with increased engagement for individuals with low, but not **high**, levels of externally controlled motivations. Receiving email support and more autonomous motivations for treatment predicted more active use of the website. Conclusions: Asynchronous email support can promote engagement with online interventions for individuals with psychosis, potentially enabling self-management of illness and improving clinical outcomes. However, those using online interventions due to external motivating factors, may have low levels of engagement with the intervention, irrespective of coaching provided. These findings may gu**ide de**sign and implementation of future online interventions in this population.  2019 The Authors eid: 2-s2.0-85070855127
2. **Tower of Babel Problem in Telehealth: Addressing the Health Information Exchange Needs of the North Carolina Statewide Telepsychiatry Program (NC-STeP)**
Telepsychiatry is a viable option for providing psychiatric care to those who are currently underserved or who lack access to services. While the current technology is adequate for most uses, and continues to advance, there remain barriers to its widespread utilization. One such barrier when working with different healthcare **system**s is that they utilize different electronic medical rec**ord sy**stems (EMRs). This paper describes the experience of the North Carolina Statewide Telepsychiatry Program (NC-STeP) with this problem and how the program successfully resolved it by establishing a web portal that connects participating hospital emergency departments and **remot**e psychiatric providers to share secure electronic health information regarding patient encounters across different EMRs. The Portal also facilitates scheduling, status tracking, and reporting on each patient encounter, as well as delivers the necessary data for the billing to process charges for each consult and to administrators for the operation of the program. The portal effectively bridges the needs of the multiple actors in the telepsychiatry virtual encounter. It provides an efficient experience for the patient and the point-of-care provider, a reliable document exchange for the psychiatric provider, and effective record keeping for the billing and government entities.  2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature. eid: 2-s2.0-85037990118
3. **A Two-Tiered Strategy for Preventing Complications of Bereavement in the First Thirteen Months Post-Loss: A Pilot Study Using Peer Supports with Professional Therapist Back-up**
This feasibility and acceptance pilot study for preventing complications of bereavement within the first year post loss recruited 20 adult grievers within 9 months of becoming bereft and assigned consenting subjects to peer supporters trained by a non-profit bereavement support organization for weekly or bi-weekly telephone-based peer support until month 13 post-loss. Subjects who met DSM-5 criteria for major **depress**ive disorder or showed an Inventory of Complicated Grief (ICG) score exceeding 19, 6 months or more post loss, were assigned to 12 to 16 weeks of interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) with an experienced therapist. Eight and six subjects completed the protocol assigned to peer support and IPT, respectively, with pre/post Patient Health Questionnaire-9 scores of 5.38 (2.45) versus 3.25 (4.13) (p = 0.266) and 16.67 (7.17) versus 8.40 (5.73) (p =0.063); and pre/post ICG scores of 12.50 (4.72) versus 5.00 (2.51) (p = 0.016) and 35.17 (5.12) versus 8.4 (5.73) (p = 0.063). Implications of this two-tiered model of early intervention for preventing complications of grief are discussed.  2017 **American** Association for Geriatric Psychiatry eid: 2-s2.0-85030571254

5. **Telepsychiatry clinical decision support system used by non-psychiatrists in remote areas: Validity & reliability of diagnostic module**
Background & objectives: A knowledge-based, logically-linked online telepsychiatric decision support **system** for diagnosis and treatment of mental disorders was developed and validated. We evaluated diagnostic accuracy and reliability of the application at **remot**e sites when used by non-psychiatrists who underwent a brief training in its use through video-conferencing. Methods: The study was conducted at a nodal telepsychiatry centre, and three geographica**lly r**emote peripheral centres. The diagnostic tool of application had a screening followed by detailed criteria-wise diagnostic modules for 18 psychiatric disorders. A total of 100 consecutive consenting adult outpatients at**tendi**ng remote telepsychiatry centres were included. To assess inter-rater reliability, patients were interviewed face to face by non-spe**ciali**sts at remote sites using the application (active interviewer) and simultaneously on online application via video-conferencing by a passive assessor at nodal centre. Another interviewer at the nodal centre rated the patient using Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) for diagnostic validation. Results: Screening sub-module had **high** sensitivity (80-100%), low positive predictive values (PPV) (0.10-0.71) **but **high negative predictive value (NPV) (0.97-1) for most disorders. For the diagnostic sub-modules, Cohens kappa was >0.4 for all disorders, with kappa of 0.7-1.0 for most disorders. PPV and N**PV w**ere high for most disorders. Inter-rater agreement analysis revealed kappa >0.6 for all disorders. Interpretation & conclusions: Diagnostic tool showed acceptable to good validity and reliability when used by non**-spec**ialists at remote sites. Our findings show that diagnostic tool of the telepsychiatry application has potential to empower non-psychiatrist doctors and paramedics to diagnose psychiatric disorders accurat**ely a**nd reliably in remote sites.  2017, Indian Council of Medical Research.

6. **Decision support in addiction: The development of an e-health tool to assess and prevent risk of fatal overdose. The ORION Project**
Background and objective: The application of e-health technology to the field of substance use disorders is at a relatively early stage, and methodological quality is still variable. Few have explored the extent of utilization of communication technology in exploring risk perception by patients enrolled in substance abuse services.The Overdose RIsk InfOrmatioN (ORION) project is a European Commission funded programme, aimed to develop and pilot an e-health psycho-educational tool to provide information to drug using individuals about the risks of suffering a drug overdose. Methods: In this article, we report on phase 1 (risk estimation), phase 2 (**design**), and phase 3 (feasibility) of the ORION project. Results: The development of ORION e-health tool underlined the importance of an evidence-based intervention aimed in obtaining reliable evaluation of risk. The ORION tool supported a decision making process aimed at influencing the substance users' self-efficacy and the degree to which the substance users' understand risk factors. Therefore, its innovative power consisted in translating risks combination into a clear estimation for the user who will then appear more likely to be interested in his/her risk perception. Conclusion: Exploratory field testing and validation confirmed the next stage of evaluation, namely, collection of routine patient samples in study clinics. The associations between risk perception of overdose, engagement with the ORION tool and willingness to alter overdose risk factors, in a clinical setting across various EU member states will further confirm the ORION tool's generalisability and effectiveness.  2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. eid: 2-s2.0-84985037115
7. **Use of Telepsychiatry in Pediatric Emergency Room to Decrease Length of Stay for Psychiatric Patients, Improve Resident On-Call Burden, and Reduce Factors Related to Physician Burnout**
Background: Our study aims to demonstrate through implementation of telepsychiatry for child psychiatry patients evaluated in the pediatric emergency room (PedsER); we can reduce length of stay (LOS) and reduce factors contributing to physician burnout through reduction of on-call travel burden. Introduction: Telepsychiatry has increased access to health care using real-time interactive videoconferencing, allowing clinicians and patients in separate locations to have a meaningful clinical encounter. Use has increased over the past several years given cost reduction and need for psychiatric specialty services in under-resourced **system**s. Materials and Methods: We evaluated data regarding child psychiatry fellow use of telepsychiatry through a prospective real-time questionnaire filled out by the on-call clinician from July 1, 2017 to December 23, 2017 (study period). LOS was measured from the patient's registration time through time of discharge. Results: Telepsychiatry significantly reduced the total monthly LOS for nonhospitalized patients in the PedsER during the study period compared to all prior months (285-193 h; p = 0.032) and compared to a similar prior seasonal time frame (329-193 h; p = 0.017). Telepsychiatry use reduced travel for face-to-face evaluations by 75% and saved 2.22 h per call day. Discussion: Unique in this study is enhancing on-site psychiatric consultation in the emergency room, rather than solvin**g a sy**stems issue of referring out for psychiatric consultation. Moreover, this study uniquely demonstrated a noted improvement in on-call physician travel burden by reducing travel time with telepsychiatry. Physician burnout is notably **high** during residency training. Factors such as telepsychiatry can improve work efficiency and lend time to activities outside of work, mitigating the onset of this challenging issue. Conclusions: Telepsychiatry was shown to be effective in reducing dwell time and improving on-call burden. This study also showed promise** in ou**r system for improving access to other forms of specialized care consultation in PedsER settings.

8. **Telemental Health: Digital Disruption and the Opportunity to Expand Care**
Telemental health, which involves clinicians connecting **remot**ely to patients via teleconferencing, has seen growing interest. In addition to providing in-home treatment, this technology allows specialists to provide care** in r**emote and underserved areas. Current research suggests that both patients and clinicians are satisfied with telemental health services and that it is comparable in terms of quality to in-person care. Nonetheless, concerns still exist regarding its effects on the role of clinicians and the care they provide.  2016,  The Author(s) 2016. eid: 2-s2.0-84959422131
9. **An economic cost analysis of an expanding, multi-state behavioural telehealth intervention**
Introduction: In this paper the economic costs associated with a growing, multi-state telepsychiatry intervention serving **rural** **American** Indian/Alaska Native populations were compared to costs of travelling to provide/receive in-person treatment. Methods: Telepsychiatry costs were calculated using administrative, information-technology, equipment and technology components, and were compared to travel cost models. Both a patient travel and a psychiatrist travel model were estimated utilising ArcGIS software and unit costs gathered from literature and government sources. Cost structure and sensitivity analysis was also calculated by varying modeling parameters and assumptions. Results and Discussion: It is estimated that per-session costs were $93.90, $183.34, and $268.23 for telemedicine, provider-travel, and patient-travel, respectively. Restricting the analysis to satellite locations with a larger number of visits reduced telemedicine per-patient encounter costs (50 or more visits: $83.52; 100 or more visits: $80.41; and 150 or more visits: $76.25). The estimated cost efficiencies of telemedicine were more evident for hig**hly r**ural communities. Finally, we found that a multi-state centre was cheaper than each state operating independently. Conclusions: Consistent with previous research, this study provides additional evidence of the economic efficiency associated with telemedicine interventi**ons f**or ru**ral Amer**ican Indian/Alaska Native populations. Our results suggest that there are economies of scale in providing behavioural telemedicine and that bigger, multi-state telemedicine centres have lower overall costs compared to smaller, state-level centres. Additionally, results suggest that telemedicine structures with a **high**er number of per-satellite patient encounters have lower costs, and telemedicine centres delivering car**e t**o ****highly rural populations produce greater economic benefits.

10. **A study on collaborative telepsychiatric consultations to outpatients of district hospitals of Karnataka, India**
Introduction: The Indian National Mental Health Survey (NMHS) of 20152016 has estimated 13.7% lifetime and 10.6% point prevalence for mental illnesses. It has identified that the treatment gap for mental illnesses ranges between 70% and 92%. Tele-Psychiatric consultations could be an alternative and innovative approach to bridge this gap in low resource settings. Aims: To study the sociodemographic and clinical profiles of patients who have received collaborative Tele-Psychiatric consultations across district hospitals in Karnataka, India. Methodology: We performed a retrospective review of case files of patients who have received collaborative Tele-Psychiatric consultations from January 2013 to June 2017 through video-conferencing. A total of 139 consultations were provided to patients in the state of Karnataka. Results: The mean age of the sample is 31 (15.5) years. 61.8% were male and 79.8% were aged more than 18 years. In total, 25.9% of them had schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, 14.4% had mental retardation, 13.7% had a mood disorder and 14.4% had a substance use disorder. 67.6% of patients had been advised pharmacotherapy, 7.9% had been advised rehabilitation along with pharmacotherapy and 24.4% were advised further evaluation of illness and inpatient care at a **high**er centre. Conclusion: Collaborative tele-psychiatric consultations to district hospitals from an academic tertiary care hospital can be feasible and are likely to benefit patients from **rural** areas. There is a need for more studies to elucidate their acceptability by patients, caregivers and professionals.  2018 Elsevier B.V. eid: 2-s2.0-85054061928
11. **The case of telepsychiatry adoption and diffusion in a healthcare organization in New Zealand**
This research investigated telemedicine adoption and usage in psychiatry in one hospital in New Zealand (NZ). This research utilized the technological innovations theories as a guiding theoretical framework to develop a set of determinants of telemedicine adoption in healthcare organizations. The research looked at two stages in the case study concerning the adoption process of telemedicine, utilizing the video conferencing technology (TMVC). Prior to TMVC adoption, the findings suggested that TMVC was adopted according to its relative advantage and cost effectiveness, along with other facilitating factors such as image enhancement. None of the deterringfactors seemed to impede the adoption decision of TMVC. Results from the post-adoption stage suggested that TMVC was used minimally in the case study. The superficial assessment of important factors such as complexity and compatibility, prior to TMVC adoption, further suggested this weakness. In comparison with the literature, the incompatibility of TMVC in psychiatry stood as a unique cultural identifier pertaining to TMVC adoption in the NZ case study.

12. **Innovative new technologies to identify and treat traumatic brain injuries: Crossover technologies and approaches between military and civilian applications**
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has become the signature injury of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom. The use of improvised explosive devices has seen an exponential increase in both Iraq and Afghanistan. In previous conflicts prior to Iraq, survivability of such an injury was far less. Today, technological improvements in trauma care have increased an injured warfighter's chance of survival. A reduction in severe TBI has been achieved but an increase in mild or moderate TBI has been observed. The consequences of this kind of injury can be both physical and mental and can often be hidden or even misdiagnosed. The U.S. Army is interested in pursuing technological solutions for early detection and treatment of TBI to reduce its lasting impact on the warfighter. Such technological breakthroughs have benefit beyond the military, as TBI is a **high** probable event in nonmilitary settings as well. To gauge what technologies or methods are currently available, the U.S. Army's Telemedicine and Advanced Technology Research Center partnered with the **American** Telemedicine Association to organize and conduct a discipline-specific symposium entitled "Innovative New Technologies to Identify and Treat Traumatic Brain Injuries: Crossover Technologies and Approaches Between Military and Civilian Applications." This symposium was held in Palm Springs, CA, in September 2009. The purpose of the meeting was to provide a unique opportunity for leaders from disparate organizations involved in telemedicine and related other activities to meet and explore opportunities to collaborate in new partnership models. The meeting was **design**ed to help Telemedicine and Advanced Technology Research Center identify opportunities to expand strategic operations and form new alliances. This report summarizes this symposium while raising awareness for collaboration into better ways of adapting and adopting technologies to address this growing health issue.  2010, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-77952351531
13. **Cross-cultural aspects of depression management in primary care**
Major **depress**ive disorder (MDD) is a prevalent illness in minority populations. Minority patients with MDD are often unrecognized and untreated. This review examines promising interventions to address MDD in primary care settings, where minority groups are more likely to seek care. Since 2010, eleven interventions have been developed to address patient-specific and provider-specific barriers, many of which are adaptations of the collaborative care model. Other promising interventions include cultural tailoring of the collaborative care model, as well as the addition of telepsychiatry, motivational interviewing, cultural consultation, and innovations in interpreting. Overall, collaborative care was found feasible and improved satisfaction and treatment engagement** of dep**ressed minority patients in primary care. It remains inconclusive whether these newer intervention models improve MDD treatment outcomes. Future research will be needed to establish the effectiveness of these intervention models in improving the treatment outcomes of minority populations with MDD.

14. **Tailored online cognitive behavioural therapy with or without therapist support calls to target psychological distress in adults receiving haemodialysis: A feasibility randomised controlled trial**
Background Psychological distress is prevalent in haemodialysis (HD) patients yet access to psychotherapy remains limited. This study assessed the feasibility and acceptability of online cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) tailored for HD patients, with or without therapist support, for managing psychological distress. Methods This feasibility randomised controlled trial recruited patients from a UK HD centre. Following psychological distress screens, patients with mild-moderate psychological distress (Patient Health Questionnaire PHQ-9; score: 519 and/or Generalised Anxiety Disorder; GAD-7 score: 514) who met remaining inclusion criteria were approached for consent. Consenters were individually randomised (1:1) to online-CBT or online-CBT plus three therapist support calls. Outcomes included recruitment, retention, and adherence rates. Exploratory change analyses were performed for: psychological distress, quality of life (QoL), illness perceptions, and costs. The statistician was blinded to allocation. Results 182 (44%) out of 410 patients approached completed psychological distress screens. 26% found screening unacceptable; a further 30% found it unfeasible. Psychological distress was detected in 101 (55%) patients, 60 of these met remaining inclusion criteria. The primary reason for ineligibility was poor computer literacy (N = 17, 53%). Twenty-five patients were randomised to the supported (N = 18) or unsupported arm (N = 7); 92% were retained at follow-up. No differences in psychological distress or cost-effectiveness were observed. No trial adverse events occurred. Conclusion Online CBT appears feasible but only for computer literate patients who identify with the label psychological distress. A definitive trial using the current methods for psychological distress screening and online care delivery is unfeasible.

15. **Mental health services for Nunavut children and youth: Evaluating a telepsychiatry pilot project**
Introduction: This study examines the delivery of psychiatric consultation services using videoconferencing technology to health and mental health workers in the Nunavut territory of Canada. The research provides insights into the TeleLink Mental Health Program and the delivery of professional-to-professional program consultations and continuing education seminars. Methods: Participant observation of 12 program consultations and four continuing education sessions was conducted. Individual interviews were conducted with the consulting psychiatrist and the lead program coordinator in Nunavut. As well, a focus group was held with Nunavut workers who participated in the televideo sessions. Results: The study found a number of factors that facilitated or hindered the process and content of a consultation-based telepsychiatry program and its effect on building capacity among frontline staff. Four main themes emerged related to the delivery of psychiatric services via televideo: gaining access, ensuring culturally appropriate services, providing relevant continuing education, and offering stable and confidential technology. Conclusions: Live interactive videoconferencing technology is an innovative and effective way of delivering specialized mental health services to professionals working in **remot**e areas of Nunavut. Study results provide important strategies for expanding this approach to other jurisdictions in Nunavut and other Inuit regions.  T Volpe, KM Boydell, A Pignatiello, 2014. eid: 2-s2.0-84904618501
16. **A meta-analysis of the effectiveness of individually oriented Cognitive Behavioral Treatment (CBT) for severe aggressive behavior in adolescents**
This meta-analysis, including six studies (13 effect sizes) and 164 **adolesc**ents, examined the effectiveness of individually oriented treatment (which means that the intervention contained at least an individual component, possibly in combination with group and/or family therapy) with CBT-elements **for ado**lescents with severe aggression problems. A large and homogeneous overall effect size was found (d=1.139) indicating consistency across studies. The included studies examined the effect of three interventions, namely, mode deactivation therapy (MDT; four studies), stress-inoculation therapy (1), and the cell-phone program (1). This multilevel analysis demonstrated that only few individually oriented interventions have been developed and evaluated, while four of the included studies used a weak research **design**. Effective individually tailored interventions for youths with severe aggression problems (who are unsuitable for group treatment) are scant. There may be added value if group interventions are supplemented with more individually tailored evidence-based interventions.  2014,  2014 Taylor & Francis. eid: 2-s2.0-84914147813
17. **Implementation and Utilisation of Telepsychiatry in Ontario: A Population-Based Study**
Objective: **Rural** areas in Ontario have fewer psychiatrists, making access to specialist mental health care challenging. Our objective was to characterise psychiatrists delivering and patients receiving telepsychiatry in Ontario and to determine the number of patients who accessed a psychiatrist via telepsychiatry following discharge from psychiatric hospitalisation. Method: We conducted a serial panel study to evaluate the characteristics of psychiatrists providing telepsychiatry from April 2007 to March 2013. In addition, we conducted a cross-sectional study for fiscal year 2012-2013 to examine telepsychiatry patient characteristics and create an in-need patient cohort of individuals with a recent psychiatric hospitalisation that assessed if they had follow-up with a psychiatrist in person or through telepsychiatry within 1 year of discharge. Results: In fiscal year 2012-2013, a total of 3801 people had 5635 telepsychiatry visits, and 7% (n = 138) of Ontario psychiatrists provided telepsychiatry. Of the 48,381 people identified as in need of psychiatric care, 60% saw a local psychiatrist, 39% saw no psychiatrist, and less than 1% saw a psychiatrist through telepsychiatry only or telepsychiatry in addition to local psychiatry within a year. Three northern regions had more than 50% of in-need patients fail to access psychiatry within 1 year. Conclusions: Currently, relatively few patients and psychiatrists use telepsychiatry. In addition, patients scarcely access telepsychiatry for posthospitalisation follow-up. This study, which serves as a preliminary baseline for telepsychiatry in Ontario, demonstrates that telepsychiatry has not evolved **system**atically to address need and **high**lights the importance** of sy**stem-level planning when implementing telepsychiatry to optimise access to care.

18. **Satisfaction with long-distance motivational interviewing for problem drinking**
OBJECTIVES: To examine the relationship between participant preference and satisfaction with live interactive video, telephone, or face-to-face motivational interviewing sessions with problem drinkers. METHODS: Participants completed a satisfaction questionnaire after each motivational interviewing counseling session utilizing an abbreviated Likert scale. The participants were asked what mode they would have preferred, their satisfaction with their counselor, and their satisfaction with overall counseling. RESULTS: When asked to choose a long-distance mode of communication, televideo was preferred more than 2:1 over telephone. Also those with televideo experience were significantly more likely to choose televideo as a preferred long-distance mode of choice. CONCLUSIONS: Findings support the acceptability of 2 forms of long-distance communication, telephone and televideo, which might reasonably be studied in the future in **rural** areas (with some preference for televideo) to reduce heavy drinking and alcohol-related problems.  2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-33947185640
19. **Usability of online psychoeducation for siblings of people with psychosis**
Objectives: The E Sibling Project aims to address the needs of siblings of individuals affected by psychosis through provision of a comprehensive online intervention. The online intervention comprises four core elements, including: information on psychosis; various coping and promoting well-being strategies; siblings' blogs and discussion forum with peers; and an Ask the Experts function. After the intervention-prototype was developed, we tested its feasibility, usability and acceptability by siblings. Methods: We evaluated the usability of the intervention-prototype using a non-randomised usability study with siblings of individuals diagnosed with psychosis. The usability study adapted Poulson et al's framework to collect subjective feedback from participants on ease of use, perceived usefulness and acceptability, together with objective usage data on the intervention. Results: Twenty siblings were recruited to the usability test; 19 tried out the resource-prototype over a 4-week period and 17 completed the online evaluation after using the intervention. In total, 906 page-views were made by the participants and each spent about two hours using the resource. Participants evaluated the intervention as helpful, relevant and useful in terms of content, **design** and usability. Developments are needed to improve the navigation and intuitiveness of the resource. Conclusions: Using an internet-based information-giving and peer support intervention to promote wellbeing and coping is feasible and acceptable to siblings of people with psychosis.

20. **Counseling center-based tele-mental health for students at a rural university**
Students attending **rural** academic institutions often have no immediate access to psychiatrists to supplement on-site Counseling Center (CC) services. Because the Medical College of Georgia (MCG) could not cost-effectively provide on-site psychiatry services to Georgia Southern University (GSU) students, the two institutions explored telehealth services delivered by supervised Psychiatry residents using Web-based videoconferencing on MCG's virtual private network. GSU counselors completed client severity rating forms. CC clients in ongoing therapy who were judged to be in need of psychiatric services were referred to the Tele-clinic (TC). CC counselors referred the most challenged students to TC according to total distress score on intake, clinician intake assessment of client difficulty, and client need for medications. After seeing the clients in TC, MCG residents also completed GSU CC client severity rating forms. Post-intake and satisfaction surveys already in use at the GSU CC were completed both by CC clients not in TC and by CC clients jointly enrolled in TC. TC and CC populations were compared by gender, race, past mental health treatment, past psychiatric hospitalization, and past and current use of psychotropic drugs. Telepsychiatry conducted using low bandwidth videoconferencing successfully supplemented GSU CC mental healthcare, especially for clients with the most serious problems, and did so without travel from campus and within the milieu of daily student life. Cost-effective telepsychiatry services can successfully supplement management of students with mental health issues who att**end r**ural, smaller, and/or resource-challenged academic institutions.

21. **Reaching rural communities with culturally appropriate care: A model for adapting remote monitoring to American Indian veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder**
Objective: Providing specialized healthcare to **rural** communities can be extremely difficult, and consequently many health organizations are turning to the use of telehealth technologies for care delivery. One such technology, **remot**e monitoring, has been successfully implemented with patients suffering from chronic and other medical conditions. A drawback, however, is t**hat r**emote monitoring devices are programmed to reach a broad audience, and consequently the content may not be suitable for all patients - especially those who are not a part of the dominant culture. Subjects and Methods: This report provides a model for a**dapti**ng remote monitoring to specific populations who are undergoing care for posttraumatic stress disorder. Adaptation changes focus on (1) information gathering, (2) process and dialogue changes, (3) testing, and (4) patient and administrative feedback. Data for such modifications were gathered through a series of community meetings, patient interviews, and provider feedback. A case example **high**lights the successful implementation of the adaptation model fo**r a r**ural **American** Indian Veteran population. Results: Patients sho**wed **high acceptability of both the programmatic and cultural adaptations. Feasibility of the program also appeared positive, with most patients reporting that the readability of the program was appropriate, the dialogue duration was not burdensome, and technical problems were rare. C**onclu**sions: Remote monitoring provides the ability to be modified for use with certain subpopulations. Procedural recommendations in this** rep**ort highlight special considerations for working w**ith Amer**ican Indians living on or near reservation areas, although the model can be broadly adapted to several groups.

22. **Testing effectiveness of a community-based aggression management program for children 7 to 11 years old and their families**
OBJECTIVE: There are few well-evaluated uncomplicated community-based interventions for childhood aggression. The authors assess the impact of a community-based anger management group on child aggressive behaviors, using a randomized, controlled trial (RCT). METHOD: Families with children 7 to 11 years old were recruited through advertisements and randomized (N = 123). Inclusion required parent concern about anger/aggressive behavior, RCT agreement, and a telephone behavior screen. Intervention participants were offered three parent education/skill-building group sessions, 10 weekly child group sessions, and three in-home family practice sessions. Nine groups ran from August 2002 to August 2004. Interviewers nave to randomization collected data on all participants pre- and postgroup. Outcomes included child-rated anger and parent-rated child aggressive behavior, externalizing behavior and hostility, parent-child relationship, and parenting stress. Intent-to-treat analyses were done. RESULTS: Pre/postoutcome comparisons indicated no significant differences between intervention versus control, with small effect sizes for most outcomes (0.27-0.29). Although not significant, the magnitude of improvement favored intervention families on all parent-rated measures. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, there was no differential impact of participating in a community-based anger management group versus control on child aggressive behaviors and other associated measures. The impact of regression to the mean, effect, and sample size estimates; child comorbidity; and programmatic and methodological issues are discussed. 2006 by the **American** Academy of Child and **Adolesc**ent Psychiatry. eid: 2-s2.0-33748434647
23. **A comparison of mental health diagnoses treated via interactive video and face to face in the veterans healthcare administration**
Objective: This study compares the mental health diagnoses of encounters delivered face to face and via interactive video in the Veterans Healthcare Administration (VHA). Materials and Methods: We compiled 1 year of national-level VHA administrative data for Fiscal Year 2012 (FY12). Mental health encounters were those with both a VHA Mental Health Stop Code and a Mental Health Diagnosis (n=11,906,114). Interactive video encounters were identified as those with a Mental Health Stop Code, paired with a VHA Telehealth Secondary Stop Code. Primary diagnoses were grouped into posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), **depress**ion, anxiety, bipolar disorder, psychosis, drug use, alcohol use, and other. Results: In FY12, 1.5% of all mental health encounters were delivered via interactive video. Compared with face-to-face encounters, a larger percentage of interactive video encounters was for PT**SD, dep**ression, and anxiety, whereas a smaller percentage was for alcohol use, drug use, or psychosis. Conclusions: Providers and patients may feel more comfortable t**reating** depression and anxiety disorders than substance use or psychosis via interactive video.  2015, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-84936952569
24. **Feasibility and promise of a remote-delivered preconception motivational interviewing intervention to reduce risk for alcohol-exposed pregnancy**
Background: Alcohol-exposed pregnancy (AEP) is a leading cause of birth defects. Effective face-to-face preconception interventions based on motivational interviewing (MI) exist and should be translated into **remot**e formats for maximum public health impact. This study investigated the feasibility and promise of a one-sessi**on, r**emote-delivered, preconception, MI-based AEP intervention** (EAR**LY Remote) for non-treatment-seeking community women. Subjects and Methods: This was a single-arm, prospective pilot intervention study. All participants received the intervention via telephone and mail. Fea**sibil**ity of remote-delivery methods, treatment engagement, treatment credibility, MI treatment integrity, and therapeutic alliance were examined. Outcomes were 3- and 6-month drinks per drinking day (DDD), rate of unreliable contraception, and proportion of women at risk for AEP due to continued risk drinking and no or unreliable contraception use. Results:** Feas**ibility of remote delivery was established; participants were engaged by the intervention and rated it as credible. Integrity to MI and therapeutic alliance were good. Both DDD and rate of unreliable contraception decreased significantly over time. Proportions of women who drank at risk levels, used unreliable or no contraception, and/or were at risk for AEP in the past 90 days decreased significantly from baseline to 6 m**onths**. Conclusions: Remote delivery was feasi**ble, **and the translated remote intervention may reduce AE**P ris**k. Refinement of EARLY Remote may facilitate its placement within a spectrum of effective MI-based preconception AEP interventions as part of** a st**epped-care approach. EARLY Remote may have an important role within a stepped-care model for dissemination to geographically disperse women at risk for AEP. This could result in substantial public health impact through reduction of AEP on a larger scale.  Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-84899780736
25. **Relative efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy administered by videoconference for posttraumatic stress disorder: A six-month follow-up**
Until recently, only one study was published on cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in individual therapy via videoconference (Germain, Marchand, Bouchard, Drouin, &amp; Guay, 2009); however, it only assessed the posttreatment effect. This study presents the follow-up of Germain et al.'s (2009) study. The main goal was to compare the effectiveness after six months of CBTfor PTSD either face-to-face (n = 24) or by videoconference (n = 12). Each participant received CBT for 16 to 25 weeks and completed various questionnaires before and after treatment and at a six-month follow-up. The two treatments had equivalent levels of symptom reduction (Modified PTSD Symptom Scale: 2 &lt; 0.01, p &gt;.05) and proportion of patients with a clinically significant change in symptoms (42% for face-to-face vs. 38% for videoconferencing, p &gt;.05). Thus, CBTfor PTSD via videoconference seems to be a viable alternative when adequate face-to-face treatments are less available. Copyright  Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC. eid: 2-s2.0-79956028546
26. **Assessment of SUNY Upstate medical university's child telepsychiatry consultation program**
Objectives: The project assesses the child telepsychiatry services provided by SUNY Upstate psychiatrists to several county mental health clinics in central New York State. Method: Data for 45 patients was extracted from pre-consultation forms completed by the referring clinic and postconsultation summaries completed by the Upstate psychiatrists that occurred between July 13, 2009 and May 12, 2010. The study identified characteristics of patients for whom telepsychiatry consultations were sought, why they were sought, and reviewed recommended changes in therapy and medication provided by the telepsychiatry consultant. Results: Analysis of the data showed that there was a large variation in patient characteristics such as age (from age 3 to 17), current living situation, and psychological symptoms. In addition to a family history of mental illness (80%), the most common symptoms were physical aggression (60.0%), defiant/oppositional behavior (57.8%), and attentional problems (55.6%). The most common reason for referral was diagnostic clarification (67%). The child telepsychiatrist recommended a change in medication for most (80.8%) of the patients who were on medications, and to begin medications for most (63.2%) who were not receiving medication at the time of consult. Further, the telepsychiatrist often recommended the addition of family therapy (71.1%) and counseling at school (17.8%). Conclusion: The child telepsychiatric program at Upstate seemed effective. It reached a large variety of children with significant mental disorders. The consultants provided diagnostic clarification and recommended modification of treatment for most. However, this assessment is limited as examined as it did not include follow-up information on whether consultant recommendations were followed and, if they were, whether they were effective.  2011, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-81755188307
27. **Psychosocial Outcomes of Telephone-Based Counseling for Adults With an Acquired Physical Disability: A Meta-Analysis**
Background: The delivery of mental health services by telephone, referred to as telecounseling, has the potential to improve the health outcomes of adults with an acquired physical disability in a cost-effective way. However, the efficacy of this form of treatment requires further evaluation before it is used on a larger scale. Aim: This meta-analysis provides a critical and quantitative evaluation of the impact of telephone-administered psychological interventions on the psychosocial functioning of adults with an acquired physical disability caused by spinal cord injury, limb amputation, severe burn injury, stroke, or multiple sclerosis. Method: A comprehensive search of eight electronic databases identified eight studies (N = 658 participants) that compared treatment efficacy to that of matched control groups. Differences in the psychosocial outcomes of treatment and control participants were examined using Cohen's d effect sizes. Fail-safe Ns and 95% confidence intervals were used to evaluate the significance of these results. Results: Significant improvements in coping skills and strategies (overall d = 0.57), community integration (overall d = 0.45), and **depress**ion (overall d = 0.44) were observed immediately after telecounseling, with modest improvements in quality of life maintained at 12 months post-intervention (overall d = 0.37). Conclusions: The results suggest that telecounseling is an effective treatment modality for adults adjusting to a physical disability; however, further trials are needed to establish the long term psychosocial benefits.  2011 **American** Psychological Association. eid: 2-s2.0-79953000887
28. **Telepsychiatry in the Heartland: If we build it, will they come**
The quality of care provided by telemedicine and its acceptability to persons who live in **rural** areas is largely undetermined. In this study, service satisfaction and functional status in persons using telemedicine was compared to those receiving face-to-face services at **two r**ural sites over a 2-year study period. Similar ratings of satisfaction and clinical status were observed in twelve patients who received services under both modalities. Although there are many obstacles to successful program implementation, telepsychiatry appears to offer an acceptable and adequate alternative mode of service delivery to persons who **live **in rural areas. eid: 2-s2.0-0035486683
29. **Process of design and usability evaluation of a telepsychology web and virtual reality system for the elderly: Butler**
Butler is a multi-application **system** based on Internet technology and virtual reality, **design**ed to meet the needs of elderly users. Its objectives are to assist elderly populations in accessing technology and new forms of communication, replicating, as far as possible the way of lineal interaction that this population group had traditionally to interact with information in order to facilitate the first contacts with technology. Butler is equipped with e-mail, videoconferencing, blogging, access to the Internet through a well-known web search engine, image and sound gallery, new contacts searcher, and two virtual reality environments. In this paper we describe Butler's most relevant features taking into account the usabil**ity de**sign process and the usability evaluation of **the sy**stem, which, after pilot testing, have proven to be **high**ly acceptable and satisfactory to users. We also present the results of evaluations pertaining to the iconography used in the program, the navigation and user**s' hel**p design process, and the first functional prototype, all of** which** were** desig**ned and redesigned with the aid of web heuristics and gui**deline**s for the web design for elderly users. Results suggest important features to be **taken **into account when designing and developing this sort of application for the elderly.  2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The Butler **system** is an e-health platform **design**ed to improve the elderly population's quality of life. The But**ler sy**stem has three applications diagnostic, therapeutic and playful. The objective of this work is to present the influence of the use of the platform on elderly users' mood states and the degree of acceptance. These measures were assessed through visual analogical scales before and after the platform use, with the outcome measures MANOVAS analyses were performed. Seventeen users (from 58 to 79 years old) completed four sessions w**ith th**e system; they could choose which technological resources they used in each session. The results showed that afte**r usin**g the system, the participants' insensitive emotions increased and their negative ones decreased. In addition, they obtained **high** levels of satisfaction, low levels of subjective difficulty and would recommend Butler to other users. Therefore, the results indicate that Butler might **be an **effective system for improving emotional states in elderly population.  2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. eid: 2-s2.0-77957994043

Objective: To test the effectiveness of brief behavioral intervention for insomnia in **rural** elderly. Methods: Twenty older insomniacs (65 years of age) were randomly assigned to sleep hygiene education (SHE; N=9) or multicomponent behavioral treatment (MBT; N= 1**1). R**ural care providers individually administered treatment (two in-person sessions/two telephone followups). Training involved a two-day workshop. Results: At posiireatment, 10 MBT participants no longer met criteria for insomnia compared to 3 SHE participants. Conclusion: Brief behavioral intervention for late-life insomnia can be quickly taught and effectively delivered by "real-world" care provi**ders **in rural primary care settings.  2007 **American** Association for Geriatric Psychiatry. eid: 2-s2.0-38449095040

33. **A videophone psychosocial intervention for dementia caregivers**
Background/Objectives: Available services and intervention programs for dementia caregivers are often underutilized because of issues such as cost, logistics, lack of knowledge about available services, or insufficient support from others. Information technologies offer the potential of removing these barriers and facilitating the ability of caregivers to access needed support. This project evaluated the feasibility and efficacy of technologybased psychosocial intervention among minority family caregivers of dementia patients. **Design**: A feasibility and efficacy trial. Setting: Participants' homes in the Greater Miami Community. Participants: One hundred ten (56 Hispanic **American** and 54 Afri**can Amer**ican) caregivers of patients with dementia. Intervention: A technologybased multi-component psychosocial intervention was delivered in-home and via videophone technology over 5 months. The intervention wasmodeled after the REACH II intervention and targeted known areas of caregiver risk. Measurement: Standardized measures of **depress**ion, caregiver burden, social support, and the caregivers' perception of the caregiver's experience were administered at baseline and 5 months postrandomization. Results: Overall, caregivers who received the intervention reported a decrease in burden, an increase in perceived social support and positive perceptions of the caregiving experience. No effect was observed **for dep**ression. Most participants indicated that the intervention improved their caregiving skills and found the technology to be easy to use. Conclusions: A technology-based format was feasible for delivering a multi-component intervention to minority family dementia caregivers. The intervention improved caregiver outcomes for both Hispanic and **African **American caregivers. The results suggest that technology may help eliminate disparities in access to caregiver intervention prog**rams.  2**013 American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry. eid: 2-s2.0-84888644123
34. **Telepsychiatry with incarcerated youth**
Purpose: Incarcerated **adolesc**ents have a **high** prevalence of psychiatric disorders but lack psychiatrists to provide ongoing care. Telepsychiatry may provide one solution to treating this underserved population. Methods: Interactive video conferencing was used to connect a minimum security correctional facility with a regional telemedicine program. Clinical records were reviewed to examine utilization, demographics, diagnoses, pharmacotherapy, and patient satisfaction. Results: During the 29-month study period, 115 youth were treated using 275 telepsychiatry visits. Substance-use, behavioral, and emotional disorders w**ere **highly prevalent. Eighty percent (80%) of the youth were successfully prescribed medications. Youth expressed confidence with the psychiatrist's recommendations but expressed concerns about privacy. Conclusions: Telepsychiatry can successfully deliver services to incarcera**ted ado**lescents with a wide range of psychiatric needs. A patient-centered approach that directly a**ssesses** adolescents' satisfaction is recommended to ensure youths' optimal involvement in needed services.  2006 **Society** for Adolescent Medicine. eid: 2-s2.0-33646766442
35. **Telemedicine and advances in urban and rural healthcare delivery in Africa**
Telecardiology holds great promise for Africa, from tele-echocardiography and tele-ECG s, to home monitoring and text messaging for medication adherence monitoring. The burden of disease is great and there is an extreme shortage of health professionals. Telemedicine can provide access to scarce specialist care, improve the quality of care in **rural** areas and reduce the need **for r**ural patients to travel to seek medical attention. International cross border service can alleviate the shortage of doctors. But telecardiology, and telemedicine uptake in general, has been poor in Africa. Legal and ethical issues around local and cross border telemedicine have not been resolved. The literature was reviewed and obstacles to telemedicine in Africa and current telemedicine activities in Africa, are described. There are few sustained telemedicine services in Africa with the exception of tele-education. There is an expectation that mobile phones will facilitate a range of telemedicine activities in Africa.

New telecommunications technologies promise to profoundly change the spatial and temporal relationship between health professional and patient. This paper reports results from an ethnographic study of the introduction of a videophone or telemedicine **system** intended to facilitate faster and more convenient referral of patients with anxiety and **depress**ion in primary care, to a community mental health team. We explore the reasons for contest over the telemedic**ine sy**stem in practice, contrasting professionals critique of the technology in play with a more fundamental problem: the extent to which the telecommuni**cation**s system threatened deeply embedded professional constructs about the nature and practice of therapeutic relationships.

37. **Usability analysis of a system for cognitive rehabilitation, "gradior", in a Spanish Region**
Objective: The main aim of our research is to assess the use, satisfaction, and pedagogy of software for neuropsychological rehabilitation by computer, called "Gradior," to obtain relevant information on the impact of information and communications technology on people with severe and prolonged mental illness. Methods: To evaluate the usability and satisfaction standards, the questionnaire "Usability survey on the use of the cognitive rehabilitation and assessment program by computer" was completed by 83 patients of the Rodrguez Chamorro Hospital. Results: The results of the study show that Gradior has 81.2% acceptance and 83.7% general assessment. This indicates that those who responded to the survey consider that the Gradior program improves cognitive functions and abilities in patients with severe and prolonged mental illness and therefore their quality of life. Conclusion: This research is oriented toward professionals of the Health Area and **System**s Engineers, who develop software for neuropsychological rehabilitation with neurocognitive deficit. The purpose is to make the learning process more effective among the people who use it and to improve usability for specific groups. We hope that the reading of the work contributes to the activities, techniques and materials planned are in accordance with the needs of the population affected with cognitive disorders.  2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-85084640524
38. **Evaluating Telehealth Websites for Information Consistent with APA Guidelines for Telepsychology**
The authors evaluated websites offering therapeutic telehealth services (N = 55) using a 38-item checklist based on the **American** Psychological Associations Guidelines for the Practice of Telepsychology (APA Guidelines) to determine the extent that online service providers included such information on their websites. On average, the websites reviewed addressed only 39% of the checklist criteria. These findings are disconcerting and suggest most providers websites do not include information that would help potential clients make informed decisions about online treatment. The authors urge more providers to consider offering telehealth services to increase the supply of qualified providers in response to growing consumer demand.  2019,  2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. eid: 2-s2.0-85076925577

Context: Telepsychiatry has become a common modality for the provision of psychiatric consultations to patients in **rural** regions. Aims: The aims of this study were to assess and compare patient and provider satisfaction and perceptions of access to care with telepsychiatry. Methods: Telepsychiatric consultations were given by providers based on an urban tertiary academic health centre to patients located** in r**ural primary care clinics. Results: Patients (n = 110) and providers (n = 10) were both **high**ly satisfied with telepsychiatry and both believed that telepsychiatry provided patients with better access to care. Paired patient and provider survey results demonstrate**d a **high level of concordance between patients and provider responses. Conclusions: Concordance between patient and provider satisfaction may contribute to adherence and positive treatment outcomes. These results provide support for the use of telepsychiatry consultations to improve patient access to psychiatric **care **in rural regions.Contexte: La tlpsychiatrie est maintenant une modalit courante de prestation de services psychiatriques aux patients vivan**t en **rgions rurales.

40. **Challenges and perspectives in the private practice of psychiatry: The development of tele-psychiatry [Enjeux et perspectives de la psychiatrie librale: le dveloppement de la tl-psychiatrie]**
Fall 2018 a comprehensive legislation has been launched in France on the practice of telemedicine, hence tele-psychiatry, historically one of its oldest application. This paper resulted from a presentation that has been made at the French Medico-Psychological Society President's Day, and aims at pointing out certain regulatory, ethical, and practical challenges in the development of tele-psychiatry, in a truly progressive manner, given its importance to the accelerating processes of digitalisation within our societies. French users of telemedicine services are 4 % only, which has to be compared to 31 % of Saudis: usage has evolved since 2010, year in which the first telemedicine legislation has been implemented in France. In just a few years, mobile health (m-health) has become increasingly important, while the legislation, and the funding models, were unchanged. Psychiatrists practicing telemedicine may simply use video consultation, but those who wish to, can also digitalise their practice from case history to analysis and prescription, with dedicated assistance software. In any case, practising telemedicine requires the use of approved software, prior training, and professionalism. Key features of Good Video Consultation Practices are described therein, along with broad recommendations on practicing trans-border video consultation sessions.  2018 Elsevier Masson SAS eid: 2-s2.0-85059465160

Background Internet technology offers psychiatrists new opportunities for **remot**e interaction with patients. It also raises issues regarding therapeutic effectiveness, safety, technical problems and possibilities for overcoming them, and matters related to specific mental health problems such as autism. The case presented concerns an **adolesc**ent male with severe social impairment and isolation as manifestations of Aspergers syndrome.Methods The patient was accepted contact with psychiatric services through telepsychiatry, which enabled initial assessment and the development of a therapeutic relationship.Results In due course the patient was able to attend the clinic in person. He became somewhat reconciled to his family. With appropriate adaptations he was able to resume his education and career.Conclusions Telepsychiatry shows promise in engaging with patients with autism spectrum disorders.

42. **The small-world of cybertherapy**
Is cybertherapy a scientific paradigm? Is it made up of heterogeneous individuals or an organized scientific community? How has it evolved since 2006? To answer these questions, we took an interest in the keywords used in the scientific literature dealing with cybertherapy. A network approach has been put forward in order to (1) **high**light the most central concepts, (2) to make some themes emerge, (3) to determine whether this structure could testify to a small-world organization, revealing paradigmatic aspects of a scientific discipline. 1510 articles have been extracted from the Pubmed and Elsevier databases from the query:  cybertherapy  OR "computer based therapy" OR "online therapy" OR "tele-psychology" OR "telepsychotherapy" OR  tele-mental health ". Over the period considered, (i) the conceptual network appears coherent and organized (S = 3.28), (ii) 18 themes emerge, (iii) the anxious disorders seem particularly central. The analysis of the temporal evolution shows an increase in the number of keywords which, combined with a reduction in the number of themes, makes possible to circumscribe the cybertherapy more than to promote its scattering. Although still above 3, the S-smallworld index decreases from year to year. All the results support an exemplary cybertherapeutic paradigm. However, the decline in the small world index over time invites us to ensure that this scientific coherence remains at the risk of a scattering of cybertherapy that could lead to an impoverishment of its identity. Ethical, methodological and educational implications are considered.  2017, Interactive Media Institute. All rights reserved. eid: 2-s2.0-85043790267
43. **Cybertherapy: A scientific model? A text mining analysis of published abstracts**
In the field of cybertherapies, meta-analysis reveal the scientific advancement in different fields, such as virtual reality exposure therapy for anxiety disorders [1] or the effect of immersive technology on user presence [2]. Certainly, knowledge about a phenomenon depends on results. But, following a socioconstructivist approach [3], it seems obvious that these results also depend on the researchers intentionality, which fluctuates with social, cultural, economic, political or theoretical circumstances. Researchers implicit models [4] also impact the **design** of the studies, the results and consequently, the scientific representation of the investigated phenomenon. One way to assess scientific models is to study publications abstracts. In order to observe the scientific models in cybertherapies and their evolution, we analyzed 857 abstracts from indexed Pubmed publications, obtained in January 2016 with the following requests: cybertherapy OR computer based therapy OR online therapy OR web based therapy OR telepsychology OR telepsychotherapy OR tele-mental health ". Following data-mining methods [5], we combined (a) classical approaches in lexicometry [6], [5], (b) the  Meaning Extraction Method  [7] and (c) network analyses [8]. We also crossed data with publications dates to observe the evolution of the concepts. Results will help us to observe the evolution of scientific models in cybertherapies as well as the evolution of concepts such as emotions or intersubjectivity.  2016 by Interactive Media Institute. eid: 2-s2.0-85019576426
