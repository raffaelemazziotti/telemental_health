0. **Impact of integrating psychiatric assessment officers via telepsychiatry on rural hospitals' emergency revisit rates**
Objective: To assess the impact of integrating Psychiatric Assessment Officers (PAO) and telepsychiatry in rural hospitals on their all-cause **emerg**ency **depart**ment (ED) revisit rates. As a pilot project, a full-time PAO was embedded in each of three rural hospitals in New York State and was augmented by telepsychiatry. Method: A retrospective data analysis using ED census data obtained from the hospitals. The intervention group, defined as those patients treated by PAOs, was compared via a difference-in-difference method against a contemporaneous comparison group defined as those who visited the same EDs and had PAO-qualifying behavioral health diagnoses but were not seen by PAOs. Results: The intervention group was associated with an approximately 36% lower all-cause ED revisit rate during the **first** 90-day period (i.e. 190 days) following the initial PAO treatment (p = .003). A reduction of the similar magnitude (44%) persisted into the subsequent 90-day period (i.e., 91180 days since the initial PAO treatment; p < .001). Conclusion: The PAO telepsychiatry pilot program suggests a potential way to provide relief for overburdened EDs in rural communities that lack resources to treat patients with severe behavioral health symptoms.  2020 Elsevier Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-85082170593
1. **Emergency Department Telepsychiatry Service Model for a Rural Regional Health System: The First Steps**
Background: **Emerg**ency **depart**ments (EDs) have recognized an increasing number of patients presenting with mental health (MH) concerns. This trend imposes greater demands upon EDs already operating at capacity. Many ED providers do not feel they are optimally prepared to provide the necessary MH care. One consideration in response to this dilemma is to use advanced telemedicine technology for psychiatric consultation. Introduction: We examined a rural-and community-based health system operating 21 EDs, none of which has direct access to psychiatric consultation. Dedicated beds to MH range from zero (in EDs with only 3 beds) to 6 (in an ED with 38 beds). Materials and Methods: We conducted a needs assessment of this health system. This included a survey** of e**mergency room providers with a 67% response rate and site visits to directly observe patient flow and communication with ED staff. A visioning workshop provided input from ED staff. Data were also obtained, which reflected ED admissions for the year 2015. Results: The data provide a summary of provider concerns, a summary of MH presentations and diagnosis, and age groupings. The data also provide a time when most MH concerns present to the ED. Discussion: Based upon these results, a proposed model for delivering comprehensive r**egion**al emergency telepsychiatry and behavioral health services is proposed. C**onclu**sions: Emergency telepsychiatry services may be a tenable solution for addressing the shortage of psychiatric consultation to EDs in light of increasing demand for MH treatment in the ED.  2019, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-85059896853
2. **Evaluation and Implementation of a Telepsychiatry Trial in the Emergency Department of a Metropolitan Public Hospital**
Telepsychiatry via video conferencing is not new to mental health but has been expanding at a rapid rate over recent years. Initially it was introduced for treatment in **remot**e and rural communities, but it is now being utilized in larger health settings due to increasing patient demand and cost-effectiveness. **Emerg**ency **depart**ments are becoming increasingly burdened, as the workforce cannot keep pace with the rising demand of patient mental health needs. While telepsychiatry has been shown to have treatment efficacy, research is still relatively new, especially within **the e**merge**ncy de**partment context.  2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. eid: 2-s2.0-85029905979
3. **The symbolic affordances of a video-mediated gaze in emergency psychiatry**
While mental illness is a significant health challenge worldwide, the availability of specialists is limited, especially in rural areas and for psychiatric **emerg**encies. Although tele-psychiatry, via real-time videoconferencing (VC), is used to provide consultative services in areas that lack psychiatrists, there are a paucity of studies on the use of VC for psychiat**ric e**mergencies. We examine how VC matters for patient involvement and professional practice in the **first** No**rwegi**an emergency tele-psychiatric service. Through a decentralised on-call system, psychiatrists are accessible 24/7 by telephone and VC for patients and nurses in regional psychiatry centres. Based on 29 interviews with patients, psychiatrists and nurses, this article addresses how participation is fostered by VC, and how it may change the social dynamics of **thera**peutic emergency encounters. We identified four contributions of the video-mediated gaze in the therapeutic encounter including those of the: (1) immediacy of assessment, (2) increased transparency, (3) sense of access to the real expert, and (4) fostering of the patient's voice in therapeutic decisions. These VC inflections of the therapeutic encounter are a mix of the pragmatic (1 and 2) and the symbolic (3 and 4), assembling in these contexts to foster patient-centeredness. With a sociological approach to vi**deo-c**onferenced emergency psychiatry, the identification of symbolic affordances adds necessary nuances to the application of new technologies into fragile therapeutic communication.  2017 Elsevier Ltd eid: 2-s2.0-85037345227
4. **Telephone-based low intensity therapy after crisis presentations to the emergency department is associated with improved outcomes**
Introduction In **Australia** there is an overwhelming need to provide effective treatment to patients presenting to the **Emerg**ency **Depart**ment (ED) in mental health crisis. We adapted Improving Access to Psychological Therapies service model (IAPT) from the National Health Service (NHS) method for the large scale delivery of psychological therapies throughout the United Kingdom to** an Austr**alian ED setting. This telephone-based low intensity therapy was provided to people presenting in crisis to the EDs with combinations of anxiety, depression, substance use, and suicidal thinking. Methods This uncontrolled study utilised session-by-session, before-and-after measures of anxiety and depression via Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7). Results Of 347 eligible post-crisis ED referred patients, 291 (83.9%) engaged with the IAPT team. Most patients (65%) had attended the ED previously on an average of 3.9 (SD = 6.0) occasions. Two hundred and forty one patients received an average of 4.1 (SD = 2.3) contacts of low-intensity psychological therapies including 1.2 (SD = 1.7) community outreach visits between 20th Oct 2011 and 31st Dec 2012. Treated patients reported clinically significant improvements in anxiety, depression and suicidal ideation. Uncontrolled effect sizes were moderate for anxiety (0.6) and depression (0.6). Discuss**ion The A**ustralian ED IAPT program demonstrated that the UK IAPT program could be adapted **for e**mergency mental health patients and be associated with similar clinical benefits as the original program.

5. **Child and Adolescent Emergency and Urgent Mental Health Delivery Through Telepsychiatry: 12-Month Prospective Study**
Background: The significant gap between children and **adolesc**ents presenting for **emerg**ency mental healthcare and the shortage of child **and ado**lescent psychiatrists constitutes a major barrier to timely access for psychiatric assessment for rural and **remot**e areas. Unl**ike r**emote areas, ur**ban e**mergency **depart**ments have in-house psychiatric consultation. Telepsychiatry may be a solution to ensure the same serv**ice f**or remote areas. However, there is a paucity of studies on the use of telepsychiatry for child and ado**lesce**nt emergency consults. Thus, the aim of our study was to (1) assess patient satisfaction with telepsychiatry and (2) compare clinical characteristics and outcome of telepsychiatry with f**ace-t**o-face emergency ch**ild and** adolescent assessments. Methods: This is a prospective study of** tele**psychiatry emergency assessments of children and adol**escen**ts referred by emergency physicians. The comparison group was age- and gender-matched patients seen for face-to-face urgent assessments. Data were gathered on demographic and clinical variables. Telepsychiatry satisfaction was assessed using a questionnaire. Descriptive statistics and chi-square tests were used to assess group differences for each variable. Logistic regression was used to assess impact of the variables on outcome after the consult. A p value <0.05 was used to determine statistical significance. Results: Sixty (n = 60) assessments were conducted through telepsychiatry in 12 months. Among the telepsychiatry group, Aboriginal patients were over-represented (50% vs. 6.7%, p < 0.001), a higher proportion received a diagnosis of adjustment disorder (22% vs. 8.3%, p = 0.004) or no diagnosis (27% vs. 6.7%, p = 0.004) compared with controls. There was no statistically significant difference between groups on other clinical variables. Patients reported a high degree of satisfaction with telepsychiatry. Conclusions: Telepsychiatry is acceptable to patient**s and** families for safe emergency assessment and follow-up, reducing unnecessary travel to urban centers. Longer time outcomes are needed to establish val**idity** of telepsychiatry for emergency assessments.  Copyright 2017, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2017. eid: 2-s2.0-85031290037
6. **A transferable telepsychiatry model for improving access to emergency mental health care**
The Mental Health **Emerg**ency Care-Rural Access Programme (MHEC) aims to improve access to special**ist e**mergency mental health care in rural and **remot**e communities in New South Wales. It provides a range of services in**cludi**ng emergency telephone triage and video assessment. The present report provides a detailed description of the structure and function of the MHEC model, and identifies matters concerning adaptation and transferability. Structure: the MHEC can be contacted 24 hours/day, every day of the year; no caller is refused assistance. Function: the MHEC provides information services, clinical services and other programme activities. Adaptation of the model and implementation elsewhere (transferability) should be informed by local needs, existing practices and the components of access. The programme has already attracted the attention of two other regions in **Australia** interested in i**mplem**enting emergency telepsychiatry programmes. The MHEC model is a practical solution for improving acces**s to **specialist emergency mental health care in underserved areas.

7. **No longer 'flying blind': How access has changed emergency mental health care in rural and remote emergency departments, a qualitative study**
Background: Mental health presentations are considered to be a difficult aspect of **emerg**ency care. Altho**ugh e**mergency **depart**ment (ED) staff is qualified to **provi**de emergency mental health care, for some, such presentations pose a challenge to their training, confidence, and time. Providing access to relevant and responsive specialist mental health care can influence care and management for these patients. The Me**ntal **Health Emergency Care-Rural Access Program (MHEC-RAP) is a telepsychiatry program that was established to improve acces**s to **specialist emergency mental health care across rural and **remot**e western NSW, **Australia**. Method: This study uses interviews with ED providers to understand their exp**erien**ce of managing emergency mental health patients and their use of MHEC-RAP. The lens of access was applied to assess program impact and inform continuing program development. Results: With MHEC-RAP, these ED providers are no longer 'flying blind'. They are also more confident** to m**anage and care for emergency mental health patients locally. For these providers, access to specialists who are able to conduct assessments and provide relevan**t and** responsive advice for emergency mental health presentations was valued. Assessing the fit between the consumer and service as a requirement for the development, evaluation, and ongoing management of the service should result in decisions about design and delivery that achieve improved access to care and meet the needs of their consumers. The experience of these providers prior to MHEC-RAP is consistent with that reported in other rural **and r**emote populations suggesting that MHEC-RAP could address limitations in access to specialist c**are a**nd change the provision of emergency mental health care elsewhere. Conclusion: MHEC-RAP has not only provided access to specialist mental health care for local ED providers, but it has changed their practice and perspective. MHEC-RAP could be adapted for implementation elsewhere. Provider experience confirms that the program is accessible and offers insights to th**ose c**onsidering how to establish an emergency telepyschiatry service in other settings.  2015 Saurman et al.; licensee BioMed Central. eid: 2-s2.0-84928798574
8. **Assessing program efficiency: A time and motion study of the mental health emergency care - Rural access program in NSW Australia**
The Mental Health **Emerg**ency Care-Rural Access Program (MHEC-RAP) is a telehealth solution providing special**ist e**mergency mental health care to rural and **remot**e communities across western NSW, **Australia**. This is the **first** time and motion (T&M) study to examine program efficiency and capacity for a telepsychiatry program. Clinical services are an integral aspect of the program accounting for 6% of all activities and 50% of the time spent conducting program activities, but half of this time is spent completing clinical paperwork. This finding emphasizes the importance of these services to program efficiency and the need to address variability of service provision to impact capacity. Currently, there is no efficiency benchm**ark f**or emergency telepsychiatry programs. Findings suggest that MHEC-RAP could increase its activity without affecting program responsiveness. T&M studies not only determine activity and time expenditure, but have a wider application assessing program efficiency by understanding, defining, and calculating capacity. T&M studies can inform future program development of MHEC-RAP and similar telehealth programs, both** in Austr**alia and overseas.  2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland. eid: 2-s2.0-84905643979
9. **Telemental health evaluations enhance access and efficiency in a critical access hospital emergency department**
Introduction: Mentally ill patients in crisis presenting to critical access hospital **emerg**ency rooms often face exorbitant wait times to be evaluated by a trained mental health provider. Patients may be discharged from the hospital before receiving an evaluation or boarded in a hospital bed for observation, reducing quality and increasing costs. This study examined the effectiveness of** an e**mergency telemental health evaluation service implemented in a rural h**ospit**al emergency room. Materials and Methods: Retrospective data collection was implemented to consider patients presen**ting **to the emergency room for 212 days prior to telemedicine interventions and for 184 days after. The study compared measures of time to treatment, length of stay (regardless of inpatient or outpatient status), and door-to-consult time. Results: There were 24 patients seen before telemedicine was implemented and 38 seen using telemedicine. All patients had a mental health evaluation ordered by a physician and completed by a mental health specialist. Significant reductions in all three time measures were observed. Mean and median times to consult were reduced from 16.2 h (standard deviation=13.2 h) and 14.2 h, respectively, to 5.4 h (standard deviation=6.4 h) and 2.6 h. Similar reductions in length of stay and door-to-consult times were observed. By t tests, use of telemedicine was associated with a statistically significant reduction in all three outcome measures. Conclusions: Telemedicine appears to be an effective intervention for mentally ill patients by providing more timely access to mental health evaluations in** rura**l hospital emergency **depart**ments.  2014 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-84903607877
10. **Successful provision of emergency mental health care to rural and remote New South Wales: An evaluation of the Mental Health Emergency Care-Rural Access Program**
Objective To evaluate a rural **emerg**ency telepsychiatry program, the Mental Hea**lth E**mergency Care-Rural Access Program (MHEC-RAP), which aims to improve ac**cess **to emergency mental health care for communities throughout western New South Wales (NSW). Methods A descriptive analysis of service activity data from the introduction of the MHEC-RAP in 2008 to 2011 using Chi-squared tests and linear regression modelling to assess change and trends over time. Result There were 55959 calls to the MHEC-RAP, 9678 (17%) of these calls initiated an MHEC-RAP service (2500 each year). The use of video assessment increased over 18 months, then levelled off to an average of 65 each month. Health care provider use increased from 54% to 75% of all contacts, and 49% of MHEC-RAP patients were triaged 'urgent'. Most (71%) were referred from the MHEC-RAP for outpatient care with a local provider. The proportion of MHEC-RAP patients admitted to hospital initially increased by 12%, then declined over the next 2 years by 7% (by 28% for admissions to a mental health inpatient unit (MHIPU)). Conclusion The MHEC-RAP is well established. It has achieved acceptable levels of service activity and continues to be as used as intended. Further research is required to confirm how the MHEC-RAP works in terms of process and capacity, how it has changed access to mental health care and to document its costs and benefits. What is known about the topic? Rural and **remot**e communities have poorer access to and use of mental health services. Telehealth care is a reliable and accepted means for providing non-urgent mental health care. What does this paper add? The MHEC-RAP is a practical and transferable solution to providing** spec**ialist emergency mental health care, and support for local providers, in rural **and r**emote areas via telehealth. There is a possible impact upon the problem of recruiting and retaining a mental health workforce in ru**ral a**nd remote areas. What are the implications for practitioners? Providi**ng re**liable remote access to specialist mental health assessment and advice while supporting providers in rural communities can result in better outcomes for patients and services alike.

11. **Telepsychiatry in emergency consultations: A follow-up study of sixty patients**
The objective was to investigate how telepsychiatry works in the assessment of psychiatric **emerg**ency patients. Sixty consecutive patients referred to the acute open ward having their **first** psychiatric contact through the videolink with the psychiatrist on duty. Only minor technical problems occurred. The results suggest both acceptance and satisfaction on the part of patients and staff with new technology, instead of waiting for a consultation or traveling to see a psychiatrist in face-to-face meeting. Telepsychiatry seems to be suitable for the assessment of psychiat**ric e**mergency patients, and satisfactory for patients and staff alike.  Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-25844509864
12. **Telepsychiatry: An island pilot project**
A telemedicine link was established in 1996 between the island of Inishmore and the **depart**ment of psychiatry in University College Hospital, Galway. The link was mainly used to facilitate **emerg**ency consultations between patients on the island and the duty psychiatrist, always at the request of the island's general practitioner. Nine patients were referred for assessment in this manner over eight months. Three patients had their **first** psychiatric contact and assessment through the video-link, and were followed up as outpatients via the link to eventual resolution of the episode of illness and discharge at the outpatient clinic. Our experience has been that videoconferencing systems are acceptable and satisfactory for patients and staff alike. eid: 2-s2.0-0031610061
13. **Telepsychiatry in Appalachia**
Access to health care continues to be one of the major challenges to individuals, communities, and policy makers. In rural areas, the challenges are especially acute. This article examines the use of digital technology to provide health care services to underserved communities. An experimental telepsychiatry program is used to illustrate the promise and the obstacles to using technology to link communities to advanced health care services. eid: 2-s2.0-0030549649
14. **A comparison study of the turnaround time for telepsychiatry versus face-to-face consultations in general hospital nonpsychiatric emergency rooms**
background: Psychiatric consultation services, particularly for **emerg**encies, are limited in many parts of the United States. Telepsychiatry services are helping to bridge the gap, and are gaining acceptance and popularity. There is paucity of publications regarding comparison of turnaround time for consultations between video conferencing and traditional face-to-face psychiatric consultations in general hospital nonpsychiat**ric e**mergency **depart**ments (EDs). Our study aimed to address turnaround time and patient satisfaction. methods: Data regarding the turnaround t**ime f**or emergency psychiatric consultations using telepsychiatry in general hospital EDs was collected retrospectively and compared with the time for face-to-face traditional consultations. A patient satisfaction survey was also conducted after the telepsychiatry consultation. Statistical analysis of the data was done after the study was completed. results: The telepsychiatry group included 206 participants and the control group had 186 participants. There was an 84% reduction in the turnaround time for telepsychiatry consults (95% confidence interval, 81% to 86%). A patient satisfaction survey showed 97% satisfaction with telepsychiatry services. Gender and age did not modify the effect of telepsychiatry on time to consult (P > .10). conclusions: The reduction in the turnaround time and improved patient satisfaction indicate that telepsychiatry services can improve the quality of care for patients** in n**eed of emergency services.  2020 Quadrant Healthcom Inc..

0. **Demographic and psychiatric predictors of engagement in psychotherapy services conducted via clinical video telehealth**
Introduction: Military **veteran**s are at high risk for developing mental health problems. Unfortunate**ly, vet**erans have relatively low rates of engagement in mental health services compared w**ith non**-veterans. In order to address barriers to mental health care se**rvices,** the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) has implemented clinical video telehealth (CVT). Although the effectiveness of this technology appears promising, there is limited research evaluating rates of engagement in CVT mental health services or what factors may predict premature attrition from mental health care delivered via this format. Methods: The present study aimed to investigate treatment e**ngageme**nt among veterans enrolled in psychotherapy delivered via CVT, as well as to explore the effects of various demographic and clinical characteristics on these outcomes. Pa**rticipa**nts were 250 veterans with consults placed to the CVT clinic at a large Midwestern VHA. To evaluate characteristics related to therapy retention, demographic and symptom profile information was gathered from a subset of 93 participants who attended at least one CVT psychotherapy appointment. Results: Results indicated there were no significant demograp**hic dif**ferences between veterans who attended at least one CVT appointment and those who did not attend at least one session. Demographic variables were not related to the number of CVT visits attended. Regarding psy**chologi**cal characteristics, veterans with anxiety disorders attended fewe**r CVT a**ppointments overall than veterans with mood disorders and attendance at CVT was negatively correlated with anxiety severity. Discussion: These findings have potential implications for providers working in CVT clinics as well as for future research in this area.  The Author(s) 2018. eid: 2-s2.0-85059667168

2. **RCT of a brief phone-based CBT intervention to improve PTSD treatment utilization by returning service members**
Objectives: Many service members do not seek care for mental health and addiction problems, often with serious consequences for them, their families, and their communities. This study tested the effectiveness of a brief, telephone-based, cognitive-behavioral intervention designed to improve treatment engagement among returning service members who screened positive for **posttraumat**ic **stress** disorder (**PTSD**). Methods: Service members who had served in Operation Enduring Freedom or Operation Iraqi Freedom who screened positive **for **PTSD but had not eng**aged** in PTSD treatment were recruited (N=300), randomly assigned to either control or intervention conditions, and administered a baseline interview. Intervention participants received a brief cognitive-behavioral therapy intervention; participants in the control condition had access to usual services. All participants received follow-up phone calls at months 1, 3, and 6 to assess symptoms and service utilization. Results: Participants in both conditions had comparable rates of treatment eng**agem**ent and PTSD symptom reduction over the course of the six-month trial, but receiving the telephonebased intervention accelerated service utilization (treatment engagement and number o**f se**ssions) and PTSD symptom reduction. Conclusions: A one-time brief telephone intervention can engage** ser**vice members in PTSD treatment earlier than conventional methods and can lead to immediate symptom reduction. There were no differences at longer-term follow-up, suggesting the need for additional intervention to build upon initial gains.  2014, American Psychiatric Association.

3. **Posttraumatic stress disorder treatment for operation enduring freedom/operation iraqi freedom combat veterans through a civilian community-based telemedicine network**
Background: Telemedicine holds great potential to improve access to care and to reduce barriers to treatment for military populations with **posttraumat**ic **stress** disorder (**PTSD**). This study sought to integrate the use of telemedicine mental health treatment services by a community healthcare provider to military populations residing in a rural location and to compare the equivalency of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) administered via telemedicine and traditional face-to-face therapy. Subjects and Methods: Study subjects were men or women 18 years of age or older who had served in Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and/or Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and were diagnosed w**ith **PTSD. The 18 study subjects were randomized and provided 10 weekly therapy sessions of CBT. Pre- and post-intervention assessments were conducted using the Clinician Admin**iste**red PTSD Scale (CAPS), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), Montgomery-Asberg **Depress**ion Rating Scale (MADRS), Life Events Checklist, and SF-36v2 (QualityMetric, Lincoln, RI) Health Survey. Results: The CAPS, HAM-A, and MADRS each demonstrated lower scores, signifying improvement, and 69% of subjects experienced a clinically significant change in the CAPS. Patient satisfaction results indicated greater satisfaction for telemedicine as opposed to traditional face-to-face treatment. Conclusions: Findings reveal a trend expressing the equivalence of telemedicine and face-to-face therapy when treating OEF/OIF ve**tera**ns with PTSD among rural populations by a community provider. It further demonstrates the successful collaboration between a community healthcare provider and the military healthcare system. Copyright  2014, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-84900027015
4. **Are Community Studies of Psychological Trauma's Impact Accurate? A Study Among Jews and Palestinians**
We evaluated the accuracy of **posttraumat**ic **stress** disorder (**PTSD**) and major **depress**ion (MD) diagnoses using brief assessment instruments conducted by pho**ne. **PTSD and MD were assessed by telephone interview in a randomly selected sample of Jewish and Palestinian residents of Jerusalem (N = 150) during a period of marked threat of terrorism and war. We utili**zed **the PTSD Symptom Scale Interview Format (Foa, Riggs, Dancu, & Rothbaum, 1993) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9; Kroenke, Spitzer, & Williams, 2001). We then conducted in-depth, in-person interviews within 2 weeks**, as**sessing PTSD and MD using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI; Kessler et al., 2004). Th**e pr**evalence of PTSD and MD diagnosis ascertained by the 2 assessment modalities was similar. Indices of classification accuracy for the phone interview, using the in-person interview as the standard, ranged from modest to high. Brief phone and in-depth in**-per**son measures of PTSD and MD also correlated similarly with other demograph**ic, st**ress, and coping factors, suggesting convergent validity. Brief phone interviews appear useful for estimating the prevalence of psychological disorders in mass casualty contexts and may have a critical role in both epidemiologic work and guiding public health interventions.  2011 American Psychological Association. eid: 2-s2.0-80052649535
5. **Randomized controlled equivalence trial comparing videoconference and in person delivery of cognitive processing therapy for PTSD**
Introduction: In an effort to improve access to and utilization of health care, the **Veteran**s Health Administration (VHA) continues to investigate the effectiveness of video-teleconferencing (VTC) technologies for service delivery. While previous research focused on the efficacy of VTC treatment for post-traumatic **stress** disorder (**PTSD**) in Vietnam **era vet**erans, few studies have evaluated the efficacy of this modality and treatment for the Iraq/Afghanis**tan era** veterans. The aim of this randomized clinical trial was to evaluate equivalence between **in person** and VTC psychotherapy **for **PTSD in this newer cohor**t. Meth**ods: Veterans of the Iraq/Afghanistan conflict from two VHA hospitals in the United States were recruited and randomized to receive cognitive processing therapy (C**PT) **for PTSD eit**her in pe**rson (IP) or over VTC. Clinician-administered and self-report measures were collected before, during, and after treatment. Results: A trend was observed which suggested that CPT over VTC may be equivalent to the treatment de**livered i**n person, as suggested by previous studies. Regardles**s of tr**eatment, veterans who received the intervention in both conditions reported significant decreases on post-treatment measures. Discussion: This study highlighted research and clinical challenges in providing ser**vices t**o the newest veteran generation in general as well as unique challenges with VTC. One complicating factor to the statistical power of this study was a treatment dropout rate twice the original estimate. Factors that could have influenced this high dropout rate are explored.  2015,  The Author(s) 2015. eid: 2-s2.0-84971468403
6. **Telemedicine: A cost-reducing means of delivering psychotherapy to rural combat veterans with PTSD**
Background: Although effective psychotherapies for **posttraumat**ic **stress** disorder (**PTSD**) exist, high percentages of **Veteran**s in need of services are unable to access them. One particular challenge to providing cost-effective psychological treatments** to Vet**erans w**ith **PTSD involves the difficulty and high cost of delivering in-person, specialized psychothe**rapy to** Veterans residing in geographically remote locations. The delivery of these services via clinical videoteleconferencing (CVT) has been presented as a potential solution to this access to care problem. Materials and Methods: This study is a retrospective cost analysis of a randomized controlled trial investigating telemedicine service delivery of an anger management therapy for Vetera**ns w**ith PTSD. The parent trial found that the CVT condition provided clinical results that were comparable to the in-person condition. Several cost outcomes were calculated in order to investigate the clinical and cost outcomes associated with the CVT delivery modality relative to in-person delivery. Results: The CVT condition was significantly associated with lower total costs compared with the in-person delivery condition. The delivery of mental health services via **CVT ena**bles Veterans who would not normally receive these services access to empirically based treatments. Additional studies addressing long-term healthcare system costs, indirect cost factors at the patient and societal levels, and the use of CVT in other geographic regions of the United States are needed. Conclusions: The results of this study provide evidence that CVT is a cost-reducing mode of service delivery to Ve**tera**ns with PTSD relative to in-person delivery.

7. **BEHAVIORAL ACTIVATION and THERAPEUTIC EXPOSURE for POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER: A NONINFERIORITY TRIAL of TREATMENT DELIVERED in PERSON VERSUS HOME-BASED TELEHEALTH**
Objective Combat **veteran**s returning to society with impairing mental health conditions such as **PTSD** and major **depress**ion (MD) report significant barriers to care related to aspects of traditional psychotherapy service delivery (e.g., stigma, travel time, and cost). Hence, alternate treatment delivery methods are needed. Home-based telehealth (HBT) is one such option; however, this delivery mode has not been compared to **in person**, clinic-based care **for **PTSD in adequately powered trials. The present study was designed to compare relative noninferiority of evidence-based psychotherap**ies **for PTSD and MD, specifically Behavioral Activation and Therapeutic Exposure (BA-TE), when delivered via HBT ver**sus in pe**rson, in clinic delivery. Method A repeated measures (i.e., baseline, posttreatment, 3-, 6-month follow-up) randomized controlled design powered for noninferiority analyses was used** to **compare PTSD and MD symptom improvement in response to BA-TE delivered via HBT** versus i**n person, in clinic conditions. Participants were **232 vet**erans diagnosed with full criteria or predefin**ed s**ubthre**shol**d PTSD. Results PTSD and MD symptom improvement following BA-TE delivered by HBT was comparable to that of BA-T**E deliver**ed in person at posttreatment and at 3- and 12-month follow-up. Conclusion Evidence-**base**d psychotherapy for PTSD **and dep**ression can be safely and effectively delivered via HBT with clinical outcomes paralleling those of clinic-based** care del**ivered in person. HBT, thereby, addresses barriers to care related to both logistics and stigma.  2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-84964643214
8. **A randomized trial of telepsychiatry for post-traumatic stress disorder**
We compared the efficacy of telepsychiatry and same-room treatment of combat-related post-traumatic **stress** disorder (**PTSD**) using cognitive behavioural therapy in 14 weekly, 90-min treatment sessions. Of 97 patients referred for study participation, 38 were randomized (17 into telepsychiatry, 21 into same-room), and approximately 25 (the number differed by instrument) had at least one post-baseline assessment. Measures of clinical and process outcomes were examined. No group differences were found on clinical outcomes at threemonth follow-up. Satisfaction with treatment ratings was similar in both groups, with 'strong satisfaction' indicated by **veteran**s in both modalities. Attendance and drop-out were similar in the two groups. The sameroom group reported more comfort in talking with their therapist at post-treatment and had better treatment adherence. The results provide preliminary support for the use of telepsychiatry in the treatment** of **PTSD to improve access to care. eid: 2-s2.0-34548423717
9. **Bipolar disorder and PTSD screening and telepsychiatry diagnoses in primary care**
Objective: To describe clinical diagnoses from telepsychiatrist consultation in safety net primary care settings for adult patients screening positive for bipolar disorder, **PTSD**, or both. Methods: Patients were administered **the **PTSD Checklist (PCL-6) and the Composite International Diagnostic Interview 3.0 (CIDI) for bipolar disorder. Positive screening result definitions were PCL-6 score of 14 and CIDI positive stem question responses and score of 8. Patient characteristics were assessed by survey. Psychiatrists consulted in primary care via telehealth and recorded clinical diagnoses. Results: Among 767 patients attending consultation with a telepsychiatrist, 495 (65%) screened PCL-6 positive only, 249 (32%) screened both PCL-6 and CIDI positive, and 23 (3%) screened CIDI positive. Approximately two-thirds screening PCL-6 positive were diagnos**ed w**ith PTSD, and most had comorbid mood disorder diagnoses, with bipolar disorder diagnosis occurring more often in those screening CIDI positive compared to negative (42% vs. 15%). Positive predictive values were 64.9% for PCL-6 and 43.8% for CIDI. Conclusion: Most individuals screening p**osit**ive for PTSD and/or bipolar disorder had two or more psychiatric diagnoses; misclassification exists for both instruments but was greater for CIDI. Psychiatrist consultation early in treatment for individuals screening positive on the PCL-6 and/or CIDI could help clarify diagnoses and improve treatment planning.  2020 The Authors eid: 2-s2.0-85084993436
10. **Changes in Coping and Negative Cognitions as Mechanisms of Change in Online Treatment for Rape-Related Posttraumatic Stress Disorder**
Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)based interventions, including those administered via telepsychology, represent efficacious **posttraumat**ic **stress** disorder (**PTSD**) treatments. Despite demonstrated efficacy, limited research has examined mechanisms of change for CBT. We examined trauma-related cognitions and coping as treatment mechanisms among 46 women who completed a randomized clinical trial of a CBT-based, telepsychology-delivered interactive program for rape survivors. The results indicated that both the interactive program, d = 1.5, and the active control condition, a psychoeducational website, d = 1.4, resulted in large reductions in postt**est **PTSD symptoms. Analysis of residual gain scores showed that reductions in the three types of assessed trauma-related cognitions were strongly related to reduct**ions** in PTSD symptoms among women assigned to the interactive program, rs =.60.79, but only weakly related to symptom reduction among those assigned to active control, rs =.06.31. The results also suggest that increases in trauma-related approach coping were weakly related to re**duct**ions in PTSD symptoms among participants in the interactive program, rs = .16 and .17, but, conversely, decreases in trauma-related approach coping were weakly related t**o re**ductions in PTSD symptoms among those in the active control group, rs =.07 and.28. Reductions in avoidance coping were modestly relat**ed t**o reductions in PTSD symptoms among women in the interactive program, rs =.38 and.38, but **unre**lated to changes in PTSD symptoms among those assigned to the active control, rs =.03 and.05. Implications for future work examini**ng m**echanisms of change for PTSD treatments are discussed.  2019 International Society for Trauma**tic St**ress Studies eid: 2-s2.0-85075531204
11. **Veterans prospective attitudes about mental health treatment using telehealth**
The current study examined **Veteran**s attitudes about the potential use of telepsychiatry for mental health treatment in routine clinical settings. Data were collected f**rom Vet**eran outpatients (N = 253) who completed a series of self-report screening measures as part of their initial evaluation at an outpatient clinic providing **care to** Veterans with deployment-related mental health problems. Using a de-identified data repository, symptoms of **posttraumat**ic **stress** disorder (**PTSD**), **depress**ion, anxiety, **and st**ress, as well as attitudes and level of comfort with receiving treatment through telehealth were assessed. Overall interest in telepsychiatry was mixed, with 25.7% of patients being not at all comfortable and 13.4% being extremely comfortable using telepsychiatry from home. Approximately one third (32.8%) of participants indicated a clear preference for telepsychiatry compared to in-person mental health visits. There were no differences in telepsychiatry preferences by symptom severity, demographic variables, rural versus urban location, or endorsed barriers to care. Although telepsychiatry may be a viable means of increasing access, patient preference should be considered, as a substantial pe**rcentag**e of Veterans in this study preferred in-person visits.

12. **Early treatment withdrawal from evidence-based psychotherapy for PTSD: Telemedicine and in-person parameters**
Objective: To determine differences in reported barriers to treatment completion associated with telemedicine vs. in-person delivery of evidence-based treatment for **PTSD** in combat **veteran**s. Method: The present study was derived from two ongoing randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing in-person vs. telemedicine delivery of exposure therapy **for **PTSD. A onetime telephone assessment of participants who dropped out from the treatment phase of these two studies was conducted, with measures focusing on reported reasons for dropout, and perceived comfort and efficacy of the treatment modality. Dichotomous data were analyzed via chi-square and logistic regression; continuous data via ANOVA. Results: Forty-seven of 69 total dropouts participated. There was no difference in rate of dropout between modalities. A greater proportion of participants receiving in-person exposure therapy reported difficulties with logistical aspects of care (e.g., parking), whereas a greater proportion of participants receiving telemedicine therapy reported difficulty tolerating certain **stress**ful aspects of treatment; however, those receiving telemedicine delivered treatment completed more sessions before dropping out. Participants in both conditions reported that they liked and were confident in their therapist Conclusions: Dropout reasons varied according to type of treatment delivery. Recommendations for future research are given in terms of modification of treatment protocol according to delivery modality.  2014, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-84988260168

0. **Are There Other Options?: Child and Adolescent Telepsychiatry Services for Rural Population**
This study compared University of Missouri **child** and **adolesc**ent telepsychiatry services patients specific zip codes** to c**hild **and ado**lescent psychiatrists practice locations to learn if telehealth was an appropriate option for this group of patients. In demographically and geographically diverse state such as Missouri, patients in rural areas may have limited or no access to timely, affordable and quality care. Many large urban health-care institutions have turned to telehealth as a means of providing equal access to care for all population, no matter where they choose to live. The management analyst system Cognos/Analyzer was used as a data source. Patient- and provider-specific zip codes were processed using GeoKettle software, and ArcGIS explorer was used for map visualization. While patients ut**ilizi**ng ch**ild and** adolescent telepsychiatry services come from various parts of the state, providers are mostly clustered in urban locations along the Interstate 70. This greatly limits access to specialty care for rural and other vulnerable populations. Telehealth provides adequate and timel**y acc**ess t**o child** and adolescent psychiatry services for the youth that may otherwise not be able to get needed care. Barriers such as mental health crisis and access to care for rural population have been more or less successfully addressed by telehealth for several decades now. However, the shortage of specialty physicians adds an additional layer of complexity to this issue. Health-care organizations with informatics tools such as telemedicine need to focus their efforts on maximizing usage to allow more access for the underserved population.  2016 Indian Institute of Health Management Research. eid: 2-s2.0-84977570445
1. **School-Based Telepsychiatry in an Urban Setting: Efficiency and Satisfaction with Care**
Background and Introduction: Given the shortage of **child** psychiatrists in most areas, telepsychiatry may increase accessibility of psychiatric care in schools, in part by improving psychiatrists' efficiency and reach. The current study assessed consumer and provider **satisfact**ion with school-based telepsychiatry versus in-person sessions in 25 urban public schools and compared the efficiency of these service delivery models. Materials and Methods: In total, **714 satis**faction surveys were completed by parents, students, school clinicians, **and c**hild psychiatrists following initial (26.3%) and follow-up (67.2%) visits (6.4% did not indicate type of visit). Most of these surveyed visits were for medication management (69.9%) or initiation of medication (22%). Efficiency analyses compared time saved via telepsychiatry versus in-person care. Researchers also conducted focus groups with providers to clarify preferences and concerns about telepsychiatry versus in-person visits. Results: Consumers were highly satisfied with both in-person and telepsychiatry-provided school psychiatry services and showed no significant differences in preference. Providers reported both in-person and telepsychiatry were equally effective and showed a slight preference for in-person sessions, citing concerns about ease of video equipment use. Telepsychiatry services were more efficient than in-person services, as commute/setup occupied about 28 psychiatrist hours total per month. Discussion and Conclusions: Findings suggest that students, parents, and school clinicians perceive school-based telepsychiatry positively and equal to on-sit**e car**e. **Child psychiatri**sts have apprehension about using equipment, so equipment training/preparation and provision of technical support are needed. Implications of study findings for telepsychiatry training and implementation in schools are discussed.  2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2020. eid: 2-s2.0-85077861024
2. **Telepsychiatry in a Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Service**
Objectives: To carry out a survey on the use of video conferencing equipment by a rural **child** psychiatric multidisciplinary team and to determine what impact the introduction of this equipment had on service provision. Method: Several aspects were studied including user **satisfact**ion and estimations of cost saving, on the basis of avoidance of travel to and from the regional base in Galway. A questionnaire was also developed to determine whether alternative contact would have been made if if this new technology were not in place. Results: The results of the initial six months following commencement were investigated. Use of the equipment was attempted 17 times during this period. Most members of **the c**hild psychiatry team participated in its use. Visual problems accounted for 66.7% of reported technical difficulty and 88.9% of users rated their level** of satis**faction with the equipment as 'Satisfied' or 'Very Satisfied'. Conclusions: Apart from the start-up cost implications of installing this equipment, it satisfied its aim of increasing contact between the rural service and St** Anne**'s Children Centre in Galway. The equipment was easy to use and for the most part reliable. eid: 2-s2.0-33750492301
3. **Telepsychiatry with child welfare families referred to a family service agency**
A telepsychology and telepsychiatry service, using ISDN interactive video H.320, providing psychological consultations for the Family Resource Center in Farmington, New Mexico, was **evalu**ated. During the first year of service, 56 individuals participated including University of New Mexico staff, Family Resource Center staff and clients. Consultations involved **child**ren from families referred by **the C**hildren, Youth and Family Department (CYFD) in New Mexico. Telemedicine was used **in so**me child abuse cases. This study investigated whether the quality and acceptance of telemedicine consultations were comparable to face-to-face interactions in a group referred** by a** state child welfare agency. Participants received formal written consultation reports after the video conferencing sessions, which included a number of recommendations. Participants were asked to complete an anonymous questionnaire to rate various aspects of videoconferencing. The participants rated the university staff as involved, enjoyed the Family Resource Center staff's presence, felt the procedure was useful **for e**valuation purposes, found the format allowed for discussions of problems, and felt that the format was useful when compared to face-to-face consultations. The participants also said they had followed up on many of the recommendations. Videoconferencing appears to be a viable approach for providing consultation for families refe**rred **by a state child welfare agency. Several participants rated the session as both educational and consultative compared to simply therapeutic. eid: 2-s2.0-15344349269
4. **Mental health services for Nunavut children and youth: Evaluating a telepsychiatry pilot project**
Introduction: This study examines the delivery of psychiatric consultation services using videoconferencing technology to health and mental health workers in the Nunavut territory of Canada. The research provides insights into the TeleLink Mental Health Program and the delivery of professional-to-professional program consultations and continuing education seminars. Methods: Participant observation of 12 program consultations and four continuing education sessions was conducted. Individual interviews were conducted with the consulting psychiatrist and the lead program coordinator in Nunavut. As well, a focus group was held with Nunavut workers who participated in the televideo sessions. Results: The study found a number of factors that facilitated or hindered the process and content of a consultation-based telepsychiatry program and its effect on building capacity among frontline staff. Four main themes emerged related to the delivery of psychiatric services via televideo: gaining access, ensuring culturally appropriate services, providing relevant continuing education, and offering stable and confidential technology. Conclusions: Live interactive videoconferencing technology is an innovative and effective way of delivering specialized **mental health servic**es to professionals working in remote areas of Nunavut. Study results provide important strategies for expanding this approach to other jurisdictions in Nunavut and other Inuit regions.  T Volpe, KM Boydell, A Pignatiello, 2014. eid: 2-s2.0-84904618501
5. **Telepsychiatry: Addressing mental health needs in Georgia**
Creation of a comprehensive mental health telecommunications system to serve isolated persons in Georgia, resulting in a more equitable distribution of mental health resources, is the goal of the telepsychiatry program at the Medical College of Georgia. Although telepsychiatric consultation is not a new idea, the 'distribution' of telepsychiatry through additional integrated telecommunications channels such as the World Wide Web is a distinctive approach. This report describes the history of the development of the MCG Telepsychiatry Program. Through the use of a multichanneled telecommunications system, a more equitable distribution of mental health resources is underway in Georgia. eid: 2-s2.0-0033816892
6. **Attracting child psychiatrists to a televideo consultation service: The telelink experience**
Objective. Identify aspects of psychiatry work that are rewarding, as well as those that are challenging, from the perspective of psychiatrists and residents participating in televideo consultation services. Method. A web-based survey was distributed to psychiatrists within the Division of **Child** Psychiatry at the University of Toronto. Also, semistructured interviews were conducted with **six c**hild psychiatrists providing services to a telepsychiatry program. Finally, a focus group interview was held with four psychiatry residents. R**esult**s. **Child psychiatri**sts are very comfortable conducting assessments via televideo. Factors identified as being important in the decision to participate in telepsychiatry include assisting underserved communities, supportive administrative staff, enhanced rural provider capacity, financial incentives, and convenience. The study's qualitative phase identified four themes in the decision to participate in telepsychiatry: (1) organizational, (2) shared values, (3) innovation, and (4) the consultation model. Conclusion. The success of televideo consultation programs in** attr**act**ing child psychi**atrists to provide consultation services to underresourced communities makes an important contribution to psychiatric workforce shortages. Understanding what aspects of telepsychiatry are most appreciated by consulting psychiatrists and residents offers useful strategies to telepsychiatry administrators and medical school educators seeking to attract, train, and retain psychiatry practitioners.  2013 Tiziana Volpe et al. eid: 2-s2.0-84880149736
7. **Telepsychiatry improves paediatric behavioural health care in rural communities**
In the US, **child**ren with special health care needs are underserved by both the medical and educational systems. This problem is especially serious in rural states. Telemedicine is a technique that can reduce these gaps in service and help connect the two systems. The technology required has become cheaper and more accessible. Progress on reimbursement for such services has also been made. For some years, we have provided telepsychiatry **for c**hildren in Washington State using videoconferencing. Interviews with families and service providers were conducted in Washington and Missouri. Some parents reported tha**t the**ir child actually preferred telepsychiatry to conventional consultation. The telepsychiatry service model was built on the existing system of outreach clinics, thus involving specialists who were familiar with the community and who were known and trusted by the community. Before starting, we ensured that all relevant service delivery agencies and providers were comfortable about using videoconferencing as a method of service delivery. In the 18-month period ending in March 2003, three providers in Seattle saw 159 patients by telepsychiatry and 210 patients face-to-face at the hospital clinic. The main barrier to further growth of the telepsychiatry service is the absence of reimbursement for telepsychiatry. eid: 2-s2.0-34548040642
8. **E-CYMHS: An expansion of a child and youth telepsychiatry model in Queensland**
Objectives: The purpose of this study was to describe the evolution of the E-**Child** and Youth **Mental Health Servic**e (E-CYMHS), which supports regional and ru**ral mental health se**rvices by providing access to consult**ant c**hild and **adolesc**ent psychiatrists to isolated staff in regional areas, where access to specialist psychiatric services is limited. Conclusions: E-CYMHS provides a level of parity in mental health care between metropolitan, regional and remote services through the provision of regular videoconferencing servic**es wi**th child **and ado**lescent psychiatrists and senior allied health clinicians. The three key features which underpin the success of the service are: 1. A central co-ordinator of services; 2. Provision of support outside regular videoconference times; and 3. Routine outreach visits that foster community capacity-building. E-CYMHS has been well received by the r**egional mental healt**h services it supports, and the total provision of services has more than doubled over the last three years. It is anticipated that as telepsychiatry is increasingly viewed as a credible alternative to traditional means of patient care, this trend is likely to continue.  2012 The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists. eid: 2-s2.0-84872155638
9. **Ten-year experience of a private nonprofit telepsychiatry service**
This paper reports the results of a **satisfact**ion survey of telepsychiatry patients at a rural community mental health clinic that had been providing psychiatric services solely via telemedicine for 10 years. The survey examined the perceived telepsychiatric session quality over a relatively long period of time with patients who had been utilizing the services for a number of years or over multiple sessions. Onepage optional anonymous surveys were distributed from December 1, 2006, through March 30, 2007, covering 230 telepsychiatry patients, approximately 90% of current telepsychiatry patients at the agency. Of these, 76 patients responded, a 33.0% return rate. Among the responden**ts, satis**faction was generally very high, with telemedicine services provided over a period of up to 10 years perceived to be of similar (no worse) quality than in-person services. Results were further analyzed by gender, age, and number of telemedicine sessions experienced. Female patients appeared more accepting of the quality of medical care via telemedicine than male patients. Patients aged 20-49 had much higher acceptance rates than patients younger than 20 or older than 49. The least positive responses toward telemedicine were from patients in their 50s. Patients who had experienced 5 to 10 telemedicine sessions were more likely than patients who had experienced fewer than 5 to report that their sessions now run more smoothly than their initial sessions. Patients in their 20s and 30s reported the least need to have a clinician in the room with them to make them feel comfortable during their telemedicine sessions. Eight percent of respondents reacted negatively to the presence of a clinician in the room with them during their telemedicine sessions.

10. **The experience in Victoria with telepsychiatry for the child and adolescent mental health service**
In 1995, the Royal **Child**ren's Hospital **Mental Health Servic**e in Melbourne developed the first telepsychiatry programme** in c**hild and **adolesc****ent mental health se**rvices (CAMHS) in Australia. A survey of 25 CAMHS clinicians in five rural regions who had used videoconferencing showed that 64% had used the technology for more than 18 months, and 20% had used it for 7-12 months. Also, 60% had used the technology on over 30 occasions, and 24% had used it on 20-29 occasions. Respondents clearly recognized its benefits in terms of their increased knowledge and skills (96%), strengthening of relationships with colleagues (92%) and decreased sense of isolation (92%). To build on the success of telepsychiatry there are a number of challenges that health service managers will need to address. Telepsychiatry works most effectively as a tool to complement face-to-face contact. It cannot be promoted as the total solution to the issue of isolation from mainstream services. eid: 2-s2.0-0035232380
11. **Establishing a telepsychiatry consultation practice in rural Georgia for primary care physicians: A feasibility report**
Objective. One approach to solving mental health care disparity issues in rural areas is by establishing a telepsychiatry consultation practice for **child**ren, in which a psychiatrist see**s a c**hild via videoconferencing for a limited number of sessions and then provides a treatment plan **to th**at child's primary care physician and family. Method. The present study offered a 2-session telepsychiatry consultation clinic, consisting of a psychiatric **evalu**ation session and a recommendation session, with patients located remotely in rural Georgia. Results. Fifteen consult**ation**s with children aged 4 to 18 years (M = 9.73, SD = 3.39) with varying diagnoses were completed. Parental **satisfact**ion with the telepsychiatry consultation model was high, overall mean of 4.58 (SD = 0.63) on a 5-point scale (n = 11). Conclusion.** Esta**blishing a child telepsychiatry consultation practice is feasible in rural areas.

12. **From pilot to permanent service: Ten years of paediatric telepsychiatry**
The **Child** and **Adolesc**ent Psychological Telemedicine Outreach Service (CAPTOS) in Sydney has been providing telepsychiatry services in New South Wales (NSW) for ten years. Services are provided to over 40 sites in remote and rural NSW. There are eight telepsychiatry clinics a week, providing almost 600 consultations a year. As well as telepsychiatry, three additional services are provided: professional supervision, education and training, and Aborigi**nal c**hild **and ado**lescent mental health traineeships. The service was re-**evalu**ated in 2004 using a semi-structured interview to obtain information about service **satisfact**ion and effectiveness from hub and rural clinicians. There continues to be a high level** of satis**faction with the telepsychiatry service and with other telemedicine services, such as clinical supervision and teaching. Videoconferencing appears to be a highly effective and well accepted method of providing mental health care to remote an**d rur**al ch**ildren,** adolescents and families. CAPTOS has developed into an integ**ral p**art o**f child** and adolescent **mental health servic**es in remote and rural New South Wales. eid: 2-s2.0-37549031375
13. **Assessment of SUNY Upstate medical university's child telepsychiatry consultation program**
Objectives: The project assesses the **child** telepsychiatry services provided by SUNY Upstate psychiatrists to several county mental health clinics in central New York State. Method: Data for 45 patients was extracted from pre-consultation forms completed by the referring clinic and postconsultation summaries completed by the Upstate psychiatrists that occurred between July 13, 2009 and May 12, 2010. The study identified characteristics of patients for whom telepsychiatry consultations were sought, why they were sought, and reviewed recommended changes in therapy and medication provided by the telepsychiatry consultant. Results: Analysis of the data showed that there was a large variation in patient characteristics such as age (from age 3 to 17), current living situation, and psychological symptoms. In addition to a family history of mental illness (80%), the most common symptoms were physical aggression (60.0%), defiant/oppositional behavior (57.8%), and attentional problems (55.6%). The most common reason for referral was diagnostic clarification (67%). **The c**hild telepsychiatrist recommended a change in medication for most (80.8%) of the patients who were on medications, and to begin medications for most (63.2%) who were not receiving medication at the time of consult. Further, the telepsychiatrist often recommended the addition of family therapy (71.1%) and counseling at school (17.8%). Conclusi**on: T**he child telepsychiatric program at Upstate seemed effective. It reached a large** vari**ety of children with significant mental disorders. The consultants provided diagnostic clarification and recommended modification of treatment for most. However, this assessment is limited as examined as it did not include follow-up information on whether consultant recommendations were followed and, if they were, whether they were effective.  2011, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-81755188307
14. **A statewide child telepsychiatry consult system yields desired health system changes and savings**
Background: Telepsychiatry has clinical efficacy with **child**ren, but questions remain about cost-effectiveness. State agencies and health systems need to know i**f a c**hild telepsychiatry consult system can address system concerns and improve care quality while lowering costs. Materials and Methods: To assist care in a rural state w**ith f**ew child and **adolesc**ent psychiatrists, an academic center coordinated a consult system of (1) televideo consults for** high**-needs children with Medicaid and state Multidisciplinary Team (MDT)/foster care involvement, (2) remote medication reviews for beyond guidelines prescribing, and (3) elective community provider telephone-based consults. Consult service data were collected and analyzed with Wyoming's Medicaid and Foster Care Divisions between the program start in January 2011 until March 2013. Results: There were 229 televideo MDT/foster care consults, 125 mandatory medication reviews, and 277 elective phone consultations supporting community providers during this period. Following implementation, the num**ber o**f Medicaid children 5 years of age using psychotropic medications decreased by 42% (p<0.001)**, and** the number of children using psychotropic doses >150% of the Food and Drug Administration maximum decreased by 52% (p<0.001). Televideo con**sults** redirected 60% of children slated by caseworkers for a psychiatric residential treatment facility admission into alternative community treatment and placements. A financial return on investment was 1.82 to 1 for combined services. Co**nclus**ions: This coordinated child telepsychiatry consult system for a state Medicaid division reduced outlier pediatric psychiatric medication prescribing, supported local community-delivered treatments, and reduced unnecessary hospitalizations in a financially advantageous manner that was well received by the practice community.  2015, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-84936936665
15. **Improved access to mental health evaluation for patients with developmental disabilities using telepsychiatry**
The Cedars-Sinai Telepsychiatry Clinic uses a collaborative-care model to treat patients with developmental disabilities. We examined its practice in four areas: patient characteristics, clinical care, symptom severity and diagnostic outcomes to describe the care provided and the population seen in the telepsychiatry clinic. In a chart review, 45 out of 126 cases were selected and **evalu**ated at three times: init**ial e**valuation, year one and year three. Most of the patients (84%) had an intellectual disability, 55% had a pervasive developmental disorder and 71% spoke approximately 50 words or less. Prior to the initial assessment, none of the patients were diagnosed with anxiety or mood disorders, while almost one-third of patients received one of these diagnoses in the telepsychiatry clinic. Patients were seen six times on average in the fi{ligature}rst year and three times in the second and third years. The telepsychiatrist recommended a change in the patient's medication for 82% of patients at initial assessment, 41% at year one and 46% at year three. The review suggests that telepsy**chiat**ry evaluations can be valuable for patients with developmental disabilities, providing diagnostic clarity and specifi{ligature}c recommendations that can be implemented by the primary care physician. eid: 2-s2.0-84865826955
16. **A review of the outcomes of the recommendations made during paediatric telepsychiatry consultations**
Little is known about whether the recommendations made during telepsychiatry are actually implemented. We reviewed 100 telepsychiatry consultations, chosen randomly from a paediatric telepsychiatry programme serving rural communities in Ontario. Treatment recommendations had been made for each case reviewed and up to nine recommendations had been made for a single case. Twenty-seven percent of recommendations revolved around monitoring (10%), changing (9%), starting (4%), continuing (3%) and stopping (1%) medication. Case managers associated with 54 of the cases were interviewed to determine whether the recommendations had been implemented and to examine the barriers and facilitators to implementation. The results indicated that cooperation of both **child** and parent, clear communication of recommendations, involvement of the school and local health providers, stability of the agencies and availability of services were key components in the successful implementation of recommendations. The matter of technology or technological difficulties acting as a barrier to telepsychiatric consultations was not mentioned by case managers, suggesting that it was not a problem. eid: 2-s2.0-40149096886
17. **Effect of a behavioural health and specialty care telemedicine programme on goal attainment for youths in juvenile detention**
We conducted a pre-post study of the effect of a telepsychiatry counselling service on youths housed in three juvenile detention facilities. In the first year of the telemedicine programme, 321 psychiatry consultations were conducted via telemedicine; in the second year of the programme, 573 psychiatry consultations were conducted. Records for 190 students were then examined by two raters. The total number of behavioural goals for each **adolesc**ent increased from 8.2 in the pre-telemedicine year to 8.7 in the first year of telemedicine and then to 10.0 in the second year (P < 0.05). In Year 2 of the study, subjects also had a significantly higher number of goals in four of the five categories: education, family, health and social skills (P < 0.05). Although other changes at the youth detention facilities or in the juvenile justice system may have been partly responsible for the effects observed, the study suggests that telemedicine may be useful for improving the rate of attainment of goals associated with family relations and personality/behaviour. eid: 2-s2.0-64549154932
18. **Cost savings of telemedicine utilization for child psychiatry in a rural Kansas community**
The costs of pediatric telemedicine services remain underreported and understudied; however, there is evidence that telepediatric services can be cost competitive with traditional ones. For 15 years, the University of Kansas Center for Telemedicine and Telehealth has been providing telemental health outreach from the University of Kansas Medical Center (KUMC). One service site is located in Crawford County, Kansas, which provides telepsychiatry services to **child**ren and **adolesc**ents. The purpose of this study was to examine the costs of operating the Crawford County site relative to accessing services at KUMC, the likely alternative service location. The cost of travel time to parents who accompanied a dependent to either location also was estimated. Patients and parents were examined over a 6-month period in 2006. One hundred thirty-two patients received 257 telemedicine psychiatric consultations during this period. Cost estimates for using the pediatric telemedicine service were assessed for all patients; however, travel and related costs were collected from a sample of 26 patient-parent dyads. The estimated costs of services were obtained using standard cost-accounting procedures. An average cost per consultation in Crawford County was $168.61. The cost savings in travel time and other expenses to parents and patients were substantial between use of the county site and KUMC. Subtracting average savings in travel costs to patients and parents produced an average cost of a telepsychiatry consult in Crawford County of only $30.99. This study was conducted over 6 months with a small number of observations; it should be replicated over a longer study period, with more patients, and with more data that might capture marginal costs of services.

19. **A child and adolescent psychiatric outreach service for rural New South Wales: A telemedicine pilot study**
Objective: To examine the feasibility of a tertiary outreach service in **child** and **adolesc**ent psychiatry to two rural health centres in New South Wales, Australia. Methods: Following a site visit to Dubbo Hospital and Bourke Hospital, telemedical videoconferencing was provided for 2 h/week for 32 weeks. Details of referrers, patients' diagnosis and outcome, and **satisfact**ion with the service were obtained. Results: Cases were triaged by a nominated ru**ral ado**lescent mental health worker. The service provided detailed assessment and management of severe, complex, mental and neuropsychiatric disorders. Fifty-four young people were assessed and 72 joint consultative videoconferencing interviews were undertaken, including 26 initial consultations. Twenty-three initial consultations were undertaken on the visit to the rural centres. Clinical descriptions illustrate the flexibility and sensitivity of the service. Conclusion: Telepsychiatry provides access to a flexible, effective tertiary service for those with special, complex needs, including the disadvantaged or isolated. It makes a valuable, economic contribution to supporting and educating rural health professionals, thereby enriching rural **mental health servic**es. eid: 2-s2.0-0032702251
20. **Evaluating satisfaction with a child and adolescent psychological telemedicine outreach service**
A **child** and **adolesc**ent telepsychiatry service in rural New South Wales was **evalu**ated. Part of **the e**valuation was to assess whether rural mental health workers and patients were satisfied with the videoconferencing services provided** by c**hild psychiatrists f**rom t**he Children's Hospital at Westmead. During a 12-month study, information was collected using questionnaires on a total of 136 new patients who had been interviewed via videoconferencing. **Satisfact**ion questionnaires were completed by 100 rural mental health workers, and 82 patients and their families/carers. Questionnaires ab**out satis**faction with the technology were compl**eted **by 136 **child psychiatri**sts, 101 rural mental health workers and 79 patients. Patients and their families/carers, as well as rural clinicians, expressed high **overall s**atisfaction with the telepsychiatry servi**ce. T**he evaluation suggested that videoconferencing is a good meth**od of** providing child **and ado**lescent psychiatry services to remote and rural communities. eid: 2-s2.0-0043263814
21. **Diffusion of efficacious interventions for children and adolescents with mental health problems**
Background: **Child** and **adolesc**ent mental health problems are prevalent and require adequate interventions. Despite several evidence-based interventions for these problems described in the literature, few studies addressed strategies to diffuse efficacious interventions **for c**hild mental disorders especially in developing countries. Methods: An extensive but not systematic review of the literature was performed aiming to identify evidence-based interventi**ons f**or children **and ado**lescents with mental disorders, professionals to target in disseminating these interventions, and the available strategies to diffuse information. Results: Substantial evidence-based information is available to guide preventive, psychosocial and psychopharmacological interventions. The effectiveness of treatments in real-world settings and the cost-effectiveness of interventions are rarely tested. Professionals at different levels (teachers, school counselors, social workers, general practitioners, ped**iatri**cians, child psychologists and psychiatrists) should be targeted in diffusing efficacious in**terve**ntions for child mental health problems worldwide. Telepsychiatry and the internet seem to be the most promising strategies to diffuse knowledge with lower costs. Conclusions: Medical and allied professiona**ls mu**st incorporate ch**ild and** adolescent mental health issues in their under- and postgraduate curricula, and be better prepared to critically **evalu**ate available information. Professionals need to disseminate evidence-based programs to guide parents and teachers in developing** coun**tries to deal wit**h child** and adolescent difficulties. Countries need to explore internet solutions for dissemination of medical information.  2007 The Authors. eid: 2-s2.0-40449105030
22. **Child and adolescent telepsychiatry: Variations in utilization, referral patterns and practice trends**
Seattle **Child**ren's Hospital is a tertiary referral hospital that has provided telepsychiatry to seven partner sites in the north-west since 2001. Service utilization data, patient demographics and diagnoses were collected for the period from the service inception in October 2001 until November 2007. During the study period, 701 patients were treated with a mean of 2.8 appointments per patient (SD 1.9). Five psychiatrists and four psychologists provided care. Utilization varied across referring sites and was largely dependent upon the availability of telepsychiatrists, although the degree of support from administration and stakeholders also contributed to the success of the service. A total of 190 primary care practitioners referred patients to telepsychiatry, including 106 family physicians and 71 paediatricians. Paediatricians referred to the service more frequently than family physicians (t 1/4 2.8, P, 0.05). Overall, telepsychiatry with young people is feasible, acceptable and increases access to mental health care. There appear to be four core components necessary to a successful telepsychiatry programme: psychiatrists who are interested in exploring new ways to reach underserved young people; clearly identified stakeholders who can collaborate with one another to make good use of the telepsychiatry service**; a c**hildren's mental health 'champion' who represents these stakeholders and wants services for their community; and a stable administration that perceives telepsychiatry as valuable for their patients and their doctors. eid: 2-s2.0-77951001593
23. **Children's experiences with chat support and telephone support**
Background: In line with the wider trend of offering support via the Internet, many counseling and referral services for **child**ren have introduced online chat, often in addition to a traditional telephone service. Methods: A comparative study was conducted between the telephone service and the confidential one-on-one online chat service of the Dutch Kindertelefoon. The design included a concise pretest and a posttest (n = 902). The study also comprised a follow-up test (n = 213), which included the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Resul**ts: C**hildren experienced a higher sense of well-being and a reduced severity of their problems after consulting the Kindertelefoon. The results were slightly more favorable for the chat service than for the telephone service. The follow-up survey showed that many** of t**he children who contact the Kindertelefoon suffer from relatively severe emotional problems. Conclusions: Both the telephone and the web-based support i**mprov**ed the children's well-being and decreased their perceived burden of problem. The results of this study underline the need for closer coop**erati**on between child helplines an**d men**tal health and child welfare services**.  20**09 Association for Child and **Adolesc**ent Mental Health. eid: 2-s2.0-70349564761
24. **Experience with a rural telepsychiatry clinic for children and adolescents**
Access to **child** and **adolesc**ent psychiatric services in many rural areas is limited by lack of physicians and long travel times**. A c**hild **and ado**lescent telepsychiatry clinic that is part of the University of Kansas Medical Center's telemedicine program addresses this problem by linking the medical center with a county mental health center in rural Pittsburg, Kansas. The clinic receives ten to 18 visits a week and has been able to serve severely di**sturb**ed c**hildr**en and children in crisis. The quality of clinical interactions in the telepsychiatry clinic appears comparable to that in face- to-face meetings. eid: 2-s2.0-0032907876
25. **A retrospective analysis of a child and adolescent eMental health program**
OBJECTIVE: New models of psychiatric intervention are needed to improve the accessibility of mental health care in the primary care setting, particularly in rural areas of the United States and especially for **child**ren and **adolesc**ents. The aim of this study was to examine the diagnostic characteristics and outcomes **for c**hildren referred for eMental Health consultations at UC Davis (videoconferencing, telephone, and secure e-mail) from 10 primary care clinics in rural northern California. METHOD: A retrospective analysis was conducted on the diagnostic and clinical outcomes of 139 r**eferr**ed children who received a full psychiatric diagnostic **evalu**ation via videoconferencing. Within the group, a convenience sample of 58 initial and 41 three-mont**h fol**low-up Child Behavior Checklists (CBCLs) was collected. RESULTS: Comprehensive eMental Health programs appear to be effective for psychiatric diagnosis an**d ass**essment of children. Attention deficit (36.2%) and mood (28.1%) disorders were the most common diagnostic grou**pings** overall. Most children were seen only once, but a statistically significant improvement between init**ial e**valuation and 3-month follow-up in the convenience sample was seen in the Affect and Oppositional domains of the CBCL for girls and boys, respectively.

26. **Cost evaluation of a telepsychiatry service in northern Queensland**
We conducted a simple comparison of the costs associated with delivering a **mental health servic**e by telepsychiatry and by conventional methods. The telepsychiatry rural outreach service was delivered to a mining town 900 km from the regional hospital in Townsville. When the telemedicine service was well established, 40 cases a month were seen for general adult psychiatry, four for **child** and **adolesc**ent mental health, four for psychology and two for forensic services. Costs and quality-of-life issues were considered. The savings to the health authority were estimated to be $85,380 in the first year and $112,790 in subsequent years, not allowing for maintenance and equipment upgrading. We also estimated a 40% reduction in patient transfers due to the introduction of telemedicine. Based on the previous year's figures of 27 transfers at $8920 each, this would produce an annual saving of $96,336 for the Royal Flying Doctor Service. The results of the study showed considerable savings from reduced travel by patients and health-care workers. eid: 2-s2.0-0031614471
27. **Practice parameter for telepsychiatry with children and adolescents**
This practice parameter discusses the use of telepsychiatry to provide services to **child**ren and **adolesc**ents. The parameter defines terms and reviews the status of telepsychiatry as a mode of health service delivery. Because many of the issues addressed are unique to telepsychiatry, the parameter presents principles for establishing a telepsychiatry service and optimizing clinical practice within that service. The principles presented are based on existing scientific evidence and clinical consensus. Telepsychiatry is still evolving, and this parameter represents a first approach to determining "best practices." The parameter emphasizes the integration of telepsychiatry within other practice parameters of the American Academy** of C**hild **and Ado**lescent Psychiatry. 2008 by the American Aca**demy **of Ch**ild and** Adolescent Psychiatry. eid: 2-s2.0-57749176647

0. **Predicting post treatment client satisfaction between behavioural activation for depression delivered either in-person or via home-based telehealth**
Introduction: Treatment engagement, adherence, cancellations and other patient-centric data are important predictors of treatment **outcom**e. But often these data are only examined retrospectively. In this investigation, we analysed data from a clinical trial focused on innovative delivery of **depress**ion treatment to identify which patients are likely to prefer either in-home or in-person treatment based on pre-treatment characteristics. Methods: Patient **satisfact**ion was assessed in a trial of individuals w**ith dep**ression treated using identical behavioural activation therapy protocols in person or through videoconferencing to the home (N = 87 at post treatment: 42 in-person and 45 in-home participants). The Cli**ent Satis**faction Questionnaire was administered at the end of the treatment. A Tobit regression model was used to assess moderation using treatment assignment. Regression lines were generated to model tr**eatment s**atisfaction as a function of treatment assignment and to identify whether and where the groups intersected. We examined the distributions of the contributing moderators to the subsets of participants above and below the intersection point to identify differences. Results: While no significant differences** in patie**nt satisfaction were observed between the two groups, or between patients receiving treatment by different providers, baseline characteristics of the sample could be used to differentiate those with a preference for traditional, in-office care from those preferring in-home care. Discussion: Participants who were more likely to prefer in-home care were characterized by larger proportions of veterans and lower-ranked enlisted service members. They also had more severe symptoms at baseline and less formal education. Understanding client reactions when selecting treatment modality may allow for a more satisfying patient experience.

1. **Exploring the relationship between the acceptability of an internet-based intervention for depression in primary care and clinical outcomes: Secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial**
Background: **Depress**ion is one of the most prevalent psychological disorders worldwide. Although psychotherapy **for dep**ression is effective, there are barriers to its implementation in primary care in Spain. The use of the Internet has been shown to be a feasible solution. However, the acceptability of Internet-based interventions has not been studied sufficiently. Objective: To assess the acceptability of an Internet-based intervention (I**BI) for** depression in primary care, and explore the relationship between expectations and **satisfact**ion and the improvement in the clinical variables in primary care patients receiving this intervention. Furthermore, it offers data about the effects of some sociodemographic characteristics on these acceptability variables and analyzes whether the expectations are related to finalizing the intervention. Methods: Data we**re base**d on depressive patients who were participants in a randomized controlled trial. In the present study, we present the data from all the participants in the Internet intervention groups (N = 198). All the participants filled out the expectation **and satis**faction scales (six-item scales regarding treatment** logic, s**atisfaction, recommending, usefulness for other disorders, usefulness for the patient, and unpleasant**ness), **the Beck Depression Inventory-II, and the secondar**y outco**me measures: depression and anxiety impairment, and positive and negative affect. Results: Results showed that participants' expec**tations a**nd satisfaction with the program were both high and differences in e**xpectatio**ns and satisfaction depended on some sociodemographic variables (age: older people have higher expectations; sex:** women ha**ve greater satisfaction). A positive relationship between these variables and intervention efficacy was found: expectations related to usefulness for the patient were a statistically related predictor to the results on the BDI-II (Beta = 0.364), and the perception of how logical the treatment is (Beta = 0.528) was associated with change in the clinical variable. Furthermore, the higher the expectations, the higher the improvements exhibited by the patients in all measures evaluated during the ten intervention modules. High expectations were also directly related to finalizing the intervention. Conclusions: This is the first study in Spain to address this issue i**n the f**ield of IBIs for depression in primary care. The IBI showed high acceptance related to the intervention's efficacy and completion. Research on IBI acceptability could help to implement the treatment offered.

2. **Pregnancy and the Acceptability of Computer-Based Versus Traditional Mental Health Treatments**
Background: Recent recommendations urge increased **depress**ion screening in pregnant and postpartum women, potentially increasing demand for treatment. Computer-based psychotherapy treatments may address some of perinatal women's unique mental health treatment needs and barriers. Materials and Methods: We conducted a quantitative survey of pregnant women (12 weeks of gestation) on preferences regarding computer-based therapies compared with traditional therapies (psychotherapy and medication). Nonpregnant women and men served as comparison groups. Participants were provided descriptions of three computer-based therapies: Video telehealth therapy (VTT), computer-assisted therapy (CAT), and self-guided online therapy (SGO). Participants were asked to select all options that they would consider for treatment as well as first choice preference. The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) assessed curr**ent dep**ressive symptomatology, and the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) assessed psychiatric history. Results: Participants included pregnant females (n = 111), nonpregnant females (n = 147), and males (n = 54). Among pregnant women, 77.5% (n = 86) indicated that they would consider some form of computer-based therapy for mental health treatment during pregnancy; VTT was the most commonly considered, followed by CAT and SGO. When asked to select their preferred intervention, traditional talk therapy was the first choice among all three groups, controlling for treatment history and PHQ-9 score. About one-third of pregnant women chose some form of computer-based therapy as their top choice. Conclusions: While computer-based therapies were acceptable to most pregnant women in this sample, traditional talk therapy was the preferred option. Future research should consider how to tailor computer-based therapies to the unique needs of perinatal women.  2017, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-85031664085
3. **A positive psychology intervention for patients with bipolar depression: a randomized pilot trial**
Background: There are few effective treatments for bipolar **depress**ion, a common and debilitating illness. Aims: We aimed to examine the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a four-week, telephone-delivered positive psychology (PP) intervention for patients with bipo**lar dep**ression. Methods: Twenty-five patients hospitalized for **bipolar** depression were randomized to receive a PP (n = 14) or control condition (CC; n = 11) intervention. Following discharge, participants completed weekly exercises and phone calls with a study trainer. PP intervention feasibility was assessed by the number of exercises completed, and acceptability was examined on five-point Likert-type scales of ease and utility. Between-group differences on psychological constructs at 4 and 8weeks post-enrollment were assessed using mixed effects regression models. Results: Participants in the PP group completed an average of three out of four PP exercises and found PP exercises to be subjectively helpful, though neither easy nor difficult. Compared to CC, the PP intervention led to trends towards greater improvements in positive affect and optimism at follow-up, with large effect sizes (modified Cohens d = 0.951.24). PP had variable, non-significant effects on negative psychological constructs. Conclusions: Larger, randomized trials are needed to further evaluate the efficacy of this intervention in this high-risk population.  2018,  2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group. eid: 2-s2.0-85048582203
4. **Common Factors and Depressive Symptom Relief Trajectories in Group Teletherapy for Persons Ageing with HIV**
Telepsychology research has focused primarily on treatment efficacy, with far less attention devoted to how common factors relate to teletherapy **outcom**es. This research identified trajectories of **depress**ive symptom relief in 105 older people living with HIV with eleva**ted dep**ressive symptoms enrolled in a randomized clinical trial testing two 12-session group teletherapies and compared common factors (e.g., therapeutic alliance and group cohesion)** across** depressive symptom trajectory groups. Growth mixture modellin**g of we**ekly depression scores i**dentifi**ed three depressive symptom change groups: (1) early improvers (31%) who rep**orted r**eductions in depressive symptoms by Session 4; (2) delayed improvers (16%) whose symptoms improved after Session 5 and (3) non-improvers (53%). Therapeutic alliance was unrelated to treatm**ent ou**tcome group. Group cohesion was greater in early improvers than non-improvers. Group cohesion was unexpectedly lower, and group member similarity was greater in delayed improvers than non-improvers. Early improvers had been living with HIV/AIDS for fewer years than non-improvers. In group teletherapy, group cohesion and group member similarity are more important than clienttherapist alliance. Copyright  2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Key Practitioner Message: In group teletherapy with older people living with HIV (OPLWHIV), three** laten**t outcome trajectory groups emerged over the 12-week treatment period: (1) non-improvers (53%); (2) early improvers (31%) and (3) delayed improvers (16%). In group teletherapy with OPLWHIV, group cohesion is **a stron**ger predictor of depressive symptom relief than is clienttherapist alliance. OPLWHIV in group teletherapy who do not respond to treatment until the latter therapy se**ssions **can still experience depressive symptom relief comparable with early responders.

5. **Predictors of persistence of comorbid generalized anxiety disorder among veterans with major depressive disorder**
Objective: A limited number of randomized clinical trials show that efficacious pharmacologic treatments exist for comorbid **major** **depress**ive disorder (MDD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). The aims of this effectiveness study were to describe the impact o**f a dep**ression care management intervention on the persistence of comorbid GAD symptoms in a sample of primary care patients with MDD and to identify risk factors for persistent GAD. Method: Data were collected from April 2003 to September 2005 for the Telemedicine-Enhan**ced Ant**idepressant Management (TEAM) study, a multisite, randomized effectiveness trial targeting US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) primary care pa**tients **with depression. Veterans aged 26.59-88.36 years received either the TEAM intervention or usual care in small VA community-based outpatient clinics. The TEAM care management intervention focused on** optimi**zing antidepressant therapy through patient education and activation, symptom monitoring, adherence promotion, and side-effect management. Veterans who screened positive for MDD using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (based on DSM-IV criteria) and who met the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview criteria (maintaining consistency with DSM-IV-TR) for comorbid GAD at baseline were selected for the present study (N = 168). The primary **outcom**e was persistence of GAD at 6 months and 12 months. All predictors available in the TEAM study data that were described in the literature to be associated with influencing **GAD ou**tcomes were examined. Resu**lts: Pe**rsistence of depression was the strongest predictor of persistence of comorbid GAD at both 6 months (OR = 5.75; 95% CI, 2.38-13.86; P < .05) and 12 months (OR = 15.56; 95% CI, 6.10-39.68; P < .05). Although the TEAM interventio**n signi**ficantly reduced depression symptom severity, it was not significantly associated with GAD persistence. Insomnia was a significant protective factor for persistence of GAD at 6 months (OR = 0.66; 95% CI, 0.44-0.99; P < .05). Conclusions: Early screening for presence of comorbid GAD among those with MDD may be valuable both for further research and for enhancing clinical management of GAD and MDD comorbidity.

6. **Counselling versus low-intensity cognitive behavioural therapy for persistent sub-threshold and mild depression (CLICD): A pilot/feasibility randomised controlled trial**
Background: Persistent **depress**ive symptoms below the threshold criteria for ma**jor dep**ression represent a chronic condition with high risk of progression to a diagnosis o**f **major**** depression. The evidence base for psychological treatments such as Person-Centred Counselling and Low-Intensity Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for su**b-thres**hold depressive sy**mptoms **and mild depression is limited, particularly for longer-term **outcom**es. Methods: This study aimed to test the feasibility of delivering a randomised controlled trial into the clinical and cost effectiveness of Low-Intensity Cognitive Behavioural Therapy versus Person-Centred Counselling for patients with persi**stent s**ub-threshold depre**ssive s**ymptoms and mild depression. The prim**ary ou**tcome measures for this pilot/feasibility trial were recruitment, adherence and retention rates at six months from baseline. An important se**condar**y outcome measure was recov**ery fro**m, or prevention of, depression at six months assessed via a structured clinical interview by an independent assessor blind to the participant's treatment condition. Thirty-six patients were recruited in five general practices and were randomised to either eight weekly sessions of person-centred counselling each lasting up to an hour, or up to eight weeks of cognitive-behavioural self-help resources with guided telephone support sessions lasting 20-30 minutes each. Results: Recruitment rate in relation to the number of patients approached at the general practices was 1.8 %. Patients attended an average of 5.5 sessions in both interventions. Retention rate for the 6-month follow-up assessments was 72.2 %. Of participants assessed at six months, 71.4 % of partic**ipants **with a diagnosis of mild depression at baseline had recovered, while 66.7 % with a d**iagnosi**s of persistent subthreshold depress**ion at **baseline had not develope**d **m**ajor depress**ion. There were no significant differences between treatment** groups** for both recovery and prevention of depression at six months or on** any o**f the outcome measures. Conclusions: It is feasible to recruit participants and successfully deliver both interventions in a primary care** settin**g to patients with subthreshold and mild depression; however recruiting requires significant input at the general practices. The evidence from this study suggests that short-term Person-Centred Counselling and Low-Intensity Cognitive Behaviour Therapy are potentially effective and their effectiveness should be evaluated in a larger randomised controlled study which includes a health economic evaluation.

7. **Occupational impact of internet-delivered cognitive behaviour therapy for depression and anxiety: Reanalysis of data from five Australian randomised controlled trials**
Objective: To determine whether internet-delivered cognitive behaviour therapy (iCBT) for **depress**ion and anxiety reduces self-reported absenteeism in employed individuals.Design, participants and setting: We reanalysed data from five randomised controlled trials of iCBT: two **for dep**ression (conducted from September 2008 to February 2009 and from June 2009 to January 2010), two for generalised anxiety disorder (conducted from March 2009 to June 2009 and from July 2009 to January 2010) and one for social phobia (conducted from May 2008 to July 2008). Participants across Australia were recruited via a website. The inclusion criteria were: (i) meets criteria for the disorder of interest; (ii) aged 18 years or over; (iii) no previous history of a psychotic disorder or drug or alcohol misuse; (iv) not actively suicidal. The iCBT courses each consisted of six online lessons (to be completed within 11 weeks), homework assignments, automatic emails and resource documents.Main **outcom**e measure: The number of days absent (self-reported absenteeism) in the previous week.Results: We included 284 participants in our analysis. When data for the three disorders were combined, participants who received iCBT had significant reductions in self-reported absenteeism compared with those in the control groups (who were on a waitlist) (P = 0.03). When data for the three disorders were analysed separately, reductions in self-reported absenteeism for participants who received iCBT were not significantly different to those for participants in the control groups.Conclusion: Using data from five RCTs, we showed that iCBT was associated with reductions in self-reported absenteeism. Future research should focus on replicating these findings in other contexts, such as other disorders and other iCBT courses.  2014, Australasian Medical Publishing Co. Ltd.

8. **Telephone-administered psychotherapy in combination with antidepressant medication for the acute treatment of major depressive disorder**
Background Telephone-administered psychotherapies (T-P) provided as an adjunct to anti**depress**ant medication may improve response rates in ma**jor dep**ressive disorder (MDD). The goal of this study was to compare telephone-administered social rhythm therapy (T-SRT) and telephone-administered intensive clinical management (T-ICM) as adjuncts** to ant**idepressant medication for MDD. A secondary goal was to compare T-P with Treatment as Usual (TAU) as adjunctive treatment to medication for MDD. Methods 221 adult out-patients with MDD**, curre**ntly depressed, were randomly assigned to 8 sessions of weekly T-SRT (n=110) or T-ICM (n=111), administered as an adjunct to agomelatine. Both psychotherapies were administered entirely by telephone, by trained psychologists who were blind to other aspects of treatment. The 221 patients were a posteriori m**atched **with 221 depressed outpatients receiving TAU (controls). The primary **outcom**e measure was the percentage of responders at 8 weeks post-treatment. Results No significant differences were found between T-SRT and T-ICM. But T-P was associated with higher response rates (65.4% vs 54.8%, p=0.02) and a trend toward higher remission rates (33.2% vs 25.1%; p=0.06) compared to TAU. Limitations Short term study. Conclusions This study is the first assessing the short-term effects of an add-on, brief, telephone-administer**ed psyc**hotherapy in depressed pa**tients **treated with antidepressant medication. Eight sessions of weekly telephone-delivered psychot**herapy **as an adjunct to antidepressant medication resulted in improved response rates relative to medication alone. eid: 2-s2.0-84944809872
9. **Trajectory of cost overtime after psychotherapy for depression in older Veterans via telemedicine**
Background Little evidence exists regarding the costs of telemedicine, especially considering changes over time. This analysis aimed to analyze trajectory of healthcare cost before, during, and after a behavioral activation intervention delivered via telepsychology and same-room delivery to elderly Veterans with **depress**ion. Methods 241 participants were randomly assigned into one of two study groups: behavioral activation **for dep**ression via telemedicine or via same-room treatment. Patients received 8 weeks of weekly 60-min individual sessions of behavioral activat**ion for** depression. Primary **outcom**es were collected at 12-months. Inpatient, outpatient, pharmacy, and total costs were collected from VA Health Economics Resource Center (HERC) datasets for FY 19982014 and compared between the two treatment groups. Generalized mixed models were used to investigate the trajectories over time. Results Overall cost, as well as, outpatient and pharmacy cost show increasing trend over time. Unadjusted and adjusted trajectories over time for any cost were not different between the two treatment groups. There was a significant overall increasing trend over time for outpatient (p<0.001) and total cost (p<0.001) but not for inpatient (p=0.543) or pharmacy cost (p=0.084). Limitations Generalizability to younger, healthier populations may be limited due to inclusion criteria for study participants. Conclusion Healthcare costs before, during, and after intervention did not differ between the telemedicine and in-person delivery methods. Outpatient costs accounted for most of the increasing trend of cost over time. These results support policies to use both telehealth and in-person treatment modalities to effectively and efficiently provide high quality care.  2016 Elsevier B.V. eid: 2-s2.0-85007545283
10. **Telephone-based care management for older adults initiated on psychotropic medication**
Objective This study aimed to explore the longitudinal, 6-month symptom course of older adults newly started on an anti**depress**ant or anxiolytic by non-psychiatrist physicians and enrolled in a care management program. Method This is a naturalistic cohort study of older adults (age 65 years) receiving pharmacotherapy and telephone-based care management. Participants are non-institutionalized adults participating in Pennsylvania's Pharmaceutical Assistance Contract for the Elderly who completed telephone-based clinical assessments including demographic data, self-report on history of psychiatric treatment and adherence, and standardized symptom scales. Results A total of 162 participants with an average age of 77.2 years (SD 6.8) were followed and, for analysis, split into two groups by PHQ-9 score: 75 (46.3%) scoring 0-4 (minimally symptomatic group, MSG) and 87 (53.7%) scoring 5 (symptomatic group, SG). Over 6 months, the SG improved with PHQ-9 scores beginning on average at 10.0 (SD 4.6) and falling to 5.4 (SD 4.2) (F(1, 86) = 29.53, p &lt; 0.0001). The MSG had no significant change** in dep**ressive symptoms. Emotional health as measured by SF-12 Mental Composite Score mirrored the PHQ-9 change and lack thereof in the SG and MSG, respectively. No clinical or demographic features were associated with symptom improvement in the SG although they were more likely to report medication adherence (66.7% vs. 44.0%, 2(1) = 8.4, p = 0.0037) compared with the MSG. Conclusions Participation of symptomatic older adults initiated on psychotropic medication in a telephone-based care management program was associated with improve**ment in** depressive symptoms and overall emotional well-being, notable findings given participants' advanced age, state-wide distribution, and history of limited utilization of mental health care.  2012 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. eid: 2-s2.0-84874702662
11. **The second randomised evaluation of the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and acceptability of computerised therapy (REEACT-2) trial: Does the provision of telephone support enhance the effectiveness of computer-delivered cognitive behaviour therapy? a randomised controlled trial**
Background: Computerised cognitive behaviour therapy (cCBT) is an efficient form of therapy potentially improving access to psychological care. Indirect evidence suggests that the uptake and effectiveness of cCBT can be increased if facilitated by telephone, but this is not routinely offered in the NHS. Objectives: To compare the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of telephone-facilitated free-to-use cCBT [e.g. MoodGYM (National Institute for Mental Health Research, Australian National University, Canberra, ACT, Australia)] with minimally supported cCBT. Design: This study was a multisite, pragmatic, open, two-arm, parallel-group randomised controlled trial with a concurrent economic evaluation. Setting: Participants were recruited from GP practices in Bristol, Manchester, Sheffield, Hull and the north-east of England. Participants: Potential participants were eligible to participate in the trial if they were adults with **depress**ion scoring  10 on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Interventions: Participants were randomised using a computer-generated random number sequence to receive minimally supported cCBT or telephone-facilitated cCBT. Participants continued with usual general practitioner care. Main **outcom**e measures: The prim**ary ou**tcome was self-reported symptoms** of dep**ression, as assessed by the PHQ-9 at 4 months post randomisation. Se**condar**y outcomes**: Seco**ndary outcom**es were** depression at 12 months and anxiety, somatoform complaints, health utility (as assessed by the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions questionnaire) and resource use at 4 and 12 months. Results: Clinical effectiveness: 182 participants were randomised to minimally supported cCBT and 187 participants to telephone-facilitated cCBT. There was a difference in the **severit**y of depression at 4 and 12 months, with lower levels in the telephone-facilitated group. The odds of **no long**er being depressed (defined as a PHQ-9 score of < 10) at 4 months were twice as high in the telephone-facilitated cCBT group [odds ratio (OR) 2.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.23 to 3.42]. The benefit of telephone-facilitated cCBT was no longer significant at 12 months (OR 1.63, 95% CI 0.98 to 2.71). At 4 months the between-group difference in PHQ-9 scores was 1.9 (95% CI 0.5 to 3.3). At 12 months the results still favoured telephone-facilitated cCBT but were no longer statistically significant, with a difference in PHQ-9 score of 0.9 (95% CI-0.5 to 2.3). When considering the whole follow-up period, telephone-facilitated cCBT was asssociated with significantly lower PHQ-9 scores than minimally supported cCBT (mean difference-1.41, 95% CI-2.63 to-0.17; p = 0.025). There was a significant improvement in anxiety scores over the trial period (between-group difference 1.1, 95% CI 0.1 to 2.3; p = 0.037). In the case of somatic complaints (assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-15), there was a borderline statistically significant difference over the trial period (between-group difference 1.1, 95% CI 0.0 to 1.8; p = 0.051). There were gains in quality-adjusted life-years at reduced cost when telephone facilitation was added to MoodGYM. However, the results were subject to uncertainty. Conclusions: The results showed short-term benefits from the addition of telephone facilitation to cCBT. The effect was small to moderate and comparable with that of other primary care psychological interventions. Telephone facilitation should be considered whe**n offer**ing cCBT for depression.

12. **Cost-effectiveness of a novel e-health depression service**
Objectives: A recent trial assessed feasibility of an e-health service ("Improvehealth.eu") to support **depress**ion care and reported positive **outcom**es. Our objective was to examine cost-effectiveness of the Improvehealth.eu service. A baseline model was used to evaluate cost and effects of the intervention. Given the high uncertainty in the input space, a series of alternative scenarios were evaluated to challenge the result. The aim was to find if conservative or even pessimistic estimates and assumptions could result in a change of the cost-effectiveness from the baseline model. Materials and Methods: A probabilis**tic dep**ression model combined with bootstrapping was built and populated with data from the literature and from the pilot efficacy trial of the e-health service. The core of the model was a stochastic mapping function that tra**nslated** depression-speci**fic ou**tcomes to quality-adjusted life years. Correlated sampling was used to obtain unbiased and consistent piecewise linear transformat**ion of **Beck Depression Inventory scores to utilities. The results are shown as cost-effectiveness acceptability curves with value of information data. An extreme scenario analysis was then performed to deal with parameter, structural, and modeling uncertainty. Results: Cost-effectiveness of the e-health service was favorable because of low cost and high efficacy of the intervention. Apart from the most pessimistic one, none of the 13 alternative scenarios changed the preferred alternative. Conclusions: Improvehealth.eu is cost-effective relative to usual care, given the available efficacy data. Results of the health economic evaluation were robust to alternative assumptions, despite considerable uncertainty in input data.  Copyright 2013, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2013. eid: 2-s2.0-84891643082
13. **The effectiveness of Telepsychiatry-Based culturally sensitive collaborative treatment for depressed Chinese American immigrants: A randomized controlled trial**
Objective: This study evaluates the effectiveness of a telepsychiatry-based culturally sensitive collaborative treatment (T-CSCT) intervention to improve treatment **outcom**es for **depress**ed Chinese American immigrants. Methods: Participants were Chinese Americans recruited from primary care settings from February 1, 2009, to July 31, 2012, with DSM-IV ma**jor dep**ressive disorder (MDD) identified by the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview. Eligible patients were randomized to receive either T-CSCT or treatment as usual (TAU) for 6 months. T-CSCT involves (1) cultural consultation via videoconference and (2) care management. The prim**ary ou**tcome measure was the 17-item H**amilton** Depression Rating Scale (HDRS17); positive response was defined as a  50% decrease in HDRS17 score, and remission was defined as HDRS17 score  7. Se**condar**y outcome measures were the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness (CGI-S) and Improvement (CGI-I) scales and the Quality of Life Enjoyment and **Satisfact**ion Questionnaire** (Q-LE**S-Q). Outcomes were compared using multivariate logistic regression and mixedmodel for repeated measures methods. Results: Among participants (N = 190), 63% were female, and the mean (SD) age was 50 (14.5) years. They were randomized to T-CSCT (n = 97; 51%) or TAU (n = 93; 49%). Using multivariate logistic regression analyses, the odds of achieving response and remission were significantly greater for the T-CSCT group compared to the control group (odds ratio [OR] = 3.9 [95% CI, 1.9 to 7.8] and 4.4 [95% CI, 1.9 to 9.9], respectively). Multivariate general linear model analyses showed that patients in the T-CSCT group had significantly greater improvement over time in HDRS17 (F4,95 = 4.59, P = .002), CGI-S (F4,95 = 4.22, P = .003), and CGI-I (F4,95 = 2.95, P = .02) scores. Conclusions: T-CSCT is effective in impr**oving ****treatment outcom**es of Chinese immigrants with MDD.  2016 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-84989325589
14. **Psychotherapy for depression in older veterans via telemedicine: Effect on quality of life, satisfaction, treatment credibility, and service delivery perception**
Objective: To analyze the impact of telepsychology and sameroom care on functioning, **satisfact**ion, and perception of care based on a noninferiority trial of psychotherapy delivered via telemedicine or same-room care to elderly patients with **depress**ion. Methods: 241 elderly patients w**ith dep**ression (meeting DSM-IV diagnostic criteria) were randomly assigned to either telemedicine (n = 120) or same-room treatment (n = 121) between April 1, 2007, and July 31, 2011. The primary **outcom**es included quality of life (36-item Short Form Survey [SF-36**]), satis**faction (Charleston Psychiatric Out**patient S**atisfaction Scale), treatment credibility, and service delivery perception scores obtained at 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 3 months, and 12 months. Comparisons of intervention means were carried out at each time point using independent sample t tests and SAS Procedure MIANALYZE to combine results across the multiply imputed complete data sets. If significant differences were detected for a gi**ven ou**tcome within a domain, a Bonferroni correction was applied to determine if significance was maintained. Results: None of the SF-36 scores showed a significant difference between the 2 treatment groups by the end of the study period, with little significance shown throughout the intermediate time points. Similarly, over all time points, there was no statistically significant difference** in patie**nt satisfaction or treatment credibility. Conclusions: This study found that telemedicine is a viable alternative modality for providing evidence-based psychotherapy for elderly patien**ts with** depression. Results provide evidence that qual**ity of li**fe and satisfaction with care are not adversely influenced by the decision to use a telehealth modality instead of in-person treatment, and, as a result, resources can be devoted to offering services in patients' homes through telemedicine.

15. **Acceptance of home-based telehealth problem-solving therapy for depressed, low-income homebound older adults: Qualitative interviews with the participants and aging-service case managers**
Purpose: To report low-income homebound older adults' experience of telehealth problem-solving therapy (tele-PST) and aging-service case managers' (CMs') experience/perception of client-level personal barriers to accessing psychotherapy in general and PST specifically. Design and Methods: The study sample consisted of 42 homebound older adults who participated in the feasibility and efficacy trial of tele-PST and completed 36-week follow-up assessments and 12 CMs of a large home-delivered meals program who referred their clients to the tele-PST trial. In-depth interviews with the older adults and written feedback and focus group discussions with the CMs provided the data. Results: Older adults reported a high rate of approval of PST procedures and acknowledged its positive treatment effect. Tele-PST participants were satisfied with videoconferenced sessions because they were convenient and allowed them to see their therapist. However, CMs reported that only about 10%-20% of potentially eligible older adults gave oral consent for PST. Significant treatment engagement barriers were the older adults' lack of motivation, denial of **depress**ion, perceived stigma, and other personal attitudinal factors. Implications: The real-world implementation of tele-PST or other psychotherapies needs to include educating and motivat**ing dep**ressed homebound elders to recogniz**e their** depression and accept treatment.  2013 The Author. eid: 2-s2.0-84905013447
16. **Telepsychiatry evaluation in the north-west of England: Preliminary results of a qualitative study**
A telepsychiatry referral service for patients suffering from anxiety and **depress**ion was evaluated from a user perspective. Low-cost video-phones linked a psychiatrist to two general practices in the north-west of England. Quantitative data were collected using a semistructured interview schedule. Twenty-two patients and 13 doctors were interviewed after a video-link consultation. Some users were very positive about the service and recognized its potential benefits, while others were more ambivalent. Patients saw the service as a means of obtaining additional 'expert' advice. General practitioners felt that the service might adversely affect the doctor-patient relationship in psychiatry. Both patients and clinicians recognized that the video-link modified normal interaction. Users need to adapt to this form of communication. An induction session is recommended for both patients and clinicians. eid: 2-s2.0-0002345539
17. **A study of the effectiveness of telepsychiatry-based culturally sensitive collaborative treatment of depressed Chinese Americans**
Background: Chinese American patients with **Major** **Depress**ive Disorder (MDD) tend to underutilize mental health services and are more likely to seek help in primary care settings than from mental health specialists. Our team has reported that Culturally Sensitive Collaborative Treatment (CSCT) is effective in improving recognition and treatment engagement** of dep**ressed Chinese Americans in primary care. The current study builds on this prior research by incorporating telemedicine technology into the CSCT model.Methods/Design: We propose a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the acceptability and effectiveness of a telepsychiatry-based culturally sensitive collaborative treatment (T-CSCT) intervention targeted toward Chinese Americans. Patients meeting the study's eligibility criteria will receive either treatment as usual or the intervention under investigation. The six-month intervention involves: 1) an initial psychiatric interview using a culturally sensitive protocol via videoconference; 2) eight scheduled phone visits with a care manager assigned to the patient, who will monitor the patient's progress, as well as medication side effects and dosage if applicable; and 3) collaboration between the patient's PCP, psychiatrist, and care manager. **Outcom**e measures **include** depressive symptom severity as well as patient and PCP **satisfact**ion with the telepsychiatry-based care management service.Discussion: The study investigates the T-CSCT model, which we believe will increase the feasibility and practicality of the CSCT model by adopting telemedicine technology. We anticipate that this model will expand access to culturally competent psychiatrists fluent in patients' native languages to improve t**reatmen**t of depressed minority patients in primary care settings.Trial Registration: NCT00854542.  2011 Yeung et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd. eid: 2-s2.0-80053372067
18. **Pilot randomised controlled trial of Help4Mood, an embodied virtual agent-based system to support treatment of depression**
Introduction: Help4Mood is an interactive system with an embodied virtual agent (avatar) to assist in self-monitoring of patients receiving treatment for **depress**ion. Help4Mood supports self-report and biometric monitoring and includes elements of cognitive behavioural therapy. We aimed to evaluate system use and acceptability, to explore likely recruitment and retention rates in a clinical trial and to obtain an estimate of potential treatment response with a view to conducting a future randomised controlled trial (RCT). Methods: We conducted a pilot RCT of Help4Mood in three centres, in Romania, Spain and Scotland, UK. Patients with diagno**sed dep**ression** (**major**** depressive disorder) and current mi**ld/mode**rate depressive symptoms were randomised to use the system for four weeks in addition to treatment as usual (TAU) or to TAU alone. Results: Twenty-seven individuals were randomised and follow-up data were obtained from 21 participants (12/13 Help4Mood, 9/14 TAU). Half of participants randomised to Help4Mood used it regularly (more than 10 times); none used it every day. Acceptability varied between users. Some valued the emotional responsiveness of the system, while others found it too repetitive. Intention to treat analysis showed a small difference in** change** of Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-2) scores (Help4Mood 5.7 points, TAU 4.2). Post-hoc on-treatment analysis suggested that participants who used Help4Mood regularly experienced a median change in BDI-2 of 8 points. Conclusion: Help4Mood is acceptable to some patients rece**iving t**reatment for depression although none used it as regularly **as inte**nded. Changes in depression symptoms in individuals who used the system regularly reached potentially meaningful levels.  2015,  The Author(s) 2015. eid: 2-s2.0-84983070104
19. **Comorbid Anxiety Disorders and Treatment of Depression in People With Multiple Sclerosis**
Objective: Anxiety is highly comorbid with **depress**ion, but little is known about the impact of anxiety disorders on the effectiveness of empirically supported psychotherapies **for dep**ression. We examined such **outcom**es for people with Multiple Sclerosis (**MS) and** depression, with versus without comorbid anxiety disorders. Design: Participants with MS (N = 102) received 16 weeks of telephone-administered psycho**therapy** for depression and were followed for one year post-treatment. Results: Participants with comorbid anxiety disorders improved to a similar degree during treatment as those without anxiety disorde**rs. Ou**tcomes during follow-up were mixed, and thus we divided the anxiety diagnoses into distress and fear disorders. The distress disorder (GAD) was associated with elevated anxiety symptoms during and after treatment. In contrast, fear disorders (i.e., panic disorder, agoraphobia, social phobia, specific phobia)** were l**inked to depression, specifically during follow-up, across 3 different measures. Conclusions: People with GAD rece**iving t**reatment for depression may benefit from additional services targeting anxiety more specifically, while those with comorbid fear disorders may benefit from services targeting maintenance of gains after treatment.  2010 American Psychological Association. eid: 2-s2.0-77956497074
20. **Feasibility and impact of telemonitor-based depression care management for geriatric homecare patients**
Objective: The objective of this study was to test the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary clinical **outcom**es of a method to leverage existing home healthcare telemonitoring technology to deliver **depress**ion care management (DCM) to both Spanish- and English-speaking elderly homebound recipients of homecare services. Materials and Methods: Three stand-alone, nonprofit community homecare agencies located in New York, Vermont, and Miami participated in this study. Evidence-based DCM was adapted to the telemonitor platform by programming questions and educational information** on dep**ression sympto**ms, ant**idepressant adherence, and side effects. Recruited patients participated for a minimum of 3 weeks. Telehealth nurses were trained on DCM and received biweekly supervision. On-site trained research assistants conducted in-home research in**terview**s on depression diagnosis and severity and patient **satisfact**ion with the protocol. Results: An ethnically diverse sample of 48 English- and Spanish-only-speaking patients participated, along with seven telehealth nurses. Both patients and telehealth nurses reported high levels of protocol acceptance. Among 19 patients meeting diagnostic cri**teria f**or **major** d**epressi**on, the mean depression severity was in the "markedly severe" range at baseline and in the "mild" range at follow-up. Conclusions: Results of this pilot support the feasibility of using homecare's existing telemonitoring technology to deliver DCM to their elderly homebound patients. This was true for both English- and Spanish-speaking patients. Preliminary clini**cal ou**tcomes** sugges**t improvement in depression severity, although these findings require testing in a randomized clinical trial. Implications for the science and **service** of telehealth-based depression care for elderly patients are discussed.  Copyright 2011, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2011. eid: 2-s2.0-80053250021
21. **Automated depression screening in disadvantaged pregnant women in an urban obstetric clinic**
Objective: A promising means of screening for **depress**ion among high-risk perinatal women involves interactive voice response (IVR) technology in which patients self-enter data into a database using a touch tone telephone. Our aim was to test the feasibility of using IVR to screen **for dep**ression among low-income, urban pregnant patients and to solicit their preferences for treatment. Methods: The study population included a convenience sample of English-speaking pregnant patients awaiting routine prenatal visits in an urban obstetric clinic. Consenting subjects used a phone in a private clinic room to complete an IVR version of the Edinburgh Po**stnatal** Depression Scale (EPDS). Patients scoring **in the **"not depressed" range were branched to a closing message while those with** mild t**o severe depressive symptoms were branched to additional automated questions about their treatment preferences. Results: All 54 participants who consented to the study were able to complete the IVR phone session. More than 90% expressed willingness to complete IVR interviews as part of routine prenatal and postpartum care. Sixteen out of 54 participants (29.6%) scored in the moderate **to seve**re range for depressive symptoms (EPDS  12) which was consistent with a prior study in the same population using a validated paper-pencil screen. **Only 12** out of 21 (57%) depressed subjects indicated a desire to speak with a health care provider about how they are fee**ling. T**he **major**ity of these depressed subjects preferred to speak with a social worker about housing or financial problems (92%) or an obstetrician or midwife (83%), while a minority (42%) wanted to speak with a mental health professional. Conclusions: This pilot study suggests that it is feasible to use an automate**d phone** interview to screen for depression in low-income, urban pregnant women.  2007 Springer-Verlag. eid: 2-s2.0-34547734529
22. **Evaluating an e-mental health program (deprexis) as adjunctive treatment tool in psychotherapy for depression: Results of a pragmatic randomized controlled trial**
Background **Depress**ive disorders place a significant disease burden on individuals as well as on societies. Several web-based interventions **for dep**ression have shown to be effective in r**educing** depressive symptoms. However, it is not known whether web-based interventions, when used as adjunctive treatment tools to regular psychotherapy, have an additional effect compared to regular psycho**therapy** for depression. Methods Adults (N = 98) with a unipolar affective disorder were recruited in routine outpatient psychotherapy practices in Germany from therapists over the course of their initial sessions and randomized within therapists to one of two active treatment conditions: regular psychotherapy or psychotherapy p**lus a w**eb-based depression program (deprexis). **Primary** **outcom**e was depressive symptoms** measur**ed with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) at 12 weeks. Second**ary ou**tcomes were anxiety symptoms, somatic symptoms and quality of life at 12 weeks and six months follow-up. The study also included an assessment of the working alliance after six and 12 weeks. Results The combination of psychotherapy with the web-based program was more effective than psychotherapy alone at 12 weeks, with medium between-gr**oup eff**ect sizes on primary depressive symptoms (Cohen's d =.51) and small to medium between-group effect sizes on se**condar**y outcomes (Cohen's d =.07.55). Furthermore, we did not observe negative side effects in the blended format, e.g., a lower working alliance than in psychotherapy alone. Limitations The study had a smaller than planned sample size and the dropout rate at follow-up was high. Conclusions This study provides first evidence that the use of a web-based program as an adjunctive tool in regular psychotherapy could be a promising option to c**onsider** in future treatment for depression.  2017 Elsevier B.V. eid: 2-s2.0-85034089945
23. **Use of standard webcam and internet equipment for telepsychiatry treatment of depression among underserved hispanics**
Objective: **Depress**ion affects nearly one in five Americans at some time in their life, causing individual suffering and financial cost. The Internet has made it possible to deliver telemedicine care economically to areas and populations with limited access to specialist or culturally and linguistically congruent care. Methods: This study compared the effectiveness for Hispanic patients** of dep**ression treatment provided by a psychiatrist through Internet videoconferencing (Webcam intervention) and treatment as usual by a primary care provider. Adults (N=167) with a diagn**osis of** depression were recruited from a community clinic and were randomly assigned to treatment condition. Webcam participants met remotely each month with the psychiatrist, and treatment-as-usual patients received customary care from their primary care providers, all for six months. At baseline and three and six months, analyses of variance tested differences between conditions i**n score**s on depression rating scales and quality-of-life and functional ability measures. Results: All participants experienced an** improv**ement in depression symptoms. Ratings on th**e Montg**omery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale by clinicians blind to treatment group and self-ratings on the nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire, Quality of Life Enjoyment and **Satisfact**ion Questionnaire, and Sheehan Disability Scale showed a significant main effect of time. On all four measures, a significant interaction of time by intervention favoring the Webcam group was noted. Discussion: Results suggest that telepsychiatry delivered through the Internet utilizing commercially available domestic Webcams and standard Internet and computer equipment is effective and acceptable. Use of this technology may help close the gap in access to culturally and linguistically congruent specialists. Copyright  American Psychiatric Association. eid: 2-s2.0-84878320324
24. **Design and implementation of the Telemedicine-Enhanced Antidepressant Management Study**
Objective: Evidence-based practices designed for large urban clinics are not necessarily transportable into small rural practices. Implementing collaborative care for **depress**ion in small rural primary care clinics presents unique challenges because it is typically not feasible to employ on-site mental health specialists. The purpose of the Telemedicine-Enhanced **Antidep**ressant Management (TEAM) study was to evaluate a collaborative care model adapted for small rural clinics using telemedicine technologies. The purpose of this paper is to describe the TEAM study design. Method: The TEAM study was conducted in small rural Veterans Administration community-based outpatient clinics with interactive video equipment available for mental health, but no on-site psychiatrists/psychologists. The study attempted to enroll all patient**s whose** depression could be appropriately treated in primary care. Results: The clinical characteristics of the 395 study participants differed significantly from most previous trials of collaborative care. At baseline, 41% were already receiving p**rimary **care depression treatment. Study participants averaged 5.5 chronic physical health illnesses and 56.5% had a comorbid anxiety disorder. Over half (57.2%) reported that pain impaired their functioning extremely or quite a bit. Conclusions: Despite small patient populations in rural clinics, enoug**h patie**nts with depression can be successfully enrolled to evaluate telemedicine-based collaborative care.  2006 Elsevier Inc.

25. **Feasibility and acceptability of clinic-based telepsychiatry for low-income hispanic primary care patients**
Background: The feasibility and acceptability of telepsychiatry for low-income Hispanic patients with **major** **depress**ion were assessed. Subjects and Methods: In total, 167 adult Hispanic patients with ma**jor dep**ression recruited from a community health center (CHC) were randomly assigned to receive psychiatry services through a video Webcam (WEB) (n=80) or to treatment as usual (TAU) (n=87). The WEB condition consisted of monthly telepsychiatry sessions at the CHC for 6 months provided by one of two Hispanic psychiatrists using an online virtual meeting program. TAU patients received their care from their providers. Acceptability was assessed by comparing appointment keeping for primary care versus telepsychiatry, patients' perceived working alliance with their provider, visit **satisfact**ion, **and ant**idepressant use. Feasibility was ass**essed u**sing depression **outcom**es, functional days (unproductive or days lost), and whether WEB and TAU patients differed in their appointment keeping. Results: WEB patients did not differ in the proportion of completed primary care versus telepsychiatry appointments and rated their working alliance with the psychiatrist and their vi**sit satis**faction significantly higher than the TAU patients with their provider. Significantly more WEB than TAU pa**tients **used antide**pressan**ts. Although depression severity decreased faster among WEB than TAU patients, no differences we**re foun**d in the overall depression score. WEB and TAU patients did not differ in the number of days that were **lost or** unproductive due to depression. Although WEB and TAU patients reported being willing to pay for mental health services provided by the CHC, almost proportionately twice as many WEB patients were willing to pay for telepsychiatry. Conclusions: R**esults **show that for low-income depressed Hispanic p**atients**, telepsychiatry service for depression is acceptable, although its feasibility is questionable. The benefits of telemedicine were discussed in terms of improving patient care in ways other than directly providing services to the patients.

26. **Relationships Among Depressive Symptoms, Benefit-Finding, Optimism, and Positive Affect in Multiple Sclerosis Patients After Psychotherapy for Depression**
Objective: While many patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) experience psychological problems, such as **depress**ion, benefit-finding is commonly reported. Using the Broaden-and-Build Model of positive emotions (Fredrickson, 2001) and the Expectancy-Value Model of optimism (Carver & Scheier, 1998) as two related, yet, distinct conceptual frameworks, this study examined positive affect and optimism as mediators of the relationship between impro**ved dep**ression and enhanced benefit-finding. Design: MS patients (N = 127), who participated in a larger, randomized clinical trial comparing two types of telephone psychother**apy for** depression, were assessed at baseline, midtherapy (8 weeks), end of therapy (16 weeks), and 6- and 12-month posttherapy. Main **Outcom****e Measu**res: Depression was measured with a telephone administered version of the Hamilton R**ating S**cale for Depression; Positive Affect was measured with the Positive Affect Subscale from the Positive and Negative Affect Scale; Optimism was measured with the Life Orientation Test-Revised; Benefit-Finding was measured with the revised version of the Stress-Related Growth Scale. Results: Data were analyzed with multilevel random-effects models, controlling for time since MS diagnosis and type of **treatme**nt. Improved depression was associated with increased benefit-finding over time. The relati**onship **between improved depression and benefit-finding was significantly mediated by both increased optimism and increased positive affect. Conclusion: Findings provide support to both theoretical models. Positivity appears to promote benefit-finding in MS.  2008 American Psychological Association. eid: 2-s2.0-43049091568
27. **Improving Adherence and Clinical Outcomes in Self-Guided Internet Treatment for Anxiety and Depression: Randomised Controlled Trial**
Background:**Depress**ion and anxiety are common, disabling and chronic. Self-guided internet-delivered treatments are popular, but few people complete them. New strategies are required to realise their potential.Aims:To evaluate the effect of automated emails on the effectiveness, safety, and acceptability of a new automated transdiagnostic self-guided internet-delivered treatment, the Wellbeing Course, for people w**ith dep**ression and anxiety.Method:A randomised controlled trial was conducted through the website: www.ecentreclinic.org. Two hundred and fifty seven people with elevated symptoms were randomly allocated to the 8 week course either with or without automated emails, or to a waitlist control group. Primary **outcom**e measures were the Patient Health Questionnaire 9-Item (PHQ-9) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item (GAD-7).Results:Participants in the treatment groups had lower PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores at post-treatment than controls. Automated emails increased rates of course completion (58% vs. 35%), and impro**ved ou**tcomes in a subsample with elevated symptoms.Conclusions:The new self-guided course was beneficial, and automated emails faci**litate**d outcomes. Further attention to strategies that facilitate adherence, learning, and safety will help realise the potential of self-guided interventions.Trial Registration: Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ACTRN12610001058066.  2013 Titov et al. eid: 2-s2.0-84879771201
28. **Patients' depression treatment preferences and initiation, adherence, and outcome: A randomized primary care study**
Objective: The authors examined the association of treatment preferences with treatment initiation, adherence, and clinical **outcom**e among nonsenior adult and senior primary care patients with **depress**ion. Methods: Sixty primary care participants meeting DSM-IV criteria for ma**jor dep**ression were randomly assigned to receive treatment congruent or incongruent with their primary stated preference. Participants received either 20 weeks of escitalopram, with monitoring by a care manager, or 12 weekly sessions of interpersonal psychotherapy followed by two monthly booster sessions. Adherence to treatm**ent and** depression severity were reassessed at weeks 4, 8, 12, and 24. Results: Participants expressed stronger preferences for psychotherapy t**han for** antidepressant medication. Preference strength was a more sensitive measure** of ou**tcome than was congruence versus incongruence of preference with the assigned treatment. Across age groups, preference strength was significantly associated with treatment initiation and 12-week adherence ra**te but **not with depression severity or remission. Conclusions: A continuous measure of preference strength may be a more useful measure in clinical practice than preferences per se. Future research should focus on whether and how greater facilitation of the treatment decision-making process between patient and clinician influences c**linica**l outcome. eid: 2-s2.0-61749099487
29. **A randomized trial of telemedicine-based collaborative care for depression**
BACKGROUND: Evidence-based practices designed for large urban clinics are not necessarily portable into smaller isolated clinics. Implementing practice-based collaborative care for **depress**ion in smaller primary care clinics presents unique challenges because it is often not feasible to employ on-site psychiatrists. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the Telemedicine Enhanced **Antidep**ressant Management (TEAM) study was to evaluate a telemedicine-based collaborative care model adapted for small clinics without on-site psychiatrists. DESIGN: Matched sites were randomized to the intervention or usual care. PARTICIPANTS: Small VA Community-based outpatient clinics with no on-site psychiatrists, but access to telepsychiatrists. In 2003-2004, 395 primary care patients wi**th PHQ9** depression severity scores 12 were enrolled, and followed for 12 months. Patients with serious mental illness and current substance dependence were excluded. MEASURES: Medication adherence, treatment response, remission, health status, health-related quality of life, and treatment **satisfact**ion. RESULTS: The sample comprised mostly elderly, white, males with substantial physical and behavioral health comorbidity. At baseline, subjects h**ad mode**rate depression severity (Hopkins Symptom Checklist, SCL-20 = **1.8), 3**.7 prior depression episodes, and 67%** had re**ceived prior depression treatment. Multivariate analyses indicated that intervention patients were more likely to be adherent at both 6 (odds ratio [OR] = 2.1, p = .04) and 12 months (OR = 2.7, p = .01). Intervention patients were more likely to respond by 6 months (OR = 2.0, p = .02), and remit by 12 months (OR = 2.4, p = .02). Intervention patients reported larger gains in mental health status and health-related quality of life, and reported hig**her satis**faction.

30. **Treatment outcomes in depression: Comparison of remote treatment through telepsychiatry to in-person treatment**
Objective: Telepsychiatry is an increasingly common method of providing psychiatric care, but randomized trials of telepsychiatric treatment compared to in-person treatment have not been done. The primary objective of this study was to compare treatment **outcom**es of patients with **depress**ive disorders treated remotely by means of telepsychiatry** to ou**tcomes** of dep**ressed patients treated in person. Secondary objectives were to determine if patients' rates of adherence to and **satisfact**ion with treatment were as high with telepsychiatric as with in-person treatment and to compare costs of telepsychiatric treatment to costs of in-person treatment. Method: In this randomized, controlled tri**al, 119** depressed veterans referred for outpatient treatment were randomly assigned to either remote treatment by means of telepsychiatry or in-person treatment. Psychiatric treatment lasted 6 months and consisted of psychotropic medication, psychoeducation, and brief supportive counseling. Patients' tr**eatmen**t outcom**es, satis**faction, and adherence and the costs of treatment were compared between the two conditions. Result**s: Hami**lton Depression Rating** Scale **and Beck Depression Inventory scores improved over the treatment period and did not differ between treatment groups. The two groups were equally adherent to appointments and medication treatment. No between-group differences in dropout rates or patients' rat**ings of s**atisfaction with treatment were found. Telepsychiatry was more expensive per treatment session, but this difference disappeared if the costs of psychiatrists' travel to remote clinics more than 22 miles away from the medical center were considered. Telepsychiatry did not increase the overall health care resource consumption of the patients during the study period. Conclusions: **Remote **treatment of depression by means of telepsychiatry and** in-per**son treatment of depression have** compa**rable outcomes and equivalent levels of patient adheren**ce, patie**nt satisfaction, and health care cost. eid: 2-s2.0-3342991837
31. **Internet treatment for depression: A randomized controlled trial comparing clinician vs. technician assistance**
Background: Internet-based cognitive behavioural therapy (iCBT) for **depress**ion is effective when guided by a clinician, less so if unguided. Question: Would guidance from a technician be as effective as guidance from a clinician? Method: Randomized controlled non-inferiority trial comparing three groups: Clinician-assisted vs. technician-assisted vs. delayed treatment. Community-based volunteers applied to the VirtualClinic (www.virtualclinic.org.au) research program, and 141 participants with ma**jor dep**ressive disorder were randomized. Participants in the clinician- and technician-assisted groups received access to an iCBT prog**ram for** depression comprising 6 online lessons, weekly homework assignments, and weekly supportive contact over a treatment period of 8 weeks. Participants in the clinician-assisted group also received access to a moderated online discussion forum. The main **outcom**e measures we**re the **Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 Item (PHQ-9). Completion rates were high, and at post-treatment, both treatment groups reduced scores on the BDI-II (p<0.001) and PHQ-9 (p<0.001) compared to the delayed treatment group but did not differ from each other. Within group effect sizes on the BDI-II were 1.27 and 1.20 for the clinician- and technician-assisted groups respectively, and on the PHQ-9, were 1.54 and 1.60 respectively. At 4-month follow-up participants in the technician group had made further improvements and had significantly lower scores on the PHQ-9 than those in the clinician group. A total of approximately 60 minutes of clinician or technician time was required per participant during the 8-week treatment program. Conclusions: Both clinician- and technician-assisted treatment resulted in large effect sizes and clinically significant improvements comparable to those associated with face-to-face treatment, while a delayed treatment control group did not improve. These results provide support for large scale trials to determine the clinical effectiveness and acceptability of technician-assisted iC**BT prog**rams for depression. This form of treatment has potential to increase the capacity of existing mental health services.

32. **Stepping up: Predictors of stepping within an icbt stepped-care intervention for depression**
Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) may overcome barriers to mental health care and has proven efficacious. However, this approach currently exists outside the existing mental health care delivery system. Stepped care is a proposed framework for integrating digital mental health (DMH) into health systems by initiating iCBT and stepping up care to a more intensive intervention should iCBT prove ineffective. This study explores pre-treatment factors associated with reaching stepping criteria among patients receiving iCBT. This exploratory analysis of a stepped care arm of a larger randomized trial examined participants who were stepped to a more intensive intervention if they did not respond to iCBT. The association of pre-treatment factors on stepping were examined using KruskalWallis and Chi-square tests. One-fifth of the 151 participants met criteria for stepping within the 20-week treatment period. Only pre-treatment **depress**ion severity and treatment preference were associated with increased likelihood of stepping (p = 0.049 and 0.048, respectively). The low number of individuals who stepped provides support for iCBT as an effective, low intensity treatment **for dep**ression. The modest association of pre-tr**eatment** depression and preference to not receive iCBT may be useful in identifying patients who are less likely to respond.  2019 by the authors.

33. **Findings from a trial of the smartphone and online usage-based evaluation for depression (SOLVD) application: What do apps really tell us about patients with depression? concordance between app-generated data and standard psychiatric questionnaires for depression and anxiety**
Objective: **Depress**ion imposes a notable societal burden, with limited treatment success despite multiple available psychotherapy and medications choices. Potential reasons may include the heterogeneity** of dep**ression diagnoses and the presence of comorbid anxiety symptoms. Despite technological advances and the introduction of many mobile phone applications (apps) claiming to **relieve** depression,**major** gaps in knowledge still exist regarding what apps truly measure and how they correlate with psychometric questionnaires. The goal of this study was to evaluate whether mobile daily mood self-ratings may be useful in monitoring and **classif**ying depression symptoms **in a cl**inically depressed population compared with standard psychometric instruments including the Patient Health Questionaire-9 (PHQ-9), the Hamilt**on Rati**ng Scale for Depression (HAM-D), and the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A). Method: For this study,** 22 pat**ients wit**h **m**ajor depress**ive disorder with or without comorbid anxiety disorder were **recruit**ed. The diagnosis of depression was confirmed through the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). Over an 8-week period, daily moods were selfreported through the Smartphone and On**Line Us**age-based eValuation for Depression (SOLVD) application, a custom-designed application that was downlo**aded on**to patients' mobile devices. Depression and anxiety symptoms were also measured biweekly using the HAM-D, HAM-A, and PHQ-9. Results: Significant correlations were observed among self-evaluated mood, daily steps taken, SMS (text) frequency, average call duration, and biweekly psychometric scores (|r| > 0.5, P <0.05). The correlation coefficients were** higher** in individuals with more severe depressive symptoms. Conclusions: Although this study, given its limited sample size, was exploratory in nature, it helps fill a significant gap in our knowledge of the concordance between ratings obtained on the Ham-D, Ham-A, and the PHQ-9 psychometric instruments and data obtained via a smartphone app. These questionnaires represent goldstandard, commonly used psychiatric research/ clinical instruments, and, thus, this information can serve **as a fo**undation for digital phenotyping for depression and pave the way for interventional studies using smartphone applications.

0. **A model for digital mental healthcare: Its usefulness and potential for service delivery in low- and middle-income countries**
Background: Using digital technology to deliver mental health care can possibly serve as a viable adjunct or alternative to mainstream services in lessening the mental health gap in a large number of resource deficient and LAMI countries. Conventional models of telepsychiatric services available so far, however, have been inadequate and ineffective, as these address only a small component of care, and rely on engagement of specialists who are grossly insufficient in numbers. Aim: To describe an innovative digital model of mental health care, enabling and empowering the non-specialists to deliver **high** quality mental health care in **remot**e areas. Methods: The model is powered by an online, fully automated clinical decision support **system** (CDSS), with interlinked modules for diagnosis, management and follow-up, usable by non-specialists after brief training and minimal supervision by psychiatrist, to deliver mental health care** at r**emote sites. Results: The CDSS has been found to** be **highly reliable, feasible, with sufficient sensitivity and specificity. This paper describes the model and initial experience with the digital mental health c**are sy**stem deployed in three geographically diffic**ult a**nd remote areas in northern hill states in India. The** onlin**e system was found to be reasonably comprehensive, brief, feasible, user-friendl**y, w**ith high levels of patient **satisfact**ion. 2594 patients assessed a**t the** three remote sites and the nodal center represented varied diagnoses. Conclusions: The digital model described here has the potential to serve as an effective alternative or adjunct for delivering compre**hens**ive and high quality mental health care in LAMI countries like India in the primary and secondary care settings.  2019 Indian Journal of Psychiatry. eid: 2-s2.0-85059851863

As a pioneer of training in the field of psychology, the Veterans Affairs (VA) HealthCare **System** serves as a leader in the training in and provision of Telemental Health (TMH) services in the United States. To meet goals toward continued expansion of these services, the VA TMH training program includes both web-based didactic courses and a skills competency test at a basic level with supervision and consultation in TMH for more advanced training and is available to staff psychologists and psychologist trainees. Despite these efforts, barriers for training in and implementation of TMH occur at the provid**er, sy**stem, and patient level. At the national level, the VA is actively working to resolve these barriers and we share site-specific examples implemented by the VA Puget Sound Heal**th Car**e System promoting access through TMH team to further address barriers to training and implementation.  2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-85085358844
2. **Parental attitudes to a telehealth parent coaching intervention for autism spectrum disorder**
Introduction: This study examined the potential feasibility of tele-delivered **parent** coaching in a rural area of Italy through a survey** of pa**rents attitudes towards this type of intervention. M**ethods**: Parents of all **child**ren up to six years of age registered with a diagnosis of **autism** spectrum disorder at the clinic catering for the area were invited to take part in the study. The final sample cons**isted **of 43 pa**rents.** Results: Parents with worse Internet skills and those who reported lower levels of **satisfact**ion with currently received services were less likely to be willing to enrol. Th**ere wa**s a trend for parents with lower self-efficacy to be less likely to enrol. Educational level, previous experience of video-calling, travel time to the clinic **and c**hilds level of ability were not associated with the choice of enrolment. Discussion: Implications for strategies to contrast barriers to adoption and strengthen implementation plans are discussed.  2016,  The Author(s) 2016. eid: 2-s2.0-85018777751

Using a pre/post design, families (N = 13) from low socioeconomic backgrounds in Kentucky completed the Group Triple P via a videoconferencing delivery format. A benchmarking strategy (Weersing & Hamilton, 2005) indicated that treatment effect sizes for the videoconferencing format were generally comparable to treatment effect sizes for Group Triple P studies conducted in-person. Specif**icall**y, child behav**ior an**d parenting outcomes were similar across delivery formats.

4. **Usability and reliability of a remotely administered adult autism assessment, the autism diagnostic observation schedule (ADOS) module 4**
Introduction: The **Autism** Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) Module 4 is** an au**tism assessment designed for verbally fluent adolescents and adults. Because of a shortage of available clinical expertise, it can be difficult for adults to receive a** prope**r **autism spectrum** disorder (ASD) diagnostic assessment. A potential option to address this shortage is **remot**e assessment. The objective of this study was to examine the feasibility, usability, and reliability of administering the ADOS Modul**e 4 r**emotely using the Versatile and Integrated **System** for Telerehabilitation (VISYTER). Materials and Methods: VISYTER consists of computer stations at the client site and clinician site for video communication and a Web portal for managing and coordinating the assessment process. Twenty-three adults with an ASD diagnosis participated in a within-subject crossover design study in which** both** a remote ADOS and a face-to-face ADOS were administered. After com**pleti**ng the remote ADOS, participants completed a **satisfact**ion survey. Results: Participant satisf**actio**n with the remote ADOS deliv**ery sy**stem was **high**. The kappa value was greater than 0.61 on 21 of 31 ADOS items. There was substantial agreement on ADOS classification (i.e., diagnosis) between assessments delivered face-to-face versus as**sessm**ents delivered remotely (interclass coefficient=0.92). Non-agreement may have been due to outside factors or practice effect despite a washout period. Conclusions: The results of this study demonstr**ate th**at an autism assessment designed to be delivered face to f**ace c**an be administered remotely using an integrated We**b-base**d system w**ith **high levels of usability and reliability.

5. **An integrated telehealth system for remote administration of an adult autism assessment**
We developed a telehealth **system** to administer an **autism** assessment **remot**ely. **The r**emote assessm**ent sy**stem integrates videoconferencing, stimuli presentation, recording, image and video presentation, and electronic assessment scoring into an intuitive software platform. This is an advancement over existing technologies used in telemental health, which currently require several devices. The number of **child**ren, adolescents, and adults w**ith au**tism spectrum disorders (ASDs) has increased dramatically over the past 20 years and is expected to continue to increase in coming years. In general, there are not many clinicians trained in either the diagnosis or treatment of adults with ASD. Given the number of adul**ts wit**h autism in **need,** a remote ass**essmen**t system can potentially provide a solution to the lack of trained clinicians. The goal is **to ma**ke the remote** asses**sment system as close to face-to-face assessment as possible, yet versatile enough to support deployment in underserved areas. The primary challenge to achieving this goal is that the assessment requires social interaction that appears natural and fl**uid****, so t**he remote system needs to be able to support fluid natural interaction. For this study we developed components to support this type of interaction and integrated thes**e comp**onents into a system capable of supporting the entire autistic assessment protocol. **We the**n implemented t**he sys**tem and **evalu**ated the system on real patients. The results suggest that we have ac**hieved** our goal in developing a system with **high**-quality interaction that is easy to use.

7. **A web-based tutorial for parents of young children with Autism: Results from a pilot study**
Objective: Early intervention can significantly improve long-term outcomes for **child**ren with **autism**. Unfortunately, m**any c**hildren do not receive early intervention services due to a critical shortage of trained professionals in this area. To bridge this gap, we **evalu**ated a Web-based **parent** training tutorial (Enhancing Interactions), based on evidence-based practices and utilizing the Web-based platform to maximize learning. Methods: Twenty-th**ree pa**rents** with** a child between 18 months and 6 years with** an au**tism spectrum disorder participated. Pre-and posttest sc**ores o**f parents' knowledge were used** to e**valuate tutorial effectiveness. The **system** usability scal**e (SU**S) evaluated technical user-friendliness and the user **satisfact**ion questionnaire (USQ), gau**ged satis**faction with content. Results: The mean number of correct items on the posttest significantly increased, from 12.6 to 20.4, p<0.001. The mean SUS score was 85 (standard deviation=17), corresponding to a score of "excellent." All participants found the tutorial user friendly, well integrated, and 96% (all but one participant) thought it was easy to use, felt confident using the technical features, and would use a tutorial like this again. On the USQ, all participants found that the tutorial was well organized, clearly presented, and easy to understand; that it increased their knowledge about communicating** with** their child; and that they felt capable of applying these techni**ques **with their child. Conclusions: The tutorial appears effective in** incre**asing parents' knowledge with hi**gh user s**atisfaction.  2011, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-82455179552

9. **Telemedicine and autism spectrum disorder in children and adolescents: Theoretical and practical guide [Tlmdecine et troubles du spectre de l'autisme de l'enfant et de l'adolescent: guide thorique et pratique]**
Objectives: The development of telemedicine for **child**ren and adolescents is a real need because of difficult accessibility of mental health and the paucity** of c**hildhood psychiatrists. Thus the American Acad**emy f**or Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP) published in 2008 good practice recommendations for teleps**ychia**try in children and adolescents based on clinical consensus and scientific evidence. In France the legal framework defines four practical modalities according to the presence or not of a health professional or a psychologist with the practitioner accomplishing the teleconsultation act. Data exist about** the **outcome of children and adolescents who benefited from therapeutic interventions with technological media. Effect size is modest but it doesn't justify ruling ou**t the**se techniques. Children who present with a developmental disorder or who cannot cooperate are **evalu**ated with a certain degree of uncerta**inty.** By contrast, some children with severe Attention Deficit with or without Hyperactivity (ADHD), social anxiety or **Autism** Spectrum Disorders (ASD) can be more easily engaged within a teleconsultation model. Teleconsultations** in au**tism spectrum disorders (ASD) are feasible because of the nature of diagnosis and the type of care recommended in this disorder. The behavioral nature of the disorder and the behavioral therapeutic approaches recommended in North America culture **high**light the potential interest of telemedicine because these disorders are easily observable. Literature suggests new opportunities in order to facilitate the care process for the ASD person and his family: the first one is diagnosis with use of validated instruments such** as th**e Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (AD**OS) an**d the Autism Diagnostic Interview (ADI). **Parent**al accompaniment is the second opportunity. Development of telemedicine for ASD could be a complementary approach for diagnosis and medical care. Method: Since 2015, a program called PROMETTED (PROgramme MEdical de Tlpsychiatrie pour enfants et adolescents prsentant un Trouble Envahissant du Dveloppement) was supported by Regional Health Agency of le-de-France. It was developed and managed by the team of a Diagnosis Cente**r** E**valu**ation for Autism (DCEA) of Paris area in collaboration with a DCEA of le-de-France region. Five m**edico**-social structures for children and adolescents with autistic disorders and the two diagnosis center**s of e**valuation for autism co-elaborated a scheme of intervention with telemedicine. The **r**emot****e evaluation is a 4-step process: a first teleconsultation structured around the medical history of the subject in order to complete his medical file and the observation of the young subject; a second teleconsultation structured around the ADI-R interview w**ith pa**rents; the third teleconsultation is a mixed teleconsultation associating the medical expert of the DCEA and a psychologis**t tra**ined in t**he use** of the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) and the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (VABS). The fourth teleconsultation consists of the psychiatrist giving feed-**back t**o parents about the results of the observations of the DCEA team. Results: The four-step program is well-accepted and the use of validated instruments for diagnosis or** func**tional evaluation appears feasible. Medical data were completed for 44% of cases; complementary genetic or medical investigations were prescribed for 50% of cases; medical advice about psychotropic or vitaminic medication was given for 31% of cases. M**ean d**uration of evaluation was 11.1 weeks  9.4. Conclusions: The PROMETTED program empirically validates t**he co****ncept**** of r**emote evaluation for children and adolescents with ASD. The need to extend the use of telemedicine to tele-expertise for medicine monitoring or behavioral disorder management has been noted.  2019 Elsevier Masson SAS eid: 2-s2.0-85065535811

0. **Videoconferencing in a mental health service in The Netherlands: A randomized controlled trial on patient satisfaction and clinical outcomes for outpatients with severe mental illness**
Introduction: The goal of the study was to determinate if there was added value in the use of videoconferencing (VCF) in outpatient care for people with severe mental illness (SMI). Methods: A VCF-group was compared to a control group (care as usual) over a **period** of 18 months. Block randomization was used to assign patients to one of the two groups. The video communication was available to the patients on a 24/7 basis, so that emergency calls could also be made via VCF. The primary outcome was patient **satisfact**ion, other outcomes were: quality of life, loneliness, daily functioning (psychologically and socially), and the fulfilment of needs of care. Eventually, 93 patients signed their informed consent and participated. Results: For the primary outcome a statistically significant time by treatment interaction effect was found, where higher degree** of satis**faction was associated with the patients in the VCF-group. The secondary outcomes revealed no differences between the two groups. Despite the participants not using the VCF units extensively during the project, they were reasonably satisfied with VCF; on average, they rated the service with a 7.5 grade (on a scale from 110). Discussion: Although the study showed a positive result for **patient s**atisfaction, overall the VCF seemed to have limited impact. So VCF might not offer much added value to care as usual. However, statistical power in this study dropped somewhat due to dropout. Furthermore, VCF usage was lower than expected. Assuming that VCF will be most effective if it is actually used, it seems likely that the actual effect-size reached in this study has been significantly lower than the anticipated effect-size. Finally, this study shows that VCF is a tool that can be used in the care for people with severe mental illness.  2016,  The Author(s) 2016. eid: 2-s2.0-85020199870
1. **An experimental comparison of telepsychiatry and conventional psychiatry for parolees**
Objective: Many offenders treated for psychiatric disorders while incarcerated are paroled to counties where psychiatric care is limited, leading some correctional departments to offer psychiatric treatment via videoconferencing ("telepsychiatry"). However, the effectiveness of telepsychiatry for offenders with psychiatric disorders has not been rigorously **evalu**ated. Methods: In this randomized field experiment, the authors compared the effectiveness of telepsychiatry and in-person psychiatric sessions (treatment as usual) among 71 parolees receiving outpatient psychiatric treatment over a six-month **period**. **Satisfact**ion with treatment, therapeutic alliance, medication adherence, and psychological functioning were measured. Follow-up data were collected from 60 of the 71 (85%) patients (N520, telepsychiatry; N540, control condition). Results: Findings revealed h**igh satis**faction with telepsychiatry overall and no significant group differences in medication adherence or psychological functioning. However, telepsychiatry patients reported lower levels of therapeutic alliance at follow-up. Conclusions: Telepsychiatry appeared to be an acceptable and effective approach for providing psychiatric care for this population. eid: 2-s2.0-84989933045
2. **Satisfaction with long-distance motivational interviewing for problem drinking**
OBJECTIVES: To examine the relationship between participant preference and **satisfact**ion with live interactive video, telephone, or face-to-face motivational interviewing sessions with problem drinkers. METHODS: Participants complete**d a satis**faction questionnaire after each motivational interviewing counseling session utilizing an abbreviated Likert scale. The participants were asked what mode they would have preferred**, their s**atisfaction with their counselor**, and the**ir satisfaction with overall counseling. RESULTS: When asked to choose a long-distance mode of communication, televideo was preferred more than 2:1 over telephone. Also those with televideo experience were significantly more likely to choose televideo as a preferred long-distance mode of choice. CONCLUSIONS: Findings support the acceptability of 2 forms of long-distance communication, telephone and televideo, which might reasonably be studied in the future in rural areas (with some preference for televideo) to reduce heavy drinking and alcohol-related problems.  2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-33947185640
3. **Telepsychiatry appointments in a continuing care setting: Kept, cancelled and no-shows**
We reviewed the appointment data for a psychiatry service in California that provided consultations and also therapy through telepsychiatry. Over an 18-month **period**, there were 7523 telepsychiatry appointments and 115,148 conventional (face-to-face) appointments. A higher proportion of the telepsychiatry appointments was kept (92% telepsychiatry vs. 87% non-telepsychiatry). Also, telepsychiatry appointments were significantly less likely to be cancelled by patients (3.5% vs. 4.8%) and significantly less likely to be no-shows (4.2% vs. 7.8%). These findings were similar in three of the four counties where the service was delivered. However, one county was different, and further examination suggested that the morale of the staff and patients may have contributed to the unenthusiastic acceptance of telepsychiatry. We conclude that telepsychiatry can be used effectively in continuing care settings as well as in **evalu**ation settings, and that staff and patient morale are important factors in successful telepsychiatry. eid: 2-s2.0-70349696011
4. **Agreement on web-based diagnoses and severity of mental health problems in norwegian child and adolescent mental health services**
Objective: This study examined the agreement between diagnoses and severity ratings assigned by clinicians using a structured web-based interview within a child and adolescent mental health outpatient setting. Method: Information on 100 youths was obtained from multiple informants through a web-based Development and Well-Being Assessment (DAWBA). Based on this information, four experienced clinicians independently diagnosed (according to the International Classification of Diseases Revision 10) and rated the severity of mental health problems according to the Health of the Nation Outcome Scales for Children and Adolescents (HoNOSCA) and the Children's Global Assessment Scale (C-GAS). Results: Agreement for diagnosis was K=0.69-0.82. Intra-class correlation for single measures was 0.78 for HoNOSCA and 0.74 for C-GAS, and 0.93 and 0.92, respectively for average measures. Conclusions: Agreement was good to excellent for all diagnostic categories. Agreement for severity was moderate, but improved to substantial when the average of the ratings given by all clinicians was considered. Therefore, we conclude that experienced clinicians can assign reliable diagnoses and assess severity based on DAWBA data collected online.

5. **The North Lewisham Telepsychiatry Project: Beyond the Pilot Phase**
The integration of a telepsychiatry application into an inner-city community **mental health servic**e was **evalu**ated over 10 months. ISDN videoconferencing at 128 kbit/s was employed for psychiatric consultation between a primary care centre and a community mental health centre. A convenience sample of patients and referrals seen by videoconferencing was compared with a sample seen **face to fac**e. During the study **period** 19 patients were managed by videoconferencing and** 12 face to** face. There were 162 consultations, comprising 81 prearranged **teleconsult**ations and 81 prearranged face-to-face consultations. There was no significant difference in attendance between videoconferencing and face-to-face consultations. Nine of the videoconferencing new referrals had not completed their treatment at the end of the st**udy pe**riod, compared with only three in the face-to-face group. This implies that it takes longer to complete treatment for new referrals managed by videoconferencing.  2002, SAGE Publications. All rights reserved. eid: 2-s2.0-18144452475
6. **Evaluation of a rural telepsychiatry service**
Objective: To **evalu**ate a telepsychiatry clinical service to Wagga Wagga in rural New South Wales, comprising a face-to-face interview with a psychiatrist followed by a telepsychiatry interview with a Sydney-based psychiatrist. Methods: Thirty-one patients were referred to a specialist mood disorder clinic in a rural setting for consultation and assessment. A retrospect**ive e**valuation was made to determine the acceptance of the teleconferenced psychiatry and face-to-face psychiatry, as well as the overall patient response. Results: Twenty participants comple**ted a**ll evaluation components. Their results indicated a **satisfact**ion level of 95% with the consultation process as a whole, with 80% happy to use telepsychiatry again and 60% preferring telepsychiatry over travelling to a larger centre for face-to-face consultation. The face-to-face component **was satis**factory for 85% of patients while the telepsychiatry compon**ent was s**atisfactory for 72%. Conclusions: Although face-to-face psychiatry was preferred by this sample, the telepsychiatry component was highly rated and preferred over travel to larger centres for face-to-face consultation, by residents of rural and remote locations. Certain issues are of more concern in telepsychiatry than face-to-face psychiatry, including confidentiality, rapport, explanation and education. eid: 2-s2.0-4744354629
7. **Agreement between telepsychiatry assessment and face-to-face assessment for Emergency Department psychiatry patients**
We compared psychiatrists' **evalu**ations of Emergency Department (ED) mental health patients made face-to-face or by telemedicine. In a 39-month study, 73 patients presenting in the ED were enrolled after initial screening. Patients were interviewed by a psychiatrist either face-to-face in the ED or remotely by video. A second psychiatrist, acting as an observer, was in the room with the patient and independently completed the assessment. Based on the primary diagnosis of the interviewer, 48% of patients had a depressive disorder, 18% a substance use disorder, 14% a bipolar disorder, 11% a psychotic disorder, 6% an anxiety disorder and 4% other disorders. The raw agreement between the psychiatrists about disposition when both used face-to-face assessment was 84% and it was 86% when one used telemedicine. Using Cohen's kappa** to e**valuate agreement, there were no significant differences for disposition recommendation, strength of recommendation, diagnosis or the HCR-20 dangerousness scale. There was no significant difference for the intraclass correlation coefficients for the suicide scale. The results provide preliminary support for the safe use of telepsychiatry in the ED to determine the need for admission to inpatient care.

8. **International telepsychiatry: A study of patient acceptability**
An international telepsychiatry service was established between Denmark and Sweden for cross-cultural patient groups, such as asylum seekers, refugees and migrants. Over an 18-month **period** starting in mid 2006, 30 patients were treated by telepsychiatry (21 men and 9 women). The patients received mental health care by videoconferencing from providers who spoke the patients' own language, i.e. without the assistance of interpreters. The total number of telepsychiatry sessions was 203 (range 1-22; average 6.8 sessions per patient). Patients completed a **satisfact**ion questionnaire at the end of treatment. Seven patients (23%) were not able to complete a questionnaire, due to illiteracy and/or a psychotic condition. The rest of the patients (n=23) reported a high level of acceptance **and satis**faction with telepsychiatry, as well as a willingness to use it again or recommend it to others. Any disadvantages of telemedicine were compensated by the fact that the doctor and patient spoke the same language and had similar cultural and/or national references. Mentally ill asylum seekers, refugees and migrants are under-served in their mother tongue and telepsychiatry can improve access to scarce health-care resources. eid: 2-s2.0-64549119584
9. **Telepsychiatry in the Heartland: If we build it, will they come**
The quality of care provided by telemedicine and its acceptability to persons who live in rural areas is largely undetermined. In this study, service **satisfact**ion and functional status in persons using telemedicine was compared to those receiving face-to-face services at two rural sites over a 2-year study **period**. Similar ratings** of satis**faction and clinical status were observed in twelve patients who received services under both modalities. Although there are many obstacles to successful program implementation, telepsychiatry appears to offer an acceptable and adequate alternative mode of service delivery to persons who live in rural areas. eid: 2-s2.0-0035486683
10. **Psychiatrists' satisfaction with telepsychiatry**
The purpose of this **evalu**ation study was to learn more about psychiatrists' **satisfact**ion with telepsychiatry. Telepsychiatry will succeed only if psychiatrists are satisfied with this service delivery method and offer it to their patients. While telepsychiatry appears to be effective and most patients report that they are satisfied with it, less information is available about factors that lead to psychiatris**ts' satis**faction. We interviewed psychiatrists who treat rural/frontier patients and asked them to describe factors that encouraged or discouraged their use of telepsychiatry. Only 4 were mostly satisfied with telepsychiatry and all offered suggestions for improving this delivery method. Most agreed that it was a hardship for many of their patients to travel 100 to 750 roundtrip miles over a 1-3 day **period** for a 20-minute consultation and that telepsychiatry could be a lifeline to many of them. Nevertheless, they identified significant technical and interpersonal barriers that discouraged their use of telepsychiatry.  Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-33847757200
11. **The use of telepsychiatry in the brief counselling of non-psychotic patients from an inner-London general practice**
Brief counselling of 13 non-psychotic patients was carried out using an interactive television link, in order to assess patient **satisfact**ion with this technique. Informed consent was obtained from all patients before the videoconferencing sessions, which were conducted at 128 kbit/s. Over the four-month study **period**, 11 men and two women participated in a total of 29 sessions. A total of 28 questionnaires were completed. After the sessions, 93% of patients agreed that they would like to use this medium for communication again, 75% stated that they were able to see everything that they needed to see and 86% agreed that they were able to hear everything they needed to hear. Overall, these findings indicate that patients were happy with the standard of care they received. eid: 2-s2.0-2842511204
12. **The effectiveness of telepsychiatry measured using the Health of the Nation Outcome Scale and the Mental Health Inventory**
In a telepsychiatry project in rural Queensland, data were collected from 124 patients attending hospital and general practice facilities for mental health-care and then again at follow-up one year later. Thirty-two of the patients were dealt with using telepsychiatry. Two health status scales were used to measure effectiveness: the Health of the Nation Outcome Scale (HoNOS), administered by the practitioners; and the Mental Health Inventory (MHI), which was self-administered by the patients. There was a significant difference between the initial assessment and follow-up groups on most subscales of the HoNOS, but no significant difference between the face-to-face and telepsychiatry groups. Similarly, the MHI results showed a significant difference on all subscales between the initial assessment and follow-up groups, but no significant difference between the face-to-face and telepsychiatry groups. Individuals who used and did not use telepsychiatry all had improved health outcome scores on the HoNOS and MHI during the study **period**. Telepsychiatry was as effective as face-to-face care. eid: 2-s2.0-0037264574
13. **Telehealth service delivery for persons with alcoholism**
Videoconferencing at a bandwidth of 384 kbit/s was used in open sessions for subjects with alcohol use disorders (AUD). Study participants received eight sessions of group therapy over a four-week **period** from an accredited addictions counsellor. Outcome assessment included self-report measures, a qualitative interview and a chart review. Of the 18 subjects who started the study, 14 attended at least four sessions of therapy, completed self-report assessments and the thematic interview. The participants reported high levels of **satisfact**ion with telepsychiatry, found the intervention to be highly credible, had good session attendance and attrition comparable to that expected with conventional same-room treatment. In all, 82% of subjects reported that they would recommend the service to a friend or family member. The results demonstrate the feasibility of using videoconferencing for service delivery to adults with AUD, and encourage the future performance of randomized controlled trials. eid: 2-s2.0-31544443531
14. **A referrer and patient evaluation of a telepsychiatry consultation-liaison service in South Australia**
A study was carried out to describe the patient population assessed by a telepsychiatry consultation-liaison service in rural South Australia, and to assess the referrers' and patients' **satisfact**ion rating with this service. The study was performed in two parts, with retrospective and prospective components. The author completed a semi-structured interview for each patient (n=75) with a Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) for the prospective group (n=32). A questionnaire was also sent to all referrers seeking an **evalu**ation of the usefulness of the telepsychiatry interview in terms of assessment and management recommendations and outcome. Patients from the prospective group were sent a questionnaire examining th**eir e**valuation of the usefulness of the interview in terms of assessment and management recommendations, and difficulties with the technology. The patient population was characterized by high rates of affective disorder and personality disorder, and high indices of developmental disturbance. Referrers reported high rates** of satis**faction with the service. Nursing staff rated the service more positively than general practitioners. The usefulness for assessment was rated more highly than for management. eid: 2-s2.0-0030632517
15. **Does the Use of Telemental Health Alter the Treatment Experience? Inmates' Perceptions of Telemental Health Versus Face-to-Face Treatment Modalities**
In corrections, where staffing limitations tax an overburdened mental health system, telemental health is an increasingly common mode of **mental health servic**e delivery. Although telemental health presents an efficient treatment modality for a spectrum** of mental health se**rvices, it is imperative to study how this modality influences key elements of the treatment experience. In this study, the authors compared inmates' perceptions of the working alliance, postsession mood, and **satisfact**ion with psychiatric and psycho**logical mental healt**h services delivered through 2 different modalities: telemental health and face-to-face. Participants consisted of 186 inmates w**ho received mental h**ealth services (36 via telepsychology, 50 via face-to-face psychology, 50 via telepsychiatry, and 50 via face-to-face psychiatry). Results indicate no significant differences in inmates' perceptions of the work alliance with the mental health professional, postsession mood, or over**all satis**faction with services when telemental health and face-to-face modalities were compared with**in each type of ment**al health service.

16. **Client satisfaction in a feasibility study comparing face-to-face interviews with telepsychiatry**
We carried out a pilot study comparing **satisfact**ion levels between psychiatric patients seen **face to fac**e (FTF) and those seen via videoconference. Patients who consented were randomly assigned to one of two groups. One group received services in person (FTF from the visiting psychiatrist) while the other was seen using videoconferencing at 128 kbit/s. One psychiatrist provided all the FTF and videoconferencing assessment and follow-up visits. A total of 24 subjects were recruited. Three of the subjects (13%) did not attend their appointments and two subjects in each group were lost to follow-up. Thus there were nine in the FTF group and eight in the videoconferencing group. The two groups were similar in most respects. Pati**ent satis**faction with the services was assessed using the** Client S**atisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8), completed four months after the initial consultation. The mean scores were 25.3 in the FTF group and 21.6 in the videoconferencing group. Although there was a trend in favour of the FTF service, the difference was not significa**nt. Patie**nt satisfaction is only one component of **evalu**ation. The efficacy of telepsychiatry must also be measured relative to that of conventional, FTF care before policy makers can decide how extensively telepsychiatry should be implemented.  2002, Royal Society of Medicine Press Limited.

17. **A randomized, controlled trial of child psychiatric assessments conducted using videoconferencing**
We used a PC-based videoconferencing system to conduct child psychiatry assessments. The telecommunications link was six digital lines, giving a total bandwidth of 336 kbit/s. Twenty-three patients (aged 4-16 years), accompanied by their parents, completed two psychiatric assessments, one via videoconferencing and another **face to fac**e (FTF). The order of assessments was randomized. Questionnaires were used to record the diagnosis, treatment recommendations and the psychiatrists', patients' and their parents' **satisfact**ion with each assessment. An independent **evalu**ator concluded that in 22 cases (96%) the diagnosis and treatment recommendations made via the videoconferencing system were the same as those made FTF. The psychiatrists stated that videoconferencing assessments were an adequate alternative to FTF assessments and did not interfere with diagnosis. However, the responses from the psychiatr**ist satis**faction questionnaire showed that they preferred FTF assessments. No significant difference was found in the patients' or p**arents' s**atisfaction responses after the two types of assessment. The majority of children (82%) 'liked' using the telepsychiatry system and six (26%) preferred it to a FTF assessment. Most parents (91%) indicated that they would prefer to use the videoconferencing system than to travel a long distance to see a psychiatrist in person. eid: 2-s2.0-19244381817
18. **Is telepsychiatry equivalent to face-to-face psychiatry? Results from a randomized controlled equivalence trial**
Objective: The use of interactive videoconferencing to provide psychiatric services to geographically remote regions, often referred to as telepsychiatry, has gained wide acceptance. However, it is not known whether clinical outcomes of telepsychiatry are as good as those achieved through face-to-face contact. This study compared a variety of clinical outcomes after psychiatric consultation and, where needed, brief follow-up for outpatients referred to a psychiatric clinic in Canada who were randomly assigned to be examined **face to fac**e or by telepsychiatry. Methods: A total of 495 patients in Ontario, Canada, referred by their family physician for psychiatric consultation were randomly assigned to be exami**ned face to** face (N=254) or by telepsychiatry (N=241). The treating psychiatrists had the option of providing monthly follow-up appointments for up to four months. The study tested the equivalence of the two forms of service delivery on a variety of outcome measures. Results: Psychiatric consultation and follow-up delivered by telepsychiatry produced clinical outcomes that were equivalent to those achieved when the service was p**rovided fac**e to face. Patients in the two groups expressed similar levels of **satisfact**ion with service. An analysis limited to the cost of providing the clinical service indicated that telepsychiatry was at least 10% less expensive per patient than servi**ce provided** face to face. Conclusions: Psychiatric consultation and short-term follow-up can be as effective when delivered by telepsychiatry a**s when prov**ided face to face. These findings do not necessarily mean that other types of **mental health servic**es, for example, various types of psychotherapy, are as effective when provided by telepsychiatry. eid: 2-s2.0-34250894450
19. **Disagreement in satisfaction between patients and providers in the use of videoconferences by depressed adults**
Aim: To **evalu**ate whether there was a difference in **satisfact**ion scores between providers and patients in the use of videoconferences (VCs) by depressed adults. Method: This study was a subanalysis of the joint European project, MasterMind, and participants were recruited from 15 pilot studies in 11 different countries. The Cli**ent Satis**faction Questionnaire (CSQ)-3 was used as assessment tool, and scores were summed to give total scores. The questionnaire consists of three it**ems e**valuating **general s**atisfaction, fulfillment of needs in treatment, and usability. Results: A total of 362 respondents, 201 patients and 161 providers, completed the questionnaire. Providers had a mean total CSQ-3 score of 9.17 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 8.90-9.45), whereas patients had a mean of 9.70 (95% CI = 9.44-9.98). Mean scores for item 1 (the extent to which VCs had met the needs of the participants): Patients 3.19, providers 2.93 (p = 0.00048); for item** 2 (gener**al satisfaction): Patients 3.22, providers 3.08 (p = 0.083); and item 3 (whether participants wanted to use VCs again): Patients 3.28 providers 3.16 (p = 0.045). Conclusion: The results sh**owed that** total satisfaction scores were higher in patients than in providers. The differences between patients and providers were significant for items 1 and 3 (p < 0.05), but we did not find a significant difference regarding item 2.  2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. eid: 2-s2.0-85084654748
20. **Telepsychiatry- based care for the treatment follow-up of iranian war veterans with post- traumatic stress disorder: A randomized controlled trial**
Background: Physical limitations, distance, and time are major obstacles to access to **mental health servic**es for veterans and soldiers. This study was aimed at comparing the efficacy of telepsychiatry and face-to-face consultation as methods of treating post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The comparison was based on treatment costs, access to health services, completion of therapy sessions, and patient **satisfact**ion as variables. Methods: This research was a double blinded clinical trial supported by Tabriz University of Medical Sciences and conducted in 2015 to 2016 in Tabriz, Iran. Totally, 60 patients were included in the study. Through simple randomization, the patients were divided into experimental and control groups, both of whom were treated through face-to-face consultations for the first 3 sessions. Six follow-up sessions were then held remotely with the experimental group and **face to fac**e with the control group. Data were collected using a self-designed and reliable questionnaire and entered in SPSS, version 16. Intergroup comparisons were performed using descriptive statistical measures. Finally, the results were tested using the t test method. Results: A significant relationship was found between the use of information technology and increased pati**ent satis**faction, completion of therapy sessions, and reduction in treatment costs; however, no significant difference was found between the groups in terms of reduction in waiting time and access to a psychiatrist. Conclusion: Telepsychiatry is an effective means of deliver**ing mental health se**rvices to psychiatric outpatients living in remote areas with limited resources. The results provide preliminary support for the use of telepsychiatry in treating PTSD and improving access to care.  2019, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences.

21. **Telepsychiatry and patient-provider concordance**
Context: Telepsychiatry has become a common modality for the provision of psychiatric consultations to patients in rural regions. Aims: The aims of this study were to assess and compare patient and provider **satisfact**ion and perceptions of access to care with telepsychiatry. Methods: Telepsychiatric consultations were given by providers based on an urban tertiary academic health centre to patients located in rural primary care clinics. Results: Patients (n = 110) and providers (n = 10) were both highly satisfied with telepsychiatry and both believed that telepsychiatry provided patients with better access to care. Paired patient and provider survey results demonstrated a high level of concordance between patients and provider responses. Conclusions: Concordance between patient and provi**der satis**faction may contribute to adherence and positive treatment outcomes. These results provide support for the use of telepsychiatry consultations to improve patient access to psychiatric care in rural regions.Contexte: La tlpsychiatrie est maintenant une modalit courante de prestation de services psychiatriques aux patients vivant en rgions rurales.

22. **Evaluating the diagnostic agreement between telepsychiatry assessment and face-to-face visit: A preliminary study**
Objective: Despite accumulated evidence that demonstrates clinical outcome of telepsychiatry is comparable with conventional method; little research has been done on telepsychiatry in developing countries. This study aimed to **evalu**ate the diagnostic agreement between telepsychiatry assessment and face-to-face assessment. Moreover, patient and doctor **satisfact**ion was assessed by self-report questionnaire. Method: This study was conducted in an inpatient department of a university-affiliated hospital in Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Iran. The study sample consisted of 40 inpatients aged over 18 years who were selected from October 2016 to February 2017. All patients were visited once by face-to-face conventional method and once by interactive video **teleconsult**ation by 2 psychiatric consultants. Results: Results of this study revealed that the diagnostic agreement between the 2 interviewers was 75%. Moreover, about 85% of the patients preferred telepsychiatry for follow-up visits. Also, more than 82% of the patients would recommend telepsychiatry to others although 95% of them perceived contact via telepsychiatry as uncomfortable to some extent. Conclusion: Telepsychiatry service can be used for psychiat**ric e**valuation in Iran, and it has a desirable effect on patient and doc**tor satis**faction. The results of this study showed the capacity of moving towards using telepsychiatry.  2020 Korean Cancer Association. All rights reserved. eid: 2-s2.0-85083399092
